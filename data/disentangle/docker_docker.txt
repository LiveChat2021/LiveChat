1 [2016-11-21T13:06:23] <sirroland> Hello. Help solve the problem please.Dockerfile: [<-CODE->] When I run a container returns an error: [<-CODE->] (but /root/run.sh File exists)
2 [2016-11-21T13:09:37] <sirroland> in Dockerfile all right, I'm wrong here\nNow I will try, thank you
3 [2016-11-21T13:10:30] <sirroland>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2016-11-21T13:11:23] <krzysztof-magosa> you can try also with /bin/sh

1 [2016-11-21T14:58:00] <gudron> Hi guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-21T14:59:21] <gudron> i have stupd question;i have two physical server with docker engine on board.1 - with mysql container2 - with apps containers
2 [2016-11-21T15:00:52] <gudron> I need to create a network between the two docker-host
3 [2016-11-21T15:01:27] <gudron> what should I do? what tool to use?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-21T15:02:54] <vkrot> gudron: , have you checked this [<-LINK->] ?
2 [2016-11-21T15:05:33] <gudron> hm...
3 [2016-11-21T15:05:58] <gudron> i must do it on every host?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-21T18:34:59] <killerspaz> krzysztof-magosa: @sirrolandif you want/bin/shto be your interpreter just supply CMD as a quoted array as you have; see: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-21T18:38:18] <dragon788> sirroland: you'll probably need to put those two commands in a single  .sh file and execute it via cmd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-21T18:46:13] <marcfielding1> Lol I was just coming to ask about networking between containes@vkrotSo basically you create a "network" on the host and then assign that as the interface for any container that needs to interact with others - I have a node API, a MySQL container and a Sphinx container that need to communicate ideally by name, this provides that functionality?
2 [2016-11-21T18:47:42] <marcfielding1> Ahh so it does, thats nifty!
3 [2016-11-21T18:56:59] <marcfielding1> @sirroland I think you simply need && after the first start so [<-CODE->] CMD executes a single command so by using && you get it to do both - at least thats my understanding
4 [2016-11-21T18:57:13] <marcfielding1> although ideally as has already been mentioned a shell script would be a good idea
5 [2016-11-21T21:12:13] <killerspaz> Also, docker compose does all that for you out of the box
6 [2016-11-21T21:14:40] <killerspaz> Skhoshhal: you need to start the Docker VM.... it should have told you also to rundocker-machine start default... then follow outputs from there.

1 [2016-11-22T07:14:12] <gudron> hi guys.
2 [2016-11-22T07:15:15] <gudron> Anyone know what to do with this problem?
3 [2016-11-22T07:15:53] <gudron> blockquoteWARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.To deploy your application across the swarm, use the bundle feature of the Docker experimental build.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-22T07:16:54] <krishnaghatti_twitter> gudron: i think docker-compose is not yet compatible with the new swarm-mode
2 [2016-11-22T07:17:14] <krishnaghatti_twitter> Swarm mode is not supported by compose yet. Compose basically does a run on the containers in your compose file. In swarm mode run only schedules containers on the daemon to which your client is connected.
3 [2016-11-22T07:18:09] <krishnaghatti_twitter> the doc [<-LINK->] says it will work but there are a lot of issues posted on github for issues around it
4 [2016-11-22T07:18:23] <gudron> oh...
5 [2016-11-22T07:20:06] <gudron> so .. how do I run a container? from the command line?
6 [2016-11-22T07:20:36] <gudron> big list of ENV variables...
7 [2016-11-22T07:20:46] <krishnaghatti_twitter> gudron: just one container or do you have a compose file?
8 [2016-11-22T07:20:54] <gudron> 6
9 [2016-11-22T07:21:11] <gudron> 2 on node-1
10 [2016-11-22T07:21:16] <gudron> 4 on node-2
11 [2016-11-22T07:21:41] <krishnaghatti_twitter> you can put all the ENV in a ‘.env’ file and pass it with -e
12 [2016-11-22T07:22:10] <gudron> indocker service create?
13 [2016-11-22T07:23:32] <krishnaghatti_twitter> sorry not with -e …it is env_file parameter
14 [2016-11-22T07:23:57] <krishnaghatti_twitter>  [<-LINK->]
15 [2016-11-22T07:24:20] <krishnaghatti_twitter> compse will not schedule across nodes…it will bring up all the nodes  in one box
16 [2016-11-22T07:25:39] <gudron> docker service create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]-e, --env value                      Set environment variables (default [])
17 [2016-11-22T07:26:01] <gudron> ok..without docker-compose.
18 [2016-11-22T07:26:46] <gudron> how to manage the containers on the hosts?
19 [2016-11-22T07:26:46] <krishnaghatti_twitter> looks like docker service does not hava a env_file param...
20 [2016-11-22T07:27:26] <gudron> facepalm ?)))
21 [2016-11-22T07:28:35] <krishnaghatti_twitter> :)
22 [2016-11-22T07:29:03] <krishnaghatti_twitter> not sure why the env_file is not supported…more than half of mesos deployments use the env_file parameter..
23 [2016-11-22T07:31:41] <gudron>  [<-LINK->]
24 [2016-11-22T07:32:20] <gudron> It recommends the use of bundles.
25 [2016-11-22T07:33:05] <gudron> but there is no support - volume mounts
26 [2016-11-22T07:33:12] <gudron> facepalm ?))
27 [2016-11-22T07:35:11] <gudron> ok ... how can I run the containers in multiple hosts on the same network. And use ENV_FILE and mount volumes?
28 [2016-11-22T11:32:58] <krishnaghatti_twitter> Skhoshhal: lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 [2016-11-22T19:20:15] <aaronmcadam> Thanks@Speechkey_twitter, does that support using files?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-23T00:17:33] <dragon788> files are not a great pattern unless they are encrypted in transit and at rest

3 [2016-11-23T08:45:30] <ShurikAg> Somehow, when I change permissions once, it’s kept on my local docker but not on AWS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-23T18:08:05] <lucasjahn> ShurikAg: I have a really similar file permission issue. So upvote for any helpful tipp on this :)
2 [2016-11-23T19:15:11] <thebuccaneersden> dragon788:
3 [2016-11-25T12:49:56] <lucasjahn> you should use the --expose option for this
4 [2016-11-25T12:50:33] <lucasjahn>  [<-CODE->]
5 [2016-11-25T12:51:38] <lucasjahn> have a look at the commandline  reference here [<-LINK->] or directly in the nginx image docs [<-LINK->] in the section exposing ports, there you have a direct example
6 [2016-11-25T12:52:04] <lucasjahn>  [<-CODE->] this would map your local port 8080 to the port 80 in the container
7 [2016-11-25T13:47:14] <lucasjahn> you set NGINX_PORT=8080
8 [2016-11-25T13:47:18] <lucasjahn> so you should adjust
9 [2016-11-25T13:47:25] <lucasjahn> -p 8080:8080
10 [2016-11-25T13:47:28] <lucasjahn> to this
11 [2016-11-25T13:47:50] <lucasjahn> can you just paste in your error again in here?
12 [2016-11-25T15:02:10] <lucasjahn> and what happens if you just run it like@matrixbotsaid?
13 [2016-11-25T15:02:16] <lucasjahn> still the error?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-23T18:17:45] <dragon788> I'd suggest checking this out, since running as root is definitely an anti-pattern that should be avoided, [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-23T23:24:22] <zapcode> can i use docker in a virtualbox ?
2 [2016-11-23T23:24:35] <MadMub> yes
3 [2016-11-23T23:24:43] <MadMub> just be careful with docker and vagrant
4 [2016-11-23T23:24:57] <MadMub> docker inside a vm through vagrant gets effed
5 [2016-11-23T23:25:11] <zapcode> some link about this ?
6 [2016-11-23T23:25:25] <MadMub> about vagrant?
7 [2016-11-23T23:25:29] <MadMub> Or docker in a vm?
8 [2016-11-23T23:25:46] <zapcode> about docker run in vbox
9 [2016-11-23T23:25:55] <MadMub> just install and use normally
10 [2016-11-23T23:26:06] <MadMub> docker can basically inside anything with a linux kernel
11 [2016-11-23T23:26:27] <MadMub> docker on windows used to be docker through a linux vm
12 [2016-11-23T23:26:48] <MadMub> docker on amazon ecs is docker running on a vm
13 [2016-11-23T23:27:12] <zapcode> yes, i install in my windows but the problem is activate hyper and break the virtualbox
14 [2016-11-23T23:27:17] <MadMub> haha
15 [2016-11-23T23:27:18] <MadMub> yes
16 [2016-11-23T23:27:27] <MadMub> a host operating system can only have 1 hypervisor
17 [2016-11-23T23:27:36] <zapcode> i write a command that i can select in the booting if activate/desactivate hyper
18 [2016-11-23T23:27:47] <zapcode> but the docker not run if i need vbox
19 [2016-11-23T23:27:56] <zapcode> and vbox no run if i select hyper and no like this
20 [2016-11-23T23:28:14] <zapcode> i need can use the two without reboot
21 [2016-11-23T23:28:16] <MadMub> on windows, you cannot run both hyper and vbox
22 [2016-11-23T23:28:22] <MadMub> on any os
23 [2016-11-23T23:28:30] <MadMub> you cant run competing hypervisors
24 [2016-11-23T23:28:36] <MadMub> to me knowledge at least
25 [2016-11-23T23:29:13] <MadMub> if you have hyperv just use that it can do everything vbox does

13 [2016-11-25T15:35:01] <scippio> lucasjahn: no.. it\'s ok. but I need --network "host" option ... so I must build my own image from nginx:alpine ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-25T14:11:41] <matrixbot> uhoregAre you sure the image you\'re using supports NGINX_PORT?  Don\'t use \'--network "host"\'.  Just do "docker run -p 8080:80 nginx"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-25T17:14:52] <Benjman> Sorry if this is the wrong channel, but can anyone tell me where I might see the log output for an AWS ECS container I'm trying to start a docker container on? I think it's failing, but I have no idea where to see if it is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-25T17:21:02] <Forecaster> Might be a better place, but I'm having issues getting php-fpm and nginx working (in separate containers), I'm getting a bad gateway and I think it might be because nginx can't communicate with php properly, but I'm not sure why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-25T18:15:15] <DylanNWatt> Hey guys, realtively new to docker, helping my company (who doesn't currently use docker) move on to it. I have a best practices question. Should starting a process be part of the Dockerfile, or the responsibility of the container manager. EG, given an node app, shouldnpm startbe called in the dockerfile, or in docker-compose?
2 [2016-11-25T18:16:44] <MadMub> dockerfile
3 [2016-11-25T18:16:50] <MadMub> set it as CMD
4 [2016-11-25T18:17:05] <MadMub> 1 process per container
5 [2016-11-25T18:17:41] <MadMub> I myself am no docker expert only containerized basic applications though, others jump in and correct me
6 [2016-11-25T18:18:57] <Forecaster> dockerfile
7 [2016-11-25T18:19:50] <MadMub> official nodejs docs have a basic tut
8 [2016-11-25T18:19:51] <MadMub>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-25T18:20:43] <DylanNWatt> As an extension of that, how does that work with local development? For example, I currently build the dockerfile by linking in some relatively pathed code. But then in docker compose, I want to link in code as a volume, so that changes are live.
2 [2016-11-25T18:21:05] <DylanNWatt> Linking in that colume sort of messes up the runtime, though, IE I need to rerunnpm installbeforenpm startworks.
3 [2016-11-25T18:21:16] <DylanNWatt> Would it just be a separate dockerfile for development?
4 [2016-11-25T18:21:35] <MadMub> I cant speak to any of that, I’ve never really found success for docker in dev, not a docker pro yet
5 [2016-11-25T18:22:38] <DylanNWatt> Thanks for the link though. It definitely makes sense that the process should be started from the Dockerfile, I'm jusyt trying to figure out how to make local development seemless in a docker world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-26T11:55:53] <ilgooz> is it possible to auto pull volumes from registry while doing docker service create? do i have to manually ssh into all swarm nodes and do a pull of my volume(container) each time a new version is ready?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-26T14:19:15] <nischay30> Jst try docker service update

1 [2016-11-26T14:26:27] <gadget_mnky_twitter> Looking to scale a bunch of compose files across hosts but swarm minus bundle seems like a pain

1 [2016-11-27T11:48:30] <lucasjahn> Hey there, can anyone help me with an cron issue. I have a PHP container in which I need to run cron (for wordpress, because the wordpress cron is not running)
2 [2016-11-27T11:48:54] <lucasjahn> I created a cron with supervisord and the service is running in the container
3 [2016-11-27T11:49:10] <lucasjahn> but the crontab (which is also available in the container) is never starting or running
4 [2016-11-27T11:50:35] <lucasjahn> in the dockerfile: [<-CODE->] cron tab file [<-CODE->] in the container: [<-CODE->] and the supervisor d: [<-CODE->]
5 [2016-11-27T11:50:52] <lucasjahn> and the /tmp/test is never created its weird

1 [2016-11-27T15:44:51] <ImFlog> Hello, I have an issue with swarm. I have a simple java application which tries to call another application. I use swarm for my deployment through a network overlay. The problem is that when I scale an app, I can validate that the hosts behind the VIP are updated but my client keeps calling the same addresses.I tried a lot of things like changing java DNS cache ttlAnyone ever had something like that ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T02:43:03] <gadget_mnky_twitter> Hi, looking to scale my existing compose file across multiple hosts using swarm. Any examples I could follow?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T10:10:44] <ninabreznik> heyho, one stupid question, but i really don't know how to solve this
2 [2016-11-28T10:11:15] <ninabreznik> so, i dockerized the app and pushed it to docker hub and my computer crashed so i would need to get the source code back from the docker image
3 [2016-11-28T10:11:44] <ninabreznik> i pulled it now from the docker hub, but i have the image...how do i get to the code?
4 [2016-11-28T10:11:51] <ninabreznik> thanks a lot for help :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T10:14:08] <Forecaster> ninabreznik: you mean the files for your app?
2 [2016-11-28T10:14:16] <ninabreznik> yes
3 [2016-11-28T10:14:29] <ninabreznik> i have a rails app and want to get to it :)
4 [2016-11-28T10:14:46] <Forecaster> you can run it as a container and use 'docker cp' to copy files out of it
5 [2016-11-28T10:15:34] <Forecaster> likedocker cp imageid:/path/on/image /path/on/host
6 [2016-11-28T10:15:54] <ninabreznik> huh, i forgot a bit how to do it. will try to refresh my memory and see how to run it and then how to do that, but ok, it's doable. yay
7 [2016-11-28T10:16:45] <Forecaster> you can copy entire directories at once by just pointing it at a dir
8 [2016-11-28T10:17:10] <ninabreznik> how do i run it again? docker run imageID... ?
9 [2016-11-28T10:17:42] <Forecaster> you probably want to dodocker run -d image
10 [2016-11-28T10:18:07] <Forecaster> that will not attach to it, it will just run it in the background
11 [2016-11-28T10:18:23] <ninabreznik> ok, did that
12 [2016-11-28T10:18:28] <ninabreznik> and now i do the cp thing?
13 [2016-11-28T10:18:35] <Forecaster> yep
14 [2016-11-28T10:18:54] <ninabreznik> what do i use as path/on/image?
15 [2016-11-28T10:19:14] <Forecaster> "image" should be "container"
16 [2016-11-28T10:19:21] <Forecaster> but the path to where your files are stored
17 [2016-11-28T10:20:26] <ninabreznik> ok, lemme check my cheatsheets :D
18 [2016-11-28T10:20:31] <ninabreznik> muchas gracias for this
19 [2016-11-28T10:20:40] <Forecaster> no problem
20 [2016-11-28T10:27:16] <ninabreznik> Forecaster: If i run docker inspect containerID, I get this [<-CODE->]
21 [2016-11-28T10:27:49] <Forecaster> okay?
22 [2016-11-28T10:27:55] <ninabreznik> do i find path here?
23 [2016-11-28T10:28:15] <ninabreznik> i don't know how to find image path and host path that you mentioned?
24 [2016-11-28T10:28:34] <Forecaster> you misunderstood me then
25 [2016-11-28T10:28:39] <ninabreznik> i did this like a year ago and since that didn't touch docker, so I forgot everything :D
26 [2016-11-28T10:29:31] <Forecaster> docker cp containerId:/path/to/source/in/container /output/path/on/host
27 [2016-11-28T10:30:05] <Forecaster> ninabreznik: hopefully that is more clear
28 [2016-11-28T10:31:56] <ninabreznik> So, I bash into my container and find a path to my app and then path/on/host means where on my comp i want to save it?
29 [2016-11-28T10:32:05] <Forecaster> yes
30 [2016-11-28T10:32:11] <ninabreznik> oh yeah, let's see
31 [2016-11-28T10:43:35] <ninabreznik> ole
32 [2016-11-28T10:43:46] <ninabreznik> have it! owe you a beer or carrot juice :)
33 [2016-11-28T10:43:55] <ninabreznik> thanks again
34 [2016-11-28T10:43:56] <Forecaster> nice :)
35 [2016-11-28T10:44:14] <ninabreznik> now off to play ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T12:48:20] <jacobcamm> hey guys, running a docker exec cmd to a remote host and the output just stops showing? The process still seems to be running in the container on the remote host but there's no more stdout displayed on my machine? Is there a timeout or anything of the sort for that, or any reason it would stop?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T16:06:12] <mikewrighton> hi! does anyone happen to know about inspecting execution state in a container? when youexeca command you can see the exec id in the container state, and the docker API allows you to query that state (e.g. to see whether it’s running) but I don’t see any docs for command line support
2 [2016-11-28T16:06:45] <mikewrighton> in other words, my question is can you do this in the CLI tool: [<-LINK->]
3 [2016-11-28T17:15:04] <Forecaster> mikewrighton: you mean this? [<-LINK->]
4 [2016-11-28T17:16:32] <mikewrighton> so I can rundocker inspectto get the list of current exec ids for a container, but I can’t seem to actually inspect the execution state for those exec ids
5 [2016-11-28T17:18:18] <mikewrighton> I tried runningdocker inspect<exec id> but gotError: No such image, container or task:<exec id>
6 [2016-11-28T17:19:03] <mikewrighton> unless I’m missing something, it seems like this is not implemented for the CLI tool?
7 [2016-11-28T17:20:37] <Forecaster> maybe if you request the data as json from the container?
8 [2016-11-28T17:23:20] <mikewrighton> oh, how can I try that?
9 [2016-11-28T17:29:04] <Forecaster> oh, the default format is json it appears
10 [2016-11-28T17:29:44] <Forecaster> if that doesn't contain it then you may be stuck with the api
11 [2016-11-28T17:35:40] <mikewrighton> yeah it looks like it, thanks anyway.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T21:13:43] <killerspaz> mikewrighton: which OS? If on linux, you needsudo... otherwise, ensure the container exists withdocker ps -a
2 [2016-11-28T21:14:34] <mikewrighton> the docker docs don’t even claim to support this
3 [2016-11-28T21:14:48] <mikewrighton> but I can get what I need from the remote API viacurl
4 [2016-11-28T21:15:07] <mikewrighton> like this:curl -XGET --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost:3475/exec/$id/json
5 [2016-11-28T21:18:03] <mikewrighton> (on osx)
6 [2016-11-28T21:24:18] <killerspaz> Use inspect as suggested by@Forecaster....docker inspect <id>
7 [2016-11-28T21:25:01] <mikewrighton> I getError: No such image, container or task: a9952be2c74f2c6f3a7ae9faf12dc1576367bba5197fe74c243b637289fb653b
8 [2016-11-28T21:25:16] <mikewrighton> but an exec id is not an image, container or task
9 [2016-11-28T21:26:05] <mikewrighton> so docker inspect, as far as I can tell, does not support quering exec ids
10 [2016-11-28T22:51:21] <killerspaz> ah, i misunderstood your use-case... i didn't realize you were looking at stats for an exec... i do not know about that one
11 [2016-11-29T16:13:10] <killerspaz> my guess would be to isolate docker traffic routes to only work on the bridged network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-28T22:53:10] <dragon788> mikewrighton: I think you are correct, inspect is mostly for containers and images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2016-11-30T15:11:51] <jdevillard> Hello, I'm new on docker, I would like to know if there is some UI and/or orchestrator that allow me to manage multiple cluster in one place. I understand that there is many Docker UI available but it seems that it allows to manage only one cluster (or maybe I miss something). Indeed my cluster will be hosted on Azure, in different Vnet and I would like a single interface to manage them all. Do you have any idea?
2 [2016-11-30T15:25:30] <jdevillard> interesting thanks@marcelmfs!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-30T15:24:18] <marcelmfs> check rancher.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-11-30T20:07:03] <dragon788> rightisleft: I believe the new version is Docker Toolbox which may use the native hypervisor in OSX, but not sure if that\'s fully released, otherwise docker-machine should natively use the "best" option per platform

1 [2016-12-01T19:04:09] <picturejess> im trying to attach a dynamic env variable to my docker container and I am a bit stuck. any ideas on how I can do something similar to this:docker run  -e TEMP_VAR=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep "nameserver" | awk \'{print $2}\' | tr \'\\n\' \' \')
2 [2016-12-02T14:01:23] <picturejess> any ideas on my issue above?
3 [2016-12-02T14:11:20] <picturejess> I want to get the value of nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf at the time the container is spun up. the value may be different on different systemsm
4 [2016-12-02T14:18:30] <dragon788> you could map the /etc/resolv.conf from the host into the container as a specific file (probably not /etc/resolv.conf) and then run your eval inside the container as part of the CMD
5 [2016-12-02T14:19:15] <dragon788> or follow the Docker docs and do map it in, [<-LINK->]
6 [2016-12-02T14:20:02] <dragon788> per that doc, mapping the file should be last resort, "The exact details of how Docker maintains these files inside the container can change from one Docker version to the next, so you should leave the files themselves alone and use the following Docker options instead."
7 [2016-12-02T14:29:38] <picturejess> ill try that out, thanks!
8 [2016-12-02T15:16:04] <dragon788> sadly I'm doing most of my work on Windows these days, so haven't been able to play with the more recent Docker releases

1 [2016-12-01T23:55:31] <danieldram> Is there a way to get the original IP from the request client inside a node express app? It is always 10.0.0.22 for me
2 [2016-12-02T00:03:30] <danieldram> the node app runs in a container this is why I can't get the remote address
3 [2016-12-02T00:37:56] <dragon788> danieldram: you probably want to have a proxy pass the original IP as an additional X-header
4 [2016-12-02T02:59:21] <danieldram> dragon788: thanks for the reply! Are there docs available for this? I've been looking everywhere online for a solution :S
5 [2016-12-02T04:22:09] <dragon788> Do you have nginx or some other proxy in front? Typically you just set up your original page to pass that header when a request comes through it
6 [2016-12-02T14:09:41] <dragon788> picturejess: you could try usinginstead of $( as in my experience from using it in scripts, theevaluates every time while $( stores the value immediately and doesn't re-evaluate when called again
7 [2016-12-02T14:10:19] <dragon788> what is the end goal of your script/variable? there might be a better way using etcd or something
8 [2016-12-02T14:56:33] <dragon788> dearfrankg: I think if you search back in this channel I posted a link about how to run containers by default as a non-root local user, otherwise if I can find time I'll see if I can pull it up again
9 [2016-12-02T14:57:14] <dragon788> I think there is either a umask or uid that you can pass to the volume command to mount/present it as a different user inside, but the link addressed most of that

Is there a fix for this?
2 [2016-12-02T14:57:20] <dearfrankg> dragon788: I can run as non-root now.  my problem is accessing the volume.  Do you address that issue?
3 [2016-12-02T14:58:03] <dearfrankg> dragon788: I'm curious about your post -- I will hunt for it
4 [2016-12-02T14:59:12] <dearfrankg> dragon788: funny.  I just read that blog post.  That's how I learned to run as a non-root user.  But I cannot access the host volume.
5 [2016-12-02T15:02:17] <dearfrankg> dragon788: I see your umask point - still digging
6 [2016-12-02T15:12:20] <dearfrankg> dragon788: are you able to use host volumes with a non-root user running the container?

1 [2016-12-05T10:18:10] <christhomas> hey guys, so I am wondering how you all manage your docker compose definitions, say I have an api, built in a microservice architecture, it results in something like 50+ docker compose services and I am wondering, if there is a better way to setup all these services using tools instead of hardcoded yml files on disk
2 [2016-12-05T10:19:56] <christhomas> I guess a nicer way would be through some interface, where I can build the configurations and house them in a tool which I could run, store them in a backend database, then I could manage them easier, any tools which you guys run that would help? or do you run everything using docker run? I guess not, cause multi service architectures would be a bit tricky to manage
3 [2016-12-05T11:37:57] <Forecaster> I use Rancher
4 [2016-12-05T11:46:24] <christhomas> ok, thats a good answer, thanks
5 [2016-12-05T14:15:45] <christhomas> CORS is not a docker problem, its a PHP/Javascript/Cross Origin Resource Sharing problem, you should go to ask in one of the other related channels
6 [2016-12-05T14:16:13] <christhomas> if you can execute php and it works and your problem is something in that code, then this isnt really the place to ask that, try a PHP / JS channel
7 [2016-12-05T14:17:27] <LuizTibo> Thanks@christhomas

1 [2016-12-05T11:48:25] <christhomas> ok, I have another question, I am trying to do some port forwarding and for some reason it doesnt work.in my docker-compose service, I have ports: - "10001:9001" and inside my container, I run a simple php script to listen on port 9001 and output when a connection is made.if I shell into the container and do a curl 127.0.0.1:9001 it says connection successfulif I try to do that curl command outside the container like: curl 127.0.0.1:10001, it doesnt get any reply, even though I assumed it would forward the port 10001->9001any ideas?
2 [2016-12-05T11:50:04] <christhomas> if I use my host computers ip address, or the containers ip address, both dont work, I just get an empty response, it only works from inside the container, so its like I have forwarded the port, but I need to expose it as well?
3 [2016-12-05T11:57:53] <christhomas> ok, I just tried something random, seems that binding to ip address 0.0.0.0 makes it available externally, but 127.0.0.1 does not

1 [2016-12-05T13:13:30] <LuizTibo> Hello guys, I have problems with my docker.... I have a docker-compose with nginx, php-fpm and postgres. It's works, but my page don't loading completly. A think it could be something like 'CORS'. I think that the AJAX requests don't work. Anybody Know how can i resolve this problem?
2 [2016-12-05T15:10:04] <LuizTibo> christhomas: I can to make it work with php5, the problem was the php version. But I could not find the php error log in my container, I did a test with php5 and it worked

1 [2016-12-05T14:38:25] <skvoz> Hello , anybody know how install and work with supervisor in docker container ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-05T18:42:50] <renegoretzka> Hello.. anyone using caddy with docker?
2 [2016-12-05T18:50:17] <renegoretzka> is it usually to install like mysql and wordpress in the same docker? so i have separated every database and wordpress for each website? i shall i use one database docker for more as one website?
3 [2016-12-05T18:54:59] <dragon788> renegoretzka: typically Docker is designed to be used as a microservices style infrastructure, basically one service/responsibility per container
4 [2016-12-05T18:55:29] <renegoretzka> okay.. but should i separated the db container for multiple sites?
5 [2016-12-05T18:55:29] <dragon788> you can use something like Docker-Compose to link between them, which allows you to upgrade MySQL without reconfiguring and reinstalling your Wordpress
6 [2016-12-05T18:55:58] <dragon788> ahh, you may want to have separate databases, but you could probably do one DB container for a few sites depending on the performance requirements
7 [2016-12-05T18:56:10] <renegoretzka> ahh
8 [2016-12-05T18:56:15] <renegoretzka> so thats no really big prob
9 [2016-12-05T18:56:34] <renegoretzka> thanks bro
10 [2016-12-05T18:56:43] <renegoretzka> i think you helped me already :)
11 [2016-12-05T18:56:53] <renegoretzka> docker++
12 [2016-12-05T18:56:56] <dragon788> yeah, depends if you want each developer/site owner to be able to run it locally or just have one database instance for a hosting site
13 [2016-12-05T18:57:12] <renegoretzka> i host all the websites
14 [2016-12-05T18:58:45] <renegoretzka>  [<-CODE->]
15 [2016-12-05T18:58:54] <renegoretzka> i think this will just run very good
16 [2016-12-05T18:59:56] <renegoretzka> i can add a volume to my wordpress to load my wordpress files from my host volume where i save all my stuff.. how to do the volume to it?
17 [2016-12-05T19:05:15] <renegoretzka> dragon788: you know what i mean?
18 [2016-12-05T19:15:08] <renegoretzka> okay, but does it overwrite the wordpress php-files in the container with my files from my host?
19 [2016-12-05T19:15:36] <dragon788> if you specify a path that "conflicts" I believe the mapped ones will always overwrite/win
20 [2016-12-05T19:15:50] <renegoretzka> okay great i will try that :)
21 [2016-12-05T19:16:02] <renegoretzka> thank you very much@dragon788
22 [2016-12-05T21:01:35] <dragon788> yeah, it's your foldername as the prefix and then the containername

2 [2016-12-06T07:09:34] <skvoz> ketchupmonkey: very long question , you want started some container with different application ?
3 [2016-12-06T07:59:30] <skvoz> ketchupmonkey: look at docker-compose you can use many options for comunicate between container and user
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-05T20:12:24] <renegoretzka> how do i set a specific name to a service instead of dockerfiles_service_1?

1 [2016-12-06T06:23:18] <ketchupmonkey> hi i was wondering if you all could help me I am working at a apache environment and I am planning on moving all the web applications(and they are a lot) to docker but I was wondering how will I be able to let all containers run at the same time since most of them will be using port 80 and 443. So far the only idea i have is should i just assign each container a random port number(e.g 81 for one and the next one will be 82 and etc.) which translates it to 80 & 443 and run a reverse proxy to point to those random port numbers for each or is there a better solution?
2 [2016-12-06T07:02:36] <ketchupmonkey> any help plz?
3 [2016-12-06T07:31:27] <ketchupmonkey> skvoz: : Thanks for replying. sorry for the long question. basically i have a bunch of web apps and i want to dockerize them but i am just concerned coz all of them will be using port 80 and 443 which may cause some port conflicts any way I could approach this?
4 [2016-12-06T08:08:43] <ketchupmonkey> but if i deploy several containers exposing ports 80 & 443 wouldn't there be a conflict?
5 [2016-12-06T08:11:19] <Forecaster> yes
6 [2016-12-06T08:11:59] <ketchupmonkey> how can I deploy several dockerized web applications that each use port 80 & 443 in one host?
7 [2016-12-06T08:12:25] <Forecaster> you can't
8 [2016-12-06T08:12:34] <Forecaster> you have to use different ports
9 [2016-12-06T08:14:00] <ketchupmonkey> oh cool
10 [2016-12-06T08:14:15] <ketchupmonkey> so you just need to take note of what port you assigned to which container then
11 [2016-12-06T08:15:04] <ketchupmonkey> can apache do to redirects too? I know that sounds like a silly question but I am more familiar doing redirects with nginx than with apache. I'm just not sure about the performance
12 [2016-12-06T08:15:32] <ketchupmonkey> sweet thanks@duaneleem@Forecaster@skvoz
13 [2016-12-06T08:16:11] <Forecaster> doing proxy passes is awful in apache
14 [2016-12-06T08:16:17] <Forecaster> such a config nightmare
15 [2016-12-06T08:16:39] <Forecaster> I've tried and never gotten it to work correctly
16 [2016-12-06T08:16:45] <ketchupmonkey> oh really? damn. the environment I'm managing is mainly using apache.
17 [2016-12-06T08:17:02] <Forecaster> it should be possible, but finding out how is hard
18 [2016-12-06T08:17:30] <ketchupmonkey> cool. Oh well i guess back to googling then
19 [2016-12-06T08:18:16] <ketchupmonkey> Thank you so much guys
20 [2016-12-06T08:18:41] <duaneleem> hope that was helpful, np
21 [2016-12-06T09:38:32] <ketchupmonkey> sebmoule: : wow i didn't know there was something that could do that. Thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-06T08:13:43] <duaneleem> I use different ports, and use nginx to proxy pass to each of the docker web apps (each have their own port)
2 [2016-12-06T08:14:33] <duaneleem> yea, you can see which ports are taken when you "docker ps" under ports
3 [2016-12-06T08:15:09] <duaneleem> u can run each docker web application "docker run -p 8080:80"
4 [2016-12-06T08:15:46] <duaneleem> oh haven't tried it with apache for proxy pass
5 [2016-12-06T08:16:23] <duaneleem> screw that haha

1 [2016-12-06T09:15:40] <ely029> I created a docker-compose.yml filehere is the code `frontend:  image: ubuntu:14.04web:  build: .  command: apt-get update  command: apt-get install php7.0  command: apt-get install apache2  command: apt-get install subversion  volumes: [<-CODE->] ports: [<-CODE->] links: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Is there something wrong in my yml file?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-06T09:17:17] <sebmoule> ketchupmonkey: you can give a look at Traefik proxy which allows you to configure dynamically your proxy just specifying some docker labels.

1 [2016-12-07T04:43:17] <siassaj> ave
2 [2016-12-07T04:44:31] <siassaj> I am curious, when I want to deploy an image that I've built locally is it possible (or even plausible) to upload only that top application layer that's changed, and let my machines fetch the lower layers from cache?
3 [2016-12-07T07:00:24] <siassaj> Lakshman-LD: ok, that makes sense. So i think maybe I need a server on the same network/data centre as my app servers that will pull from github, build the image then deploy (meaning only the shared layers get sent to the app servers)
4 [2016-12-07T07:00:38] <siassaj> so probably time to go figure out how to do that, thank you :)
5 [2016-12-07T07:09:50] <lakshmantgld> :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-07T05:05:01] <lakshmantgld> siassaj: I think trhe layers are introduced for reducing the payload during the uploads. So, the layers are automatically recognized and only those layers that are changed, will be sent as payload.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-07T17:44:41] <dragon788> you can either try to export the container and layers with tar, or you could use the built in MySQL command line to create a backup, or you could add something like PHPMyAdmin to administer the MySQL from a web server container, been a while since I've done any of that though
2 [2016-12-07T17:47:00] <dragon788> there should be a mysql restore command that you can use to import the export
3 [2016-12-07T17:47:20] <dragon788> I'd check [<-LINK->] , I'd wager it's a common query

1 [2016-12-07T19:20:33] <Trezamere> If I've got a docker container running docker (teamcity agent running builds) what is the best way to mount a volume in the 'parent' container into the 'child' container?
2 [2016-12-07T19:22:25] <Trezamere> The 'parent' container has the host docker socket bound (-v /var/run/docker.sock:) so when the agent (parent container) tries to run a new container and pass some -v flags; the -v flags don't get mounted correctly as far as I can tell
3 [2016-12-07T19:27:55] <Trezamere> presumably because it's not actually a child; but a sibling; and the directory trying to be mounted doesn't actually exist outside the 'parent'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-07T20:36:48] <dragon788> Trezamere: I haven\'t actually messed with volumes in that manner, but have you tried using "volumes_from" by creating a sibling of the parent container that maps in the volumes from the host you want to use and then having the spun up agents using  volumes_from?
2 [2016-12-07T21:09:28] <dragon788> hmmm, you could probably mount the socket, though you might need to run the container with--privilegedto do so, any particular reason?

12 [2016-12-07T21:13:52] <dragon788> is it a user/network restriction that hasn\'t been "GRANT"ed access in the database?@renegoretzka

14 [2016-12-07T21:14:30] <renegoretzka> i can access my sql by phpmyadmin

17 [2016-12-07T21:18:36] <dragon788> hmmm, and you provided a grant towordpresswith the password you specified?
18 [2016-12-07T21:18:56] <dragon788> I'd check the tables and make sure the permissions are present
19 [2016-12-07T21:19:40] <renegoretzka> but wouldnt phpmyadmin not run?
20 [2016-12-07T21:21:43] <dragon788> the way it is set up I think phpmyadmin isn't using a username and password to login, so it may be accessing via root permissions
21 [2016-12-07T21:22:33] <renegoretzka> hmm
22 [2016-12-07T21:26:40] <renegoretzka> its because of php7.0-fpm@dragon788

25 [2016-12-07T21:35:58] <renegoretzka> dragon788: you have an idea?
26 [2016-12-07T21:36:07] <renegoretzka> its because of fpm i guess
27 [2016-12-07T22:44:41] <renegoretzka> dragon788: i really have big probs
28 [2016-12-07T22:44:46] <renegoretzka> i cant start my shit
29 [2016-12-07T22:44:57] <renegoretzka> i just wanted to move my domain to my new server with docker
30 [2016-12-07T22:45:05] <renegoretzka> but now nothing works
31 [2016-12-07T22:45:08] <renegoretzka> i get to many error

1 [2016-12-07T20:54:49] <sbbowers__twitter> Hello, is it possible to mount the mysql socket file directly into a docker container?
2 [2016-12-07T20:58:09] <sbbowers__twitter> Or basically any method that would allow me to connect to a vanilla mysql server running on the host.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-07T22:43:27] <dragon788> I don't, I haven't messed with PHP in ages, I'd file an issue against their repository and see if you can replicate it outside of Docker
2 [2016-12-07T22:47:31] <dragon788> hmmm, no idea on that one, you should make sure you have your new Docker hosting secured with a secure SSH key and avoid using passwords as much as possible
3 [2016-12-07T22:48:15] <renegoretzka> i dont have any passwords
4 [2016-12-07T22:50:00] <renegoretzka> why does my container have an unique id when i run the container in front of the name??
5 [2016-12-07T22:51:50] <dragon788> every "instance" of a container is a unique run, this allows you to scale up to 3x web containers in front of 1x DB container without doing too much extra work
6 [2016-12-07T22:52:17] <renegoretzka> but the container name is unique!
7 [2016-12-07T22:53:11] <dragon788> when you rundocker psit is different than the one you ran it with? or running it withdocker-compose ps?
8 [2016-12-07T22:54:20] <renegoretzka> yes its different
9 [2016-12-07T22:54:30] <renegoretzka> docker-compose is correct
10 [2016-12-07T22:54:49] <renegoretzka> but cant kill the container
11 [2016-12-07T22:56:24] <renegoretzka> dragon788: any idea??
12 [2016-12-07T23:00:59] <dragon788> you probably need todocker-compose stopthendocker-compose killin the directory where yourdocker-compose.ymlis located
13 [2016-12-07T23:01:52] <dragon788> you can also usedocker killto kill the container if you get its ID viadocker ps, a handy shortcut is you only need enough characters to have it be unique, I've found 4-6 usually does it

1 [2016-12-08T14:15:12] <ssharpjr> New to resin.io.  I have a series of RPI devices running in a production environment.  Each has the same code but they each have a unique identifier that is used in an API call to get data specific to what that device is connected to.  I need to deploy new devices with their unique identifier preset.  Is this possible?  Also, can I preset a device name instead of getting a random name generated?  Thanks in advance.
2 [2016-12-08T14:15:36] <ssharpjr> Err, wrong chat, sorry
3 [2016-12-08T19:28:48] <dragon788> sbbowers__twitter: is that a function of a certain version of the docker-engine as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-08T19:16:39] <sbbowers__twitter> hello, I'm trying to define static IP addresses in my IPAM config using the aux_addresses key. My hosts don't get the IP addresses in this dictionary. Is there a trick to it? I'm just specifying host: ipaddress in the aux_addresses dictionary
2 [2016-12-08T19:18:03] <sbbowers__twitter> matching the host keys in the aux_addresses dictionary to the keys in my services dictionary.
3 [2016-12-08T19:23:14] <sbbowers__twitter> looks like I have docker-compose version 1.8.1 Thats what pip pulls. do I need to upgrade or something?
4 [2016-12-08T19:27:55] <sbbowers__twitter> upgraded to 1.9.0. still not getting the IPs from aux_addresses
5 [2016-12-08T19:30:12] <sbbowers__twitter> I assume so. my docker is 1.12.3
6 [2016-12-08T19:31:09] <sbbowers__twitter> basically I'm doing this: [<-LINK->]
7 [2016-12-08T19:32:54] <sbbowers__twitter> which appears to be the latest stable. its had static IP support for quite awhile
8 [2016-12-08T19:49:42] <sbbowers__twitter> I'm missing the range.  found that it works if I specify anetworks.<network>.ipv4_addresskey on the service itself.
9 [2016-12-08T19:49:49] <sbbowers__twitter> I'll see if I can get the range to work.
10 [2016-12-08T19:50:19] <dragon788> yeah, it also sounds like you need to define the "top level" networks and then the "service level" networks, [<-LINK->]
11 [2016-12-08T19:51:00] <dragon788> weird, they have some funky documentation, [<-LINK->]
12 [2016-12-08T19:54:43] <sbbowers__twitter> thanks for some ideas. gotta run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-08T19:41:46] <dragon788> so you have the ip_range and gateway and subnet settings defined as well in the same range as your aux_ips?
2 [2016-12-08T19:46:51] <dragon788> that example is rather confusing because it defines multiple non-overlapping networks in one go
3 [2016-12-08T19:47:39] <dragon788> but I think the gist of it is that you need the range for all containers to pull from, a dhcp pool defined for dynamic hosts, and then you can set up static mappings outside of the DHCP pool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-08T19:55:16] <renegoretzka> heyo.. i get error 502 bad gateway using fpm and caddyserver

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 [2016-12-09T00:48:03] <CarlosAmaral> any clue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T10:58:01] <tsm91> hi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T11:01:02] <tsm91> i would like to dockerize a project that consist of:a frontend codebase (angular 2, after npm run build all the STATIC files i need is in the dist directory)\na backend codebase (a nodejs app w/o any transpilation build process)the production nginx.conf file looks like this: [<-CODE->] the backend api got a dependency for mongodb, so i will need a node, mongo, nginx Dockerfile
2 [2016-12-09T11:01:39] <tsm91> what i am not sure is,  to which image's filesystem should i put the frontend static files? It should be in the nginx image. Am i correct?
3 [2016-12-09T11:46:29] <kschlesselmann> If they're only needed in the frontend I'd put them there, yes. After you all you don't ship a nginx but your frontend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T11:02:50] <am0nshi> if it 100% static its better to put them into ngixn, but you can mount physical directory into both images, its depends on how you will build your containers
2 [2016-12-09T12:05:07] <am0nshi> CarlosAmaral: what do you try to do with this command?
3 [2016-12-09T13:58:04] <am0nshi> CarlosAmaral: for which purposes? it's not local docker?
4 [2016-12-09T13:59:11] <am0nshi> CarlosAmaral: thisdocker -H <IP address>similar for justdockerbut on remote host. what you suppose to be when you just rundocker -d?
5 [2016-12-09T14:03:26] <CarlosAmaral> yeah it's a docker on a vm, i dunno i was following the deep dive tut on pluralsight
6 [2016-12-09T14:05:21] <am0nshi> CarlosAmaral: -d it's demonize container, its not main, its secondary directive, which often used withdocker runcommand. in puredockerthere is no -d, only indocker run
7 [2016-12-09T14:40:31] <CarlosAmaral> oh ok got it ty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T15:53:14] <sbbowers__twitter> so docker-compose validates the yaml file and fails if there are extra keys. Is there a place to put non-validated config data that I can use as templates for other things?
2 [2016-12-09T15:53:57] <sbbowers__twitter> for instance, I have an app with many services, which are mostly the same, minus a few environment variables.
3 [2016-12-09T15:54:36] <sbbowers__twitter> i'd like to make a configuration template with all of the configuration for my apps, and then overlay the environment vars related for each service.  YAML supports this.
4 [2016-12-09T15:55:50] <sbbowers__twitter> I'm aware of environement variables. I can't put the service template inside of an environement variable inside of a service definition.
5 [2016-12-09T16:01:56] <sbbowers__twitter> This is exactly what I'm talking about. I guess its not possible. [<-ISSUE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T15:54:33] <JnMik>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T18:10:53] <JnMik> Ok so you want some common variables shared accross all the services, and then you want to specify some environment variables for each specifics ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T18:32:36] <dragon788> you might be better served writing a simple script that outputs the correct yaml for your current environment. there are so many libraries for Ruby/Python/etc to parse and output YAML, and a simple text replace wouldn't be many lines at all.

1 [2016-12-09T23:26:12] <FuzzOli87> Hello all! Maybe you guys can help me out, been beating this up all day.
2 [2016-12-09T23:26:55] <FuzzOli87> I'm trying to create a base docker image that would allow me to use volumes and have them be created with the same permission as the host. This is the base image for our containers:
3 [2016-12-09T23:27:02] <FuzzOli87>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2016-12-09T23:27:55] <FuzzOli87> This is the Dockerfile for using it in an application:
5 [2016-12-09T23:27:56] <FuzzOli87>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2016-12-09T23:28:46] <dragon788> FuzzOli87: you can see if this gives you any more clarity [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-09T23:35:58] <FuzzOli87> If I mount a dist Volume in the Dockerfile dist and run a build step it creates all the files on my host, with the correct permissions. I run it like so [<-CODE->]
2 [2016-12-09T23:36:14] <FuzzOli87> dragon788: That is where I got this whole base image idea from :D
3 [2016-12-09T23:37:04] <FuzzOli87> However, I don't want to add aVOLUME ./dist:$HOME/distto this Dockerfile bc I'm going to use it to build my final production  build
4 [2016-12-09T23:37:34] <FuzzOli87> I created a set of docker-compose.yamls that extend each other and pass in variables etc
5 [2016-12-09T23:37:35] <FuzzOli87>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2016-12-09T23:39:20] <FuzzOli87> the docker.compose.yml used the Dockerfile I used in the previous example. Yet if I try doing this: [<-CODE->]
7 [2016-12-09T23:39:33] <FuzzOli87> It generates the dist directory on my host as root. I don't understand why when I ran a similar command against the image this compose file is based from it created the dist directory with proper permission but running it like this does not.

1 [2016-12-10T08:50:04] <lucperkins> Hey y’all, I have a pretty basic question (I’m a bit of a newcomer) but I can’t seem to wrap my head around it. Let’s say that I have an HTTP server running inside of a Docker container on my laptop. I want to test it in conjunction with, say, MySQL running on my laptop. How do I enable the process running inside the container to talk to the DB? I’ve tried some approaches I saw online, like using a—add-hostflag, but to no avail.
2 [2016-12-10T08:50:55] <lucperkins> (this would be a non-containered DB)
3 [2016-12-10T18:31:00] <lucperkins> GastroGeek: Thatdoeshelp, although it turns out my problem was a stupid syntax error at the application level. Derp. Learned a bunch from that SO question, though, so thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2016-12-10T21:28:56] <Forecaster> Hm, I'm having an odd issue
2 [2016-12-10T21:29:09] <Forecaster> I'm trying to set up a php <-> nginx environment
3 [2016-12-10T21:29:29] <Forecaster> I have them in separate containers, with a link from the nginx container to the php one called "php"
4 [2016-12-10T21:30:10] <Forecaster> in the nginx config I have a fastcgi_pass to "php:9000", which fails with a bad gateway "connection refused"
5 [2016-12-10T21:30:40] <Forecaster> if I ping "php" from inside the nginx container it tells me it\'s pinging the ip 103.224.182.212
6 [2016-12-10T21:30:52] <Forecaster> but the ip of the php container is 10.42.187.89
7 [2016-12-10T21:31:09] <Forecaster> if I replace "php" with 10.42.187.89 in the nginx config for the cgi_pass it works
8 [2016-12-10T21:31:20] <Forecaster> why is the link pointing to the wrong ip? D:
9 [2016-12-10T21:37:31] <Forecaster> it's not the host ip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-10T23:11:28] <GastroGeek> @Forecaster - are you doing the linking at runtime via docker run --link ? might be worth posting your full command and any Dockerfile/docker-composer.yml etc.I just ran docker-composer up on this: [<-CODE->] and it links through OK (assuming you set up the nginx/php confs OK) - but the php:9000 part appears to be working. [<-CODE->]
2 [2016-12-10T23:12:23] <GastroGeek> @Forecaster - also, I think --link is deprecated?https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/
3 [2016-12-10T23:43:38] <Forecaster> Hm
4 [2016-12-10T23:43:44] <Forecaster> well, the link is created by Rancher
5 [2016-12-10T23:43:51] <Forecaster> I believe it uses -links
6 [2016-12-10T23:44:51] <Forecaster>  [<-CODE->]
7 [2016-12-10T23:45:16] <Forecaster> that's the docker-compose it generates
8 [2016-12-10T23:48:21] <Forecaster> is that the same as run --link?
9 [2016-12-10T23:51:42] <Forecaster> GastroGeek:
10 [2016-12-10T23:52:52] <Forecaster> Rancher uses version 1 of docker-compose though
11 [2016-12-10T23:52:56] <Forecaster> it can't use version 2
12 [2016-12-11T00:02:55] <Forecaster> hm, maybe it can, there's been a few new versions...
13 [2016-12-11T00:03:05] <Forecaster> but how to upgrade it without loosing my settings
14 [2016-12-11T00:03:13] <Forecaster> I don't know if they're kept inside the container or not
15 [2016-12-11T00:04:05] <Forecaster> ah there's a process for it in their docs, good
16 [2016-12-11T00:35:42] <Forecaster> Hm, well, I updated rancher which now supports version 2, which allows networks, and I specified a network in my setup instead of the link
17 [2016-12-11T00:35:54] <Forecaster> but now when I try to go to the site it says it can't be reached...
18 [2016-12-11T00:39:36] <Forecaster> does the container need to be on some network to be accessible from the outside even when a port is open?
19 [2016-12-11T01:04:14] <Forecaster> I can get it working using a link and the container ip
20 [2016-12-11T01:04:23] <Forecaster> other combinations will not work
21 [2016-12-11T01:04:35] <Forecaster> : |
22 [2016-12-11T01:05:08] <Forecaster> time for bed. Continue tinkering tomorrow
23 [2016-12-11T01:05:16] <Forecaster> I'd really like this to work properly
24 [2016-12-11T01:06:49] <Forecaster>  [<-CODE->] This works, but if I remove the link it stops working, or if I try to use the link name instead of the ip
25 [2016-12-11T11:33:53] <Forecaster> what do you mean it says it's restarting?
26 [2016-12-11T11:33:54] <Forecaster> where?

2 [2016-12-11T12:10:39] <renegoretzka> Forecaster: it is image caddy and i wanted to exec -it to look at an error, where i have seen that docker keeps restarting it
3 [2016-12-11T12:11:32] <Forecaster> I don't know what that is

9 [2016-12-11T12:12:42] <Forecaster> then the container is probably failing somehow and docker restarts it
10 [2016-12-11T12:12:50] <renegoretzka> where do i see the docker log?
11 [2016-12-11T12:13:24] <Forecaster> dunno
12 [2016-12-11T12:13:31] <Forecaster> I use Rancher to manage my containers
13 [2016-12-11T12:13:37] <renegoretzka> rancher?
14 [2016-12-11T12:13:42] <renegoretzka> gonna look at that
15 [2016-12-11T12:13:47] <Forecaster> it's an orchestration system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-11T13:36:54] <vadviktor> renegoretzka: docker logscan hrelp you look into the docker container for stdout and stderr output. That is the first you should look at.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-11T15:39:16] <GastroGeek> @renegoretzka - you could also try running with: [<-CODE->] And see if it outputs anything to the console/screen during boot. If you have volumes, its likely a permissions issue. If it has requirements (like MySQL) then possibly misconfig/missing requirement etc.

1 [2016-12-11T23:12:24] <jjohnson1994> Hello, I'm trying to install mysql-server in my Dockerfile but the script breaks when the MySQL installer asks to set the root password. Is there a way I can supply a password in the Dockerfile somewhere? I'll put my Dockerfile bellow... [<-CODE->]
2 [2016-12-11T23:15:35] <jjohnson1994> I'm not making a MySQL images, plus I just want to learn Docker
3 [2016-12-11T23:17:16] <jjohnson1994> rollymaduk: I'll try that now, thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-11T23:15:07] <Forecaster> why are you making a mysql image instead of using the official one?
2 [2016-12-11T23:16:05] <Forecaster> you're making an image with mysql in it
3 [2016-12-11T23:16:11] <Forecaster> :P
4 [2016-12-11T23:16:30] <rollymaduk> jjohnson1994: have you tried installing quietly using the -q -y switch
5 [2016-12-11T23:16:56] <rollymaduk> FROM ubuntu:16.04RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -q -y \\git \\nginx \\mysql-server \\php7.0-fpm php-mysql \\php7.0-mysql
6 [2016-12-11T23:17:02] <Forecaster> the official mysql image gets the root password from an environment variable you supply when you run it in a container
7 [2016-12-11T23:17:17] <Forecaster> I don't know how they implement that though
8 [2016-12-11T23:19:34] <rollymaduk> FYI I agree with@Forecaster.. you really should use the official image and its best practice to have a single container manage a single app/service, you can alway connect them by linking
9 [2016-12-11T23:20:02] <jjohnson1994> Forecaster: &@rollymadukso would you leave mysql-server out of the Dockerfile and include the image later on in the docker-compose.yml?
10 [2016-12-11T23:20:45] <jjohnson1994> I'm trying to set up a LEMP environment if it helps
11 [2016-12-11T23:24:40] <rollymaduk> I really don't know much about LEMP but a major advantage of containerization is to have you services independent and atomic, which enables easy scaling, microservices and better  failover, its simply easier to reason about, you can then interconnect these by linking them or orchestrate with docker-compose
12 [2016-12-11T23:35:26] <rollymaduk> So I guess LEMP is a stack like MEAN and setting that up with docker could be having mongo on a separate container  and my express node.js  on a different container , I then orchestrate and connect using docker compose
13 [2016-12-12T08:22:06] <Forecaster> jjohnson1994: I have Nginx, PHP and MySQL all in separate containers
14 [2016-12-12T08:22:28] <Forecaster> I use pre-made images for each of them
15 [2016-12-12T08:24:21] <Forecaster> mysql:latestphp:7-fpmnginx:latest
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T04:09:06] <quickeee> hi any documentation to setup java developer environment using docker( i want to have a docker machine with maven/jdk/tomcat server) and developer will use eclipse to develop application.. any guidelines?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T09:13:40] <Forecaster> There is also a pre-made but unoffical nginx+fpm image, but that uses php5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T10:23:16] <jjohnson1994> Thanks@Forecaster, would you mind sharing your docker-compose.yml?
2 [2016-12-12T10:24:08] <Forecaster>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2016-12-12T10:24:41] <Forecaster> There
4 [2016-12-12T10:28:55] <jjohnson1994> Thanks a lot@Forecaster, I'm missing a lot of that in mine
5 [2016-12-12T10:48:13] <Forecaster> No problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T11:59:58] <satterly> Is docker compose yaml format version 2.1 supported in the downloadable docker app for mac, yet?
2 [2016-12-12T14:08:52] <satterly> GastroGeek: Looks like I have the same version of Docker for Mac but it was only running docker-compose 1.8.1. To get version 1.9.0 which supports version 2.1 compose files  I had to download the latest version using curl . see [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T12:49:49] <GastroGeek> @satterlyAccording to the notes, version 1.12+ supports it and I appear to have 1.12.3 via latest update? [<-CODE->]
2 [2016-12-12T12:49:56] <GastroGeek>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T14:50:13] <GastroGeek> satterly: - good spot - wonder why they didn't bother bundling it Docker for Mac... meh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-12T17:10:05] <WillSkates> Hi everyone is there a way to read the logs for a non-entrypoint process running inside a container? Whenever I try to read from /proc/<pid>/fd/1 I get "permission denied"
2 [2016-12-12T17:26:48] <WillSkates> ^^ no worries I didnt realise I could read them from the host.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-13T17:26:45] <PetrusKiendys> it's not possible to have conditionals or templating in docker-compose.yaml files right?
2 [2016-12-13T17:27:50] <PetrusKiendys> I've ended up with something like this for a service I'm composing:
3 [2016-12-13T17:28:33] <PetrusKiendys>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2016-12-13T17:29:45] <PetrusKiendys> and then I :upload one of these files manually:elasticsearch-master.yml  elasticsearch-slave1.yml  elasticsearch-slave2.yml
5 [2016-12-13T17:31:05] <PetrusKiendys> and comment out the volumes mounts that are unused, surely there must be an easier way
6 [2016-12-13T17:31:49] <PetrusKiendys> I think I'll make a bash script if docker-compose doesn't support conditionals out of the box
7 [2016-12-13T17:32:10] <PetrusKiendys> feel free to send me a PM if you have any tips :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-13T18:14:56] <dragon788> PetrusKiendys: I think with newer Docker-Compose you can use a base config and extend it for different environments
2 [2016-12-13T18:15:07] <dragon788> not sure it supports YAML inheritance and overrides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-13T20:40:06] <renegoretzka> hello, anyone using rancher here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-13T20:48:19] <rightisleft> Whats best practice to restart a node container on file change? (Seems like a bad idea to install nodemon inside the container )
2 [2016-12-13T20:49:27] <renegoretzka> why would you restart the container?
3 [2016-12-13T20:50:41] <rightisleft> well i need to restart the process to pick up file changes
4 [2016-12-13T20:51:13] <renegoretzka> rightisleft: for app.js or so files?
5 [2016-12-13T20:51:43] <renegoretzka> why dont you pull the repo with git
6 [2016-12-13T20:51:57] <rightisleft> developing locally
7 [2016-12-13T20:52:32] <rightisleft> specifically a typescript project where a large number of .js files change  on transpliation
8 [2016-12-13T20:53:04] <rightisleft> If this is the wrong approach - please let me know.
9 [2016-12-13T20:53:27] <rightisleft> but it seemed counter to dockers ethos of 1 pid per container to shove nodemon into it
10 [2016-12-13T20:55:20] <rightisleft> I've also got my production services working already - im just trying to figure out the best way to get them working as a primary developer environment
11 [2016-12-13T21:53:53] <PetrusKiendys> thanks for the tip@dragon788
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-13T22:36:50] <dragon788> rightisleft: you might want to implement something liketiniinside your containers so you can restart services without resetting the entire container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T01:00:29] <VRspace4> I have a few dozen images I'd like to pull from [<-LINK->] and pushed into a private registry. Anyone know the fastest way to do this and not have to pull and then push each image individually?
2 [2016-12-14T04:49:59] <VRspace4> 1 version of many images
3 [2016-12-14T04:50:18] <VRspace4> oh there's no built in docker command?
4 [2016-12-14T04:51:05] <VRspace4> it's actually pull, tag, and then push for each image
5 [2016-12-14T04:53:23] <dragon788> yeah, Docker follows the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it well, and not making special tools for a single use, just combining multiple tools to accomplish those special needs
6 [2016-12-14T04:54:26] <dragon788> you could either loop through all the pulls/tags/pushes separately in a shell script or you could do a pull/tag/push per image in a loop
7 [2016-12-14T04:54:44] <VRspace4> k, scripting it is. thanks for your help!
8 [2016-12-14T04:55:07] <dragon788> the trick is to remember to tag them with your private repository's hostname
9 [2016-12-14T04:55:26] <dragon788> so that a push gets them to the right place
10 [2016-12-14T04:55:52] <VRspace4> yep
11 [2016-12-14T04:56:08] <VRspace4> I've been using this to stop all containers:docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
12 [2016-12-14T04:56:21] <VRspace4> maybe I could tweak it a bit to do what I need
13 [2016-12-14T04:56:31] <dragon788> oh yeah, that one is pretty awesome
14 [2016-12-14T04:56:56] <dragon788> there is a similar one for cleaning up unused or stopped containers as well
15 [2016-12-14T10:26:44] <Forecaster> renegoretzka: I use rancher
16 [2016-12-14T18:00:40] <dragon788> Risto-Stevcev: you actually need to do those chowns inside of your ENTRYPOINT script iirc
17 [2016-12-14T18:01:51] <dragon788> tried this? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T01:24:27] <Risto-Stevcev> does anyone know how ownership works with volumes?
2 [2016-12-14T01:25:16] <Risto-Stevcev> for example, if I run something like:docker run --rm -itv $(pwd):/some/dir docker/image:tag bash
3 [2016-12-14T01:25:38] <Risto-Stevcev> and there is afoouser, it will create the directory withfooas the owner
4 [2016-12-14T01:26:07] <Risto-Stevcev> however, if I base my docker image off of another image that has afoouser, and my image has abaruser, then it will create the volume as iffooowns the volume
5 [2016-12-14T01:26:21] <Risto-Stevcev> any way I can get docker to correctly makebarthe owner?
6 [2016-12-14T04:48:47] <dragon788> you need to chown
7 [2016-12-14T04:49:27] <dragon788> VRspace4: versions of 1 container or many containers?
8 [2016-12-14T04:49:58] <dragon788> you will have to pull and push but you could easily script it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2016-12-14T16:17:34] <gdelazzer> Hello, I have duplicated a stack that I had on my personal account to my organisation account but I am not able to access this new stack url (I am using nginx). I guess it is far stretched, but any idea where I could look into to fix this issue?
2 [2016-12-14T16:18:33] <gdelazzer> (I a using Docker Cloud)
3 [2016-12-14T16:20:14] <gdelazzer> my own stack: nginx-proxy, letsencrypt, django, postgres
4 [2016-12-14T16:21:03] <Forecaster> what do you mean you can\'t "access the new url"?
5 [2016-12-14T16:22:31] <gdelazzer> well, I get an url for nginx-proxy created automatically right? I cannot access this url, I do not see any log on nginx side, and on the browser side it just "fail to open the page"
6 [2016-12-14T16:37:22] <gdelazzer> Forecaster: : here is the trace route if it helps: [<-LINK->]
7 [2016-12-14T16:37:45] <gdelazzer> on the left it is the stack on my personal account that resolves correctly
8 [2016-12-14T16:37:50] <gdelazzer> on the right the new stack
9 [2016-12-14T16:57:08] <Forecaster> I don't know nginx-proxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T16:18:59] <Forecaster> what is the stack?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T16:20:03] <MadMub> docker gurus, I wanna do something crazy, I would like to “freeze” a container, export it and restart it later, exactly where it was
2 [2016-12-14T16:20:06] <MadMub> is this possible?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T17:00:03] <killerspaz> dragon788: ironically doing a deep dive right now
2 [2016-12-14T17:01:11] <killerspaz> rightisleft: use volumes to mount your source to your app space, assuming you're running docker daemon natively. Won't work with docker-machine init'd devices through VirtualBox, as it doesn't support inotify events from hosts.
3 [2016-12-14T17:03:02] <killerspaz> rightisleft: personally I use docker-compose which i'm able to overlay configs to enable these volumes only for dev
4 [2016-12-14T17:09:16] <killerspaz> GRRRR, no rancheros gitter :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T18:16:51] <killerspaz> Ok I realize this is #docker and not #rancheros, but i'm trying to install rancheros into a VirtualBox machine, and not sure how in the world i would get my cloud-config.yml on the device as I can't ssh in or paste my sshkey into the VM (no guest addition support)
2 [2016-12-14T18:16:57] <killerspaz> anyone have any ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T20:45:33] <MadMub> found some experimental CRIU stuff that should work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T23:17:42] <Risto-Stevcev> dragon788: I figured out what the issue was. The volume owner gets mapped to the uid:gid of the currently logged in user on the host machine. The actual owner in the container is based on whoever has that uid:gid combination, which in my scenario is the first user.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-14T23:22:39] <dragon788> killerspaz: you should be able to SSH in without the guest additions, the machine will still have an IP address it just won't have the shared folder functionality, you can probably either scp a file to it or copy and paste in your SSH session with a redirect to a file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2016-12-15T13:12:22] <dragon788> Sounds like it has a corrupt or broken version of the package, try a previous tag version?
2 [2016-12-15T15:33:24] <dragon788> you probably don't want to use theCOPY . .line, you should try using actual paths for inside the container, like/or/app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2016-12-15T15:17:47] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
2 [2016-12-15T15:18:22] <galvesribeiro> I have this docker file  [<-CODE->]
3 [2016-12-15T15:18:49] <galvesribeiro> when I docker build: [<-CODE->]
4 [2016-12-15T15:19:14] <galvesribeiro> it stuck there like forever
5 [2016-12-15T15:19:26] <galvesribeiro> is there any way to see what is going on and why it is stucking there?
6 [2016-12-15T15:20:28] <galvesribeiro> (btw, docker for windows using a nanoserver image)
7 [2016-12-15T15:20:58] <galvesribeiro> the next command in the dockerfile is suppose to beWORKDIR /app
8 [2016-12-15T15:34:23] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: I'm trying to copy my app build output to the C:/app
9 [2016-12-15T15:34:34] <galvesribeiro> what would be the proper way?
10 [2016-12-15T15:38:42] <dragon788> I think justCOPY . /appwould work, though in a windows nano container not sure if it will prefer/apporC:\\app, you can try it both ways
11 [2016-12-15T15:39:04] <galvesribeiro> just tried C:/app
12 [2016-12-15T15:39:07] <galvesribeiro> however
13 [2016-12-15T15:39:13] <galvesribeiro> it hang on the  COPY action
14 [2016-12-15T15:39:16] <dragon788> if you do adocker psyou can see if the container that is being built is running, and then you could trydocker inspect <containerID>
15 [2016-12-15T15:39:26] <dragon788> was it working with the copy before, just hanging on the step after?
16 [2016-12-15T15:39:36] <galvesribeiro> basically it always hang on the 2nd step
17 [2016-12-15T15:39:37] <galvesribeiro> :(
18 [2016-12-15T15:39:55] <galvesribeiro> I removed everything and left just FROM, COPY and ENTRYPOINT
19 [2016-12-15T15:40:02] <galvesribeiro> it always freeze on the 2nd command
20 [2016-12-15T15:40:25] <dragon788> try removing the MAINTAINER line? I think it is optional but just recommended?
21 [2016-12-15T15:40:25] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
22 [2016-12-15T15:40:32] <galvesribeiro> yeah I removed
23 [2016-12-15T15:40:45] <galvesribeiro> the 2nd now is copy and still hang there
24 [2016-12-15T15:41:03] <dragon788> smahi: read back a little bit, I pasted a link regarding a good practice for changing permissions for an app
25 [2016-12-15T15:41:27] <dragon788> can you justdocker pullthe image that you are building from to see if it is locally?
26 [2016-12-15T15:42:19] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
27 [2016-12-15T15:42:28] <galvesribeiro> :(
28 [2016-12-15T15:43:29] <galvesribeiro> I'm already rebooted my machine to make sure there is no crap with the docker daemon but, it just don't work
29 [2016-12-15T15:43:32] <dragon788> you might want to see if there is an example Windows Nano Dockerfile that is using copy, or provide a full path to the input directory and output directory, does your system have Hyper-V enabled to run the Nano container? VT-x for virtualization enabled?
30 [2016-12-15T15:43:43] <dragon788> can you run the base image itself?
31 [2016-12-15T15:44:13] <galvesribeiro> the container serices are runing just fine, I can run other containers
32 [2016-12-15T15:44:18] <galvesribeiro> I did built other images
33 [2016-12-15T15:44:52] <galvesribeiro> and pushed them to my registry
34 [2016-12-15T15:47:51] <galvesribeiro> this is the dockerfile for the image I'm building from:
35 [2016-12-15T15:47:54] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
36 [2016-12-15T15:48:10] <galvesribeiro> basically it gets the nanoserver image and add .Net Core SDK in it
37 [2016-12-15T15:48:24] <galvesribeiro> it works fine, I can spin a container from it
38 [2016-12-15T16:16:30] <galvesribeiro> freaking annoying :( just hangs...
39 [2016-12-15T16:49:47] <galvesribeiro> I think I got the problem
40 [2016-12-15T16:50:02] <galvesribeiro> the freaking CRL / LF on the docker file
41 [2016-12-15T16:50:05] <galvesribeiro> dammit
42 [2016-12-15T16:56:44] <dragon788> rofl, yup line endings are a PITA
43 [2016-12-15T16:57:26] <dragon788> smahi: sorry, was mixing up my conversations, that one was for another convo
44 [2016-12-15T16:58:05] <dragon788> kind of sad Gitter doesn't have threading like FlowDock, but that's probably the only thing I really miss, as everything else is very GitHub oriented with the pulls/commits/issues
45 [2016-12-15T16:58:31] <galvesribeiro> btw
46 [2016-12-15T16:58:47] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: when I'm doing adocker rmi imagenameit removes the images locally, or it removes from my registry?
47 [2016-12-15T16:58:48] <dragon788> galvesribeiro: there are some tools for converting, I think maybe Notepad++ can do it as well as Vim
48 [2016-12-15T16:58:56] <galvesribeiro> yup
49 [2016-12-15T16:58:59] <dragon788> rmi is just removing from local
50 [2016-12-15T16:59:01] <galvesribeiro> VSCode does it for me
51 [2016-12-15T16:59:11] <galvesribeiro> right
52 [2016-12-15T16:59:13] <galvesribeiro> how to remove from the registry?
53 [2016-12-15T16:59:43] <dragon788> to remove from the registry I think you tend to have to browse it's filesystem and manually remove, depending on which registry you are using, I know Artifactory Pro allows you to delete from the web UI or their API
54 [2016-12-15T16:59:56] <galvesribeiro> ouch
55 [2016-12-15T17:00:03] <dragon788> not sure if there is acurlcommand you can use to delete on the Docker official registry
56 [2016-12-15T17:00:07] <galvesribeiro> I'm using Azure Container Registry
57 [2016-12-15T17:00:24] <galvesribeiro> will open a support ticket to check on that
58 [2016-12-15T17:00:29] <galvesribeiro> thanks! :)
59 [2016-12-15T17:01:15] <dragon788> cool, if they are using the standard registry API this might work, [<-LINK->]
60 [2016-12-15T17:02:14] <galvesribeiro> yep, it is the standard API 2.0+they just back it with a blob storage
61 [2016-12-15T17:08:42] <galvesribeiro> lol such a work to get a image deleted hehehe
62 [2016-12-15T17:08:54] <galvesribeiro> it should be a parameter of rmi or something...
63 [2016-12-15T17:47:36] <galvesribeiro> weird situation
64 [2016-12-15T17:47:47] <galvesribeiro> I can ping the container using the IP that appear on docker inspect
65 [2016-12-15T17:47:57] <galvesribeiro> however, I cant connect the Port
66 [2016-12-15T17:48:22] <galvesribeiro> I'm callingEXPOSE 5000at the Dockerfile
67 [2016-12-15T17:48:36] <galvesribeiro> and-p 9999:5000in docker run
68 [2016-12-15T17:49:11] <galvesribeiro> so from the host,telnet localhost 9999don't work :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T16:03:37] <killerspaz> dragon788: I couldn't find the defaultrancher-user password and empty password didn't work like it does on install/boot. I ended up mounting host->guest usb stick which for some reason only mounted asmsdos... either way, got 'er done!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T17:59:25] <cjus> I’m trying to install docker on Ubuntu 16.04 using these official [<-LINK->] . My question is whether it’s common for the keyserver to timeout? [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T18:15:16] <galvesribeiro> do I need to enything besides useEXPOSE 5000on Dockerfile and-p 9999:5000/tcpindocker runto get access to my container?
2 [2016-12-15T18:42:01] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: any clues?
3 [2016-12-15T19:39:01] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: it is windows
4 [2016-12-15T19:39:08] <galvesribeiro> but, no, it isn't working using the IP
5 [2016-12-15T19:41:36] <galvesribeiro> docker run -it -p 9999:5000/tcp --rm myimage
6 [2016-12-15T19:42:12] <galvesribeiro> and in another cmd, Itelnet myIP 9999
7 [2016-12-15T19:42:23] <galvesribeiro> and myIP I tried all IPs assigned to my machine
8 [2016-12-15T19:42:44] <galvesribeiro> the regular one from my wired network and all others that are added by docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T18:35:49] <erkanerol> Hi. Could you help me? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T19:20:46] <killerspaz> galvesribeiro: if your host is Win/OSX, then access it via the ip given fromdocker-machine ip; otherwise on linux you can uselocalhost
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T19:46:44] <dragon788> galvesribeiro: in my experience that should be all you need to do. Are you certain the application is running on port 5000 inside the container?
2 [2016-12-15T19:48:20] <galvesribeiro> yup
3 [2016-12-15T19:48:32] <dragon788> galvesribeiro: you should check and see whatipconfig /allreports for interfaces and IP addresses, you should be able to hit your container directly via it's Docker interface IP, and if you have exposed the port it should be available at your host's Docker interface IP, also try127.0.0.1instead oflocalhost, as Windows doesn't typically aliaslocalhostlike Linux does
4 [2016-12-15T19:48:43] <galvesribeiro> I did adocker exec...in another terminal to access powershell
5 [2016-12-15T19:48:54] <galvesribeiro> and I did telnet 5000 and it connect
6 [2016-12-15T19:49:19] <dragon788> yeah, that means that they are able to communicate via the Docker-only network
7 [2016-12-15T19:49:29] <galvesribeiro> tried 127.0.0.1 no success
8 [2016-12-15T19:49:49] <dragon788> so it could be a firewall on Windows preventing you from accessing the Docker network if you don't have a route for Windows to get there
9 [2016-12-15T19:50:14] <galvesribeiro> the funny thing is, I can ping the container IP
10 [2016-12-15T19:50:27] <galvesribeiro> and my host windows firewall is fully turned off just to be sure
11 [2016-12-15T19:51:05] <galvesribeiro> docker psreport the container running and PORTS as0.0.0.0:9999->5000/tcp
12 [2016-12-15T19:51:47] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
13 [2016-12-15T19:51:54] <galvesribeiro> docker inspect on the container
14 [2016-12-15T19:56:36] <galvesribeiro> that is really frustrating... something that is supposed to be simple just don't work :(
15 [2016-12-15T19:56:36] <dragon788> try hitting 0.0.0.0:9999 on your host?
16 [2016-12-15T19:57:05] <galvesribeiro> that will never connect
17 [2016-12-15T19:57:12] <galvesribeiro> it i sjust a wildcard for any IP
18 [2016-12-15T19:57:42] <dragon788> I tend to cheat and use Docker-Compose where possible because it handles some of the networking magic for the expose and mappings, but I haven't used it with nano yet
19 [2016-12-15T19:57:59] <galvesribeiro> it must be the same thing
20 [2016-12-15T19:58:05] <galvesribeiro> the API level is the same
21 [2016-12-15T19:58:06] <dragon788> so what if you hit the gateway IP or gateway.2 and that port?
22 [2016-12-15T19:58:06] <galvesribeiro> and
23 [2016-12-15T19:58:19] <galvesribeiro> cant connect
24 [2016-12-15T19:58:30] <galvesribeiro> the gateway IP is my machine IP on docker network
25 [2016-12-15T19:59:28] <dragon788> yeah, if you can hit the Docker container through that then it might be a routing issue that prevents your Windows "side" from accessing the container directly, but I\'d think it should map to localhost or127.0.0.1or127.0.1.1
26 [2016-12-15T20:00:14] <galvesribeiro> the problem is, if there is a route issue, how can I ping the container IP?
27 [2016-12-15T20:00:41] <dragon788> this is true :)
28 [2016-12-15T20:00:47] <galvesribeiro> :P
29 [2016-12-15T20:01:09] <dragon788> so it sounds like maybe it's the expose syntax, what if you don't expose and just do the mapping of-p 9999:5000?
30 [2016-12-15T20:01:36] <galvesribeiro> you mean remove EXPOSE from the dockerfile and just pass the parameter?
31 [2016-12-15T20:01:42] <dragon788> yeah
32 [2016-12-15T20:01:46] <galvesribeiro> ok let me try
33 [2016-12-15T20:02:58] <galvesribeiro> wait
34 [2016-12-15T20:03:04] <galvesribeiro> 9999:5000?
35 [2016-12-15T20:03:24] <galvesribeiro> it shouldn't becontainerInternalPort:HostPublicPort?
36 [2016-12-15T20:04:00] <galvesribeiro> -p 5000:9999this is how I'm doing it
37 [2016-12-15T20:04:04] <dragon788> that I'm not sure, didn't look up the proper syntax :p
38 [2016-12-15T20:04:10] <galvesribeiro> kkkkkkkkkkkk ok
39 [2016-12-15T20:04:29] <dragon788> well earlier you pasteddocker run -it -p 9999:5000/tcp --rm myimage
40 [2016-12-15T20:04:42] <dragon788> so maybe it was getting confused?
41 [2016-12-15T20:04:44] <galvesribeiro> ok well, that was another attempt
42 [2016-12-15T20:04:45] <galvesribeiro> :D
43 [2016-12-15T20:04:52] <galvesribeiro> let me confirm here
44 [2016-12-15T20:11:09] <galvesribeiro> nothing
45 [2016-12-15T20:11:10] <galvesribeiro> :(
46 [2016-12-15T20:12:28] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
47 [2016-12-15T20:12:30] <galvesribeiro> I'm doing that way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T20:19:27] <dragon788> try usingEXPOSE 5000and then just use-Pto "expose all" on the host interfaces without the-p 5000:9999?
2 [2016-12-15T20:20:43] <dragon788> are you testing this locally on a Hyper-V host or in a boot2docker?
3 [2016-12-15T20:22:07] <galvesribeiro> localy

6 [2016-12-15T20:22:18] <galvesribeiro> it add a random port
7 [2016-12-15T20:22:24] <galvesribeiro> tried access with that as well no lucky
8 [2016-12-15T20:22:49] <dragon788> hmmm
9 [2016-12-15T20:23:42] <dragon788> you might have to find some Docker on Windows pros, not sure if they have a channel on IRC or maybe check StackOverflow/ServerFault?
10 [2016-12-15T20:24:14] <galvesribeiro> Someone guys from Microsoft hang here
11 [2016-12-15T20:24:25] <galvesribeiro> but besides you, I'm see this channel a deadland :(
12 [2016-12-15T20:24:38] <galvesribeiro> issues on GH takes like months open without a reply, even on linux
13 [2016-12-15T20:24:39] <galvesribeiro> :(
14 [2016-12-15T20:24:58] <galvesribeiro> but in all cases I really appreciate your help
15 [2016-12-15T20:25:00] <galvesribeiro> thanks
16 [2016-12-15T20:25:04] <galvesribeiro> will see what I can find
17 [2016-12-15T20:28:34] <galvesribeiro> there is no docker machine here@killerspazbut thanks
18 [2016-12-15T20:29:11] <galvesribeiro> :) I know

20 [2016-12-15T20:29:23] <galvesribeiro> why do I need docker machine on windows?
21 [2016-12-15T20:30:09] <galvesribeiro> on Windows 10 it is just enable hyper-V, Container Services, install docker for windows from Beta channel and it should be ready
22 [2016-12-15T20:30:15] <galvesribeiro> no
23 [2016-12-15T20:30:18] <galvesribeiro> the VM is gone
24 [2016-12-15T20:30:21] <galvesribeiro> way back
25 [2016-12-15T20:30:22] <galvesribeiro> :)
26 [2016-12-15T20:31:37] <galvesribeiro> I think you didn't read the news on docker in about 6 months :D
27 [2016-12-15T20:32:38] <galvesribeiro> that is old
28 [2016-12-15T20:32:41] <galvesribeiro> and like I said
29 [2016-12-15T20:32:46] <galvesribeiro> only for docker linux containers
30 [2016-12-15T20:32:51] <galvesribeiro> I'm using WIndows Containers
31 [2016-12-15T20:32:52] <galvesribeiro> :)
32 [2016-12-15T20:33:04] <galvesribeiro> it is native
33 [2016-12-15T20:34:32] <killerspaz> do you have a source?
34 [2016-12-15T20:34:40] <galvesribeiro> which source?
35 [2016-12-15T20:34:45] <killerspaz> I'm not seeing anything indicating what you're saying to be how it works
36 [2016-12-15T20:34:51] <galvesribeiro> ok 1m
37 [2016-12-15T20:35:32] <killerspaz> but last thing i wanted to say was the ip's your utilizing is a subnet your docker engine is routing through; you won't be able to access that subnet directly without NAT transfers, which typically docker-machine does for you
38 [2016-12-15T20:35:32] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
39 [2016-12-15T20:36:10] <killerspaz> reading
40 [2016-12-15T20:36:11] <galvesribeiro> there are tons of videos on internet in DockerConn and other stuff for windows
41 [2016-12-15T20:36:23] <galvesribeiro> trust me, there is docker on windows :)
42 [2016-12-15T20:36:29] <galvesribeiro> without VMs
43 [2016-12-15T20:36:43] <galvesribeiro> yup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T20:27:58] <killerspaz> galvesribeiro: lots of text scrolled by, and honestly too busy/lazy to read it all, but usetelnet $(docker-machine ip) 9999
2 [2016-12-15T20:28:43] <killerspaz> also,host:portis an invalid format for telnet
3 [2016-12-15T20:28:50] <killerspaz> if your host is windows it's required
4 [2016-12-15T20:29:12] <killerspaz> if you dont' have it, you did something weird
5 [2016-12-15T20:30:08] <killerspaz> that's how docker works on windows, the docker daemon lives in a virtual machine (likely virtualbox), not on your local host; so exposed ports will be on THAT host
6 [2016-12-15T20:30:30] <killerspaz> Don't believe that's possible
7 [2016-12-15T20:30:42] <killerspaz> you ahve no way to natively run docker daemon on windows
8 [2016-12-15T20:30:44] <galvesribeiro> the only VM on windows is IF you want run Linux VMs
9 [2016-12-15T20:30:48] <galvesribeiro> ofc we have
10 [2016-12-15T20:30:48] <galvesribeiro> :D

1 [2016-12-15T20:36:35] <dragon788> yeah, it was a big deal at DockerCon 2016 iirc about it
2 [2016-12-15T20:36:43] <dragon788> and then at the Microsoft Ignite? conference
3 [2016-12-15T20:37:06] <dragon788> works on Win10 and should be "native" in 2016 iirc? or at least the first SP
4 [2016-12-15T20:37:56] <galvesribeiro> yup for both statements
5 [2016-12-15T20:38:15] <galvesribeiro> even more, on Windows you have 2 isolation levels... Hyper-V and Windows Server Containers... you decide
6 [2016-12-15T20:38:21] <galvesribeiro> linux is just linux containers
7 [2016-12-15T20:38:36] <galvesribeiro> no
8 [2016-12-15T20:38:38] <galvesribeiro> it doesn't
9 [2016-12-15T20:39:11] <galvesribeiro> in Hyper-V mode it does use a "pseudo-hypervisor", but in Windows Server Container mode, there is no hyper-V at all
10 [2016-12-15T20:39:20] <galvesribeiro> but in both cases
11 [2016-12-15T20:39:21] <killerspaz> i see
12 [2016-12-15T20:39:23] <galvesribeiro> docker behave the same way
13 [2016-12-15T20:39:29] <galvesribeiro> same APIs
14 [2016-12-15T20:39:33] <galvesribeiro> same client
15 [2016-12-15T20:40:31] <galvesribeiro> anyway, still, the fraking container isnt working here :(
16 [2016-12-15T20:41:32] <killerspaz> hmm... so... in LINUX anyway, you have a bridge to allow your local subnet to route to the docker subnet; essentially VLans
17 [2016-12-15T20:41:52] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: I think you skipped that part in the chat history
18 [2016-12-15T20:41:58] <galvesribeiro> I'm able to ping the container IP from my machine
19 [2016-12-15T20:42:00] <galvesribeiro> just fine
20 [2016-12-15T20:42:03] <killerspaz> yeah like i said too much scrolled by :P
21 [2016-12-15T20:42:10] <galvesribeiro> hehehe
22 [2016-12-15T20:42:11] <galvesribeiro> :D
23 [2016-12-15T20:42:17] <galvesribeiro> so there is no routing or vnet problem here
24 [2016-12-15T20:42:22] <killerspaz> hmmmmmmm
25 [2016-12-15T20:42:26] <killerspaz> strange indeed
26 [2016-12-15T20:42:29] <galvesribeiro> the problem is the freaking port not being mapped as it is suppose to be
27 [2016-12-15T20:42:36] <killerspaz> can you attach to the container and connect locally?
28 [2016-12-15T20:43:07] <galvesribeiro> I candocker exec containerID -it powershelland it open a PS session
29 [2016-12-15T20:43:12] <galvesribeiro> so I can do a ifconfig
30 [2016-12-15T20:43:16] <galvesribeiro> ipconfig
31 [2016-12-15T20:43:25] <galvesribeiro> the ip is the same as expect bydocker inspect
32 [2016-12-15T20:43:35] <galvesribeiro> the application inside it is running
33 [2016-12-15T20:43:36] <killerspaz> but inside can youtelnet localhost 5000
34 [2016-12-15T20:43:40] <galvesribeiro> yes
35 [2016-12-15T20:43:42] <galvesribeiro> it works
36 [2016-12-15T20:43:53] <killerspaz> is the server bound to 0.0.0.0? or just localhost?
37 [2016-12-15T20:44:07] <galvesribeiro> good question...
38 [2016-12-15T20:44:13] <galvesribeiro> it an asp.net core app
39 [2016-12-15T20:44:16] <galvesribeiro> let me confirm that
40 [2016-12-15T20:44:18] <killerspaz> just shootin things out :P
41 [2016-12-15T20:44:21] <galvesribeiro> yup
42 [2016-12-15T20:44:30] <galvesribeiro> let me check on that 1m
43 [2016-12-15T20:44:39] <dragon788> very weird that you can ping the IP but can't hit the port
44 [2016-12-15T20:44:47] <dragon788> maybe it is a NAT/networking issue with Hyper-V
45 [2016-12-15T20:44:55] <galvesribeiro> don't think so
46 [2016-12-15T20:44:58] <dragon788> can you open the Hyper-V management console and see the Docker "VM" running in there?
47 [2016-12-15T20:45:05] <killerspaz> if it's pinging, NAT is working
48 [2016-12-15T20:45:17] <killerspaz> but the server may only accept local connections
49 [2016-12-15T20:45:18] <galvesribeiro> docker VM only run if I switch to linux mode
50 [2016-12-15T20:45:34] <galvesribeiro> so I can create linux containers "on windows"
51 [2016-12-15T20:45:38] <galvesribeiro> if I don't, there is no VM there
52 [2016-12-15T20:46:04] <galvesribeiro> let me check that bound
53 [2016-12-15T21:04:14] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
54 [2016-12-15T21:04:25] <galvesribeiro> yeah, I'm listening to all IPs in the appliaction
55 [2016-12-15T21:11:28] <galvesribeiro> ok... I got something
56 [2016-12-15T21:11:50] <galvesribeiro> if I telnet 172.26.134.35 5000 on my machine
57 [2016-12-15T21:11:51] <galvesribeiro> it connect
58 [2016-12-15T21:12:20] <galvesribeiro> 5000 is the port of the application, and the one defined onEXPOSEstatement...
59 [2016-12-15T21:12:37] <galvesribeiro> it is really weird... this is supposed to be the internal port, not the one open
60 [2016-12-15T21:20:45] <dragon788> I think that is the IP I was trying to stumble across when I said try the gateway :P
61 [2016-12-15T21:21:07] <dragon788> whatever the "Docker interface" of your host machine is, or is that the docker interface of your container?
62 [2016-12-15T21:21:22] <galvesribeiro> the gateway is the .1 on that 172.26.134.0 network
63 [2016-12-15T21:21:32] <galvesribeiro> that is the container IP
64 [2016-12-15T21:21:34] <galvesribeiro> the .35
65 [2016-12-15T21:21:46] <galvesribeiro> the .1 is the gateway on the container
66 [2016-12-15T21:21:53] <galvesribeiro> which is the IP of my machine in that network
67 [2016-12-15T21:22:10] <galvesribeiro> docker creates 2 networks here
68 [2016-12-15T21:22:14] <galvesribeiro> (dont ask me why)
69 [2016-12-15T21:22:17] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
70 [2016-12-15T21:22:25] <killerspaz> galvesribeiro: linkis what you want to cross-talk between containers... docker-compose does that all sexy-like for you
71 [2016-12-15T21:22:48] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: cool, will have a look on that
72 [2016-12-15T21:23:16] <killerspaz> you can also manage docker networks pretty easily and limit communication to subnets as seen fit
73 [2016-12-15T21:23:39] <galvesribeiro> yeah, that would be another step on our docker learning curve
74 [2016-12-15T21:23:53] <galvesribeiro> for now its ok that all containers talk to each other
75 [2016-12-15T21:24:05] <galvesribeiro> because the hosts for a group of container types, will be isolated
76 [2016-12-15T21:25:32] <galvesribeiro> anyway, time to drive home, will continue from there
77 [2016-12-15T21:25:42] <galvesribeiro> thank you folks, will be back later
78 [2016-12-15T21:26:52] <killerspaz> also every docker-compose config creates it's own network unless specified, so typically you don't have to worry about it
79 [2016-12-15T21:27:06] <killerspaz> so you can cluster associative services to a single config and not concern yourself about it
80 [2016-12-15T21:27:15] <galvesribeiro> humm
81 [2016-12-15T21:27:18] <galvesribeiro> that is good
82 [2016-12-15T21:27:19] <galvesribeiro> :)
83 [2016-12-15T21:27:33] <galvesribeiro> our scenario is a bit complex in terms of networking
84 [2016-12-15T21:27:42] <galvesribeiro> due to PCI compliance
85 [2016-12-15T21:27:45] <killerspaz> sounds cool
86 [2016-12-15T21:27:49] <killerspaz> ahhh, vlans out the wazoo
87 [2016-12-15T21:27:50] <galvesribeiro> I'll have a look on that
88 [2016-12-15T21:27:54] <galvesribeiro> yeah
89 [2016-12-15T21:27:58] <galvesribeiro> TONS of vLans
90 [2016-12-15T21:28:07] <killerspaz> good ol SAS 70
91 [2016-12-15T21:28:07] <galvesribeiro> and Network Security Groups
92 [2016-12-15T21:28:11] <galvesribeiro> hehehehe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T20:38:29] <killerspaz> So i've only  lightly skimmed it, but it still sounds ilke it's using Hyper-V for the daemon host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T21:17:49] <killerspaz> might be something they're still wokring through? definitely sounds weird
2 [2016-12-15T21:18:54] <galvesribeiro> yeah, will open an issue on GH and hope someone will get back later
3 [2016-12-15T21:19:06] <galvesribeiro> at least now my developers can use the container
4 [2016-12-15T21:19:28] <galvesribeiro> now I need to find a way to connect this container with one running SQL server
5 [2016-12-15T21:19:39] <galvesribeiro> just for development
6 [2016-12-15T21:19:56] <galvesribeiro> anyway, again, thank you@killerspazand@dragon788for try to help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-15T21:31:12] <killerspaz> can get even more fun with docker swarm, and docker stacks with docker-cloud
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T02:44:42] <Avasz> I am trying to run as a different user in entrypoint (docker alpine), but I am getting:su: must be suid to work properly. Any help please?`
2 [2016-12-16T02:45:20] <Avasz>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2016-12-16T02:45:33] <Avasz> that is my entrypoint to run start.sh as user dev.
4 [2016-12-16T02:48:15] <Avasz> My solution for now is to specifyUSER devbefore ENTRYPOINT.
5 [2016-12-16T02:57:46] <Avasz> I don't think so
6 [2016-12-16T02:58:46] <Avasz> usingUSER devis helping me for now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T02:57:37] <dragon788> Does the Alpine container come with sudo?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T09:59:54] <marcelmfs> Is there any Makefile-fu master around here? I'm trying to come up with a Makefile that will build docker images from one repo where each folder have a Dockerfile and it's build context, where make will dynamically list all folders and generate the dependency tree so that whenever an upstream image is rebuilt make will also rebuild all dependent containers. In short, I need to come up with a dynamic way of generating a dependency likenginx: alpine,html5_app: nginxonly by parsing Dockerfiles on multiple folders.
2 [2016-12-16T10:01:28] <marcelmfs> so far I have a bash one liner that looks likefind . -name Dockerfile -exec dirname {} \\; -exec egrep FROM {} \\; | sed -e 's/\\.\\/\\(.*\\)/$(BUILD_DIR)\\/\\1:/;s/FROM .*\\/\\(.*\\):.*/$(BUILD_DIR)\\/\\1/' | sed '$!N;s/\\n/ /'and outputs something like:
3 [2016-12-16T10:02:00] <marcelmfs>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2016-12-16T13:46:17] <marcelmfs> dragon788: thanks but my compose files are not being used to build anything, just to start my services (they're split across several different repositories), while all Dockerfiles are within one single repo structure.
5 [2016-12-16T13:46:29] <marcelmfs> And I've figured it out ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T10:46:10] <PavelPenkov> How would you guys go about using Docker to develop an application that has some kind of "development" mode which is wildly different from "production"? Say something with Webpack/Gulp/Rails asset pipeline?
2 [2016-12-16T13:16:28] <dragon788> marcelmfs: try docker-compose, it will pretty much do that for you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T13:16:10] <EugenMayer> Pavel there are like a gazzilion tutorials, howtos an examples in the web for this. there is no simple one line answer
2 [2016-12-16T13:16:48] <EugenMayer> dragon788: an if not, just install it :)
3 [2016-12-16T13:17:38] <EugenMayer> does anybody has a good replacement for docker-compose cp ? This is the only missing part holding me back stopping using named containers
4 [2016-12-16T13:18:06] <EugenMayer> does anybody knows if docker-compose exec <servicename> does run the specified command on all containers of this service ( scaled )?
5 [2016-12-16T13:21:08] <dragon788> I don't know offhand, otherwise you could maybe list and loop containers matching the servicename
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T14:40:09] <siassaj> So I'm trying to figure out a way to build images that arecompletedbuilds for my rails app deployments. I've basically read a bunch of stuff and come to the conclusion that I should create an image that has all my base dependencies like ruby version, nodejs, etc. Then i should create a dockerfile using that image as base, then copying over my 'tmp' directory that contains build cache, my 'node_modules' dir that contains previously downloaded javascript dependencies, and similarly so for my gems, and my javascript and image/css precompiled assets. After copying them into the image i can run my ruby 'build' tasks, then save all the new tmp, node_modules etc contents back to the host computer filesystem, and finish off the dockerfile.
2 [2016-12-16T14:40:41] <siassaj> If i'm not mistake this can give me very fast build times with minimal downloading etc and leads to a single image that I can spin up on any number of machines very quickly
3 [2016-12-16T14:40:47] <siassaj> does this approach make any sense?
4 [2016-12-16T14:42:05] <siassaj> apologies for the lack of sensible terminology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T14:45:54] <marcelmfs> if you want to leverage caching of build tasks, yes, that's the best solution. But to release a container for production, I usually remove build tools and ship the container with the minimum to run the service.
2 [2016-12-16T14:47:06] <siassaj> I dont understand shipping containers
3 [2016-12-16T14:47:19] <siassaj> i thought you ship images, and when you run them you end up with a container on the host system
4 [2016-12-16T14:47:54] <siassaj> are you saying i should build everything first, then copy what i need into a docker image?
5 [2016-12-16T14:47:58] <siassaj> that could work too
6 [2016-12-16T14:48:51] <siassaj> to be honest docker has me questioning my intelligence or ability
7 [2016-12-16T14:48:58] <siassaj> it's not easy to understand the workflows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T15:51:12] <dragon788> image/container are used synonymously most of the time, the difference comes from how they are referenced locally, an image is the collection of layers, a "container" is a running instance of an image
2 [2016-12-16T15:51:48] <dragon788> but your container will have the same contents regardless of the system you run on assuming you built the image as a standalone that doesn't use volume mapping
3 [2016-12-16T15:53:14] <dragon788> one workflow I\'ve seen is having a "build" container that assembles all your dependencies and your package, and then outputting that to a local volume share, then having a second container that only has the application dependencies (not the build ones) and copying the build container\'s output into the runtime container
4 [2016-12-16T15:54:26] <dragon788> this may end up being more than two builds because you might have a base layer with just the application dependencies as those would also probably be required for the build, then you make a "build" image and use the output of that to build the "prod" image on top of the base
5 [2016-12-16T16:14:26] <siassaj> dragon788: that's quite complex. very interesting
6 [2016-12-16T16:14:40] <siassaj> it pays to be creative with this it seems
7 [2016-12-16T16:15:07] <siassaj> not much in google results to teach us how to do these complex, efficient/fast to build and then deploy flows
8 [2016-12-16T16:15:08] <dragon788> yeah, there are ways to use and abuse the layers and caching depending on where you want to focus your energy
9 [2016-12-16T16:15:49] <dragon788> another trick you'll see is when somebody does a [<-CODE->]
10 [2016-12-16T16:16:22] <dragon788> because every RUN/COPY/etc creates a new layer
11 [2016-12-16T16:16:53] <siassaj> yeah I understandthat. In fact the dockerfile albeit simple seems... too simple
12 [2016-12-16T16:17:06] <dragon788> and most Linux containers that aren't build on Alpine also take pains to clear out their package manager cache before packing the first time
13 [2016-12-16T16:17:36] <siassaj> to keep the size minimal e
14 [2016-12-16T16:17:37] <siassaj> eh
15 [2016-12-16T16:17:38] <dragon788> well as they've added docker-compose and other higher level orchestration mechanisms the simplicity of the Dockerfile has been helpful
16 [2016-12-16T16:18:16] <dragon788> yeah, though the "smallest" Windows container is still like 300Mb :P maybe somebody has gotten that down, but the busybox binary and the Alpine base image are both <10Mb iirc
17 [2016-12-16T16:18:18] <siassaj> the forced caching on each layer is scary
18 [2016-12-16T16:18:43] <dragon788> why is it scary? they get cached by md5sum/sha1 so you know the contents are immutable
19 [2016-12-16T16:19:16] <siassaj> also I don't understand how distributing images works. Ithinkwhat happens is that you 'push' an image to a repo, which is actually sending meta data + a bunch of layersafterchecking the repo to see if it already has those layers or not. As in it only sends up what it needs to
20 [2016-12-16T16:19:19] <siassaj> is that correct?
21 [2016-12-16T16:19:41] <siassaj> well the scary part was the hacks I saw to get specific layers not to cache
22 [2016-12-16T16:19:56] <siassaj> which I undrestand busts everything after
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T16:03:39] <galvesribeiro> one workflow I\'ve seen is having a "build" container that assembles all your dependencies and your package, and then outputting that to a local volume share, then having a second container that only has the application dependencies (not the build ones) and copying the build container\'s output into the runtime containerThis is quite same process .Net Core team is using... One container with the SDK and the other only with the runtime
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T16:36:02] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
2 [2016-12-16T16:36:09] <galvesribeiro> curiousity...
3 [2016-12-16T16:36:14] <galvesribeiro> if I spin up 2 containers
4 [2016-12-16T16:36:26] <galvesribeiro> no docker-compose or link enabled
5 [2016-12-16T16:36:32] <galvesribeiro> and I need to make them talk...
6 [2016-12-16T16:36:35] <galvesribeiro> is that possible?
7 [2016-12-16T16:36:55] <galvesribeiro> I mean, I spin up a SQL Server in one container, exposed the port 1433
8 [2016-12-16T16:37:04] <galvesribeiro> and from another container I'm trying to connect to it
9 [2016-12-16T16:37:13] <galvesribeiro> will it work?
10 [2016-12-16T16:37:45] <galvesribeiro> hum? sorry I'm not following...
11 [2016-12-16T16:37:59] <galvesribeiro> DOCKER_HOST is a env variable for docker engine, right?
12 [2016-12-16T16:38:31] <mihasK> I mean ip of host machine inside docker container
13 [2016-12-16T16:38:48] <galvesribeiro> ok
14 [2016-12-16T16:38:52] <galvesribeiro> let me try
15 [2016-12-16T16:39:13] <galvesribeiro> you mean the HOST IP on docker network, right?
16 [2016-12-16T16:39:39] <mihasK> there's no such variable, but you can find the ip . it depends on docker network used
17 [2016-12-16T16:41:35] <mihasK> galvesribeiro: I will send you how to get host ip soon
18 [2016-12-16T16:42:00] <galvesribeiro> don't work
19 [2016-12-16T16:42:24] <galvesribeiro> the hostIP is simple... just do a ipconfig
20 [2016-12-16T16:42:26] <galvesribeiro> or
21 [2016-12-16T16:42:38] <mihasK> /sbin/ip route|awk '/default/ { print $3 }'
22 [2016-12-16T16:42:41] <galvesribeiro> just get the gateway IP on the docker inspect of the container
23 [2016-12-16T16:42:53] <galvesribeiro> sorry, I'm on Windows Containers :)
24 [2016-12-16T16:42:58] <mihasK> hah)
25 [2016-12-16T16:43:22] <galvesribeiro> but anyway, it doesn't work, the container is not talking to the SQL Server :(
26 [2016-12-16T16:43:25] <mihasK> I'm not sure then. But do you forward ports?
27 [2016-12-16T16:43:54] <galvesribeiro> yep, they areEXPOSEd and I started it with-p 1433:1433
28 [2016-12-16T16:44:46] <mihasK> then it should work. If the port 1433 is accessible on host ip, it should be accessible from container too
29 [2016-12-16T16:44:59] <galvesribeiro> yeah but it doesn't
30 [2016-12-16T16:49:29] <mihasK> I'm not sure how it is on Windows, but on linux sometimes default settings for databases don't allow to connections from outside: it's configured for 127.0.0.1:1433 instead of 0.0.0.0:1433
31 [2016-12-16T16:49:50] <galvesribeiro> that wasn't the problem
32 [2016-12-16T16:50:02] <galvesribeiro> I'm able to connect to SQL from my machine
33 [2016-12-16T16:50:32] <galvesribeiro> the problem was the Password not meet the minumal complexity when starting the container
34 [2016-12-16T16:50:33] <galvesribeiro> hehehe
35 [2016-12-16T16:50:34] <mihasK> it would be a problem on linux: you could connect from localhost (127.0.0.1), but not from other networks
36 [2016-12-16T16:50:36] <galvesribeiro> looks like it work
37 [2016-12-16T16:50:38] <galvesribeiro> let me check here
38 [2016-12-16T16:51:21] <mihasK> 127.0.0.1 doesn't allow connections from other networks, only from localhost
39 [2016-12-16T16:51:44] <galvesribeiro> yup, that is why I'm trying the connection to the database IP address
40 [2016-12-16T16:51:53] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
41 [2016-12-16T16:51:56] <galvesribeiro> it was able to connect
42 [2016-12-16T16:52:01] <galvesribeiro> now the error is diff
43 [2016-12-16T16:52:07] <galvesribeiro> but thanks, I got the message :)
44 [2016-12-16T16:52:37] <mihasK> this is a progress btw)
45 [2016-12-16T16:52:43] <galvesribeiro> :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T16:37:19] <mihasK> you can open ports on host machine, and use DOCKER_HOST host for connection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T16:40:50] <siassaj> and a docker image isn't 1 file is it, it's a bunch of slices and some meta data describing which slice in which order, eh?
2 [2016-12-16T16:41:27] <galvesribeiro> mihasK: no lucky
3 [2016-12-16T16:51:35] <siassaj> bind to 0.0.0.0
4 [2016-12-16T16:51:38] <siassaj> usually works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T17:16:28] <dragon788> siassaj: you are correct, if you are building on top of the same base layer for a specific image "repository" then it will already have that base layer if you have previous pushed an image to it, then it only has to transfer the newer/different layers
2 [2016-12-16T17:16:52] <dragon788> what tricks for cache busting are you referring to?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-16T22:37:10] <hillct> I wonder if someone more knowledgeable than I might be able to speak to this issue: [<-ISSUE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-17T06:39:20] <siassaj> dragon788: i saw a few, i don't remember exactly off the top of my head.
2 [2016-12-17T06:43:28] <siassaj> so i need to create an image to serve as my 'base' image for my application images
3 [2016-12-17T06:44:25] <siassaj> so instead of FROM ruby:2.3.1 I'd rather do FROM my-company-app-env
4 [2016-12-17T06:45:09] <siassaj> and I suspect that I'll have a bunch of other utility apps with their own docker images, possibly basing off other app enviroments, such as my slackbot etc
5 [2016-12-17T06:45:20] <siassaj> these 'base' images that I want to use, should each have a director and a Dockefile
6 [2016-12-17T06:46:15] <siassaj> or should I just create a dir like 'company-dockerfiles',  and put 'app-env.dockerfile', 'slackbot-env.dockerfile', etc
7 [2016-12-17T06:46:16] <siassaj> ?

1 [2016-12-18T11:47:43] <fr4ngus> Hi guys, I want to access to one of my container from another device connect to the same netowk
2 [2016-12-18T11:48:02] <fr4ngus> So I want to know how could I expose my nginx container to the network ?
3 [2016-12-18T11:49:31] <fr4ngus> I'm using docker compose, so I can launch multiple services, and I need to share a specific service (nginx)
4 [2016-12-18T16:12:00] <fr4ngus> It's not my question, I try to access from my smartphone that is connect on the same network, and I can't
5 [2016-12-18T16:32:34] <fr4ngus> I launch my container on my mac and after try to access with my smartphone to the nginx container but doesn't work.
6 [2016-12-18T18:39:27] <fr4ngus> I solved my problem by adding a new rul in my nginx conf, the problem doesn't come from my docker conf but my nginx conf.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-18T14:30:53] <EugenMayer> fr4ngus: when you start services ( that is what is called a unit in docker-compose ) you can access every other service of this "docker-compose.yml" file by using the service name
2 [2016-12-18T14:31:23] <EugenMayer> ping <servicename> will work, but also telnet <servicename> 80 for your nginx-container
3 [2016-12-18T14:31:44] <EugenMayer> you do not need to expose any ports in the internal network of services in a docker-compose network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-18T21:53:26] <krishnaghatti_twitter> i am checking out the " --read-only” option ..was wondering how to set that as default in the docker DOCKER_OPTS. Did any one try it out?
2 [2016-12-18T21:54:35] <krishnaghatti_twitter> i want to start all my docker images RO by default and want to set RO as default option.
3 [2016-12-18T21:54:57] <krishnaghatti_twitter> some thing like this worksdocker run -t -i -d --read-only --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /tmp python:3 /bin/bash
4 [2016-12-18T21:55:13] <krishnaghatti_twitter> want to set it as default with DOCKER_OPTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-19T02:45:50] <siassaj> are there any strategies to speed up docker COPY commands. I have to copy several cache directories from host into my image so that my asset compilation and app build is fast. But these directories are full of files.
2 [2016-12-19T02:46:00] <siassaj> Is it faster to tar them first, transfer the tar and untar it (or use ADD)
3 [2016-12-19T02:46:20] <siassaj> even ENV commands take several seconds to complete
4 [2016-12-19T02:48:14] <siassaj> perhaps I'll load host volumes instead of copying
5 [2016-12-19T02:49:34] <siassaj> ah i see I'd have to mount it, run my commands then commit the container to a new image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-19T08:05:47] <ely029> hey guys how can I deploy the database in mssql image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-19T08:13:51] <marcelmfs> siassaj: use volumes bind mounts. I have adeveloperuser, which has in it's$HOMEall cached folders from npm, bower, ivy2, and so on. Then I only have-v $HOME:/home/docker_userindocker run
2 [2016-12-19T16:03:55] <marcelmfs> so use s3 to sync artifacts, or something like artifactory or sonatype's nexus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-19T14:00:45] <alexisvincent> Hi guys, I have an interesting problem that I’m trying to solve, and I wondered if anybody here has any input. I’m building an distributed incremental job runner (want to be able to run locally, on kubernetes and others). Each job generates files. Some jobs need to see and add to previous jobs files. Multiple jobs might need to rely on the output of a single other job. Job outputs should be immutable. Delay between starting jobs should be as little as possible. Jobs probably will run on different machines. The layer I use for file storage should be able to run anywhere docker can run, and I have limited ‘control' over the underlying machine. As in I can’t install kernel extensions or partition drives. So the storage layer should be as thin as possible.My current thinking is to use something like UFS… And distribute layers manually…Alternatively, if I could use the underlying docker storage layer that would be awesome. Any ideas?
2 [2016-12-19T14:01:59] <alexisvincent> Also jobs should be able to run in parrallel where possible (shouldnt be limited by single write master)
3 [2016-12-19T15:37:37] <marcelmfs> don't create files if you need to distribute output, use a database in the cloud.
4 [2016-12-19T15:40:57] <alexisvincent> marcelmfs: The output is files. Basically build artifacts
5 [2016-12-19T16:05:59] <alexisvincent> Need something faster then that and more lightweight. These would be intermediary steps, not a final artifact.

1 [2016-12-19T21:22:44] <dragon788> can you find another Dockerfile that uses it to see if it is just this particular file? I'm not sure I've seen two WORKDIRs defined in a single file before
2 [2016-12-19T21:23:42] <msitruk> yes was orking on other project
3 [2016-12-19T22:01:27] <dragon788> mamartins: the container may assume you already rannpm installin the directory where the Dockerfile and packages.json is loacated?
4 [2016-12-19T22:37:09] <dragon788> that sounds like a failure of node inside the container, you might ask in the nodejs/node channel about that

1 [2016-12-20T08:46:34] <marcelmfs> alexisvincent: Ok, if you need something better than I'd say your requirements of synchronizing artifacts between multiple locations is pretty much a blocking point. Or you can use something like Jenkins to actively push artifacts around as soon as they're built to synch every location, but still, you'll be no better than using S3 as the bottleneck would still be on the network LAN transfers.
2 [2016-12-20T13:51:46] <marcelmfs> docker does not distribute any volume afaik
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-20T08:49:33] <alexisvincent> marcelmfs: I'm kind of thinking of using overlay fs, and creating a unified fs, then pushing tars of the diff around the cluster via some distributed file sharing system.
2 [2016-12-20T08:49:45] <alexisvincent> Much like docker does internally

6 [2016-12-21T16:29:42] <marcelmfs> can you even resolve names from the docker host?
7 [2016-12-21T16:32:16] <darkSasori> marcelmfs: yes, and if i addnameserver 8.8.8.8in /etc/resolv.conf in docker, this works
8 [2016-12-21T16:34:12] <darkSasori> but this only happens in some connections, in office works but in home dont

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-21T00:37:13] <dragon788> sometimes depending on the kernel module your docker is using you can get some weird file caching behaviors, iirc aufs depending on the system can be one, there are a few different options
2 [2016-12-21T17:04:13] <dragon788> darkSasori: is dnsmasq enabled on your host? sometimes this doesn't update if you change networks
3 [2016-12-21T18:09:21] <dragon788> sbbowers__twitter: typically this is construct you create inside your container that picks up the user running the container's ID and chown all the files inside the container to that user during the build

1 [2016-12-21T17:31:58] <sbbowers__twitter> So when I run a docker instance, my entrypoint runs some bootstrapping commands to sync dependancies (specifically php'scomposer install).  These dependencies are written to disk owned by root:root. Is there a way to tell docker (specifically docker-compose) to write files as the user I'm running docker as?
2 [2016-12-21T17:49:55] <sbbowers__twitter> Looks like docker-composer supports auserkey in the yaml file. I'll try it out, but it would be nice if there was an agnostic way to let all developers run the same config.

1 [2016-12-21T18:38:37] <sbbowers__twitter> dragon788: So the "standard approach" is to bake in "gosu" into all of your docker images by curling a binary off the net and then require your entrypoint to run the command through that, which gives you the option of passing an environment variable with the ID of your current user, all of which won\'t work with docker-compose. Do I understand that right?
2 [2016-12-21T18:40:30] <dragon788> I thinkgosuis one way to do it, but really since it isn't recommended to run as root anyways, a lot of containers will chmod everything to a known user and run everything as that, the trick is whether that UID exists on your system or not
3 [2016-12-21T18:47:38] <sbbowers__twitter> So the easy way would to do auseradd -u {some arbitrary ID I pick} docker-useron the host and then pass that user ID to docker's -u?
4 [2016-12-21T18:48:25] <sbbowers__twitter> If I specify "docker-user" to docker, will it resolve the ID from the host, or does it do a useradd and create a new user?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-21T19:01:53] <dragon788> hi@renegoretzkayou might need to ping the Rancher channel as I'm not that familiar with how that platform interacts with containers and forwarding
2 [2016-12-21T19:02:29] <dragon788> at first blush I\'d check and make sure the containers are on the same network "segment" and then that you exposed the appropriate ports from the wordpress container
3 [2016-12-21T19:03:35] <renegoretzka> gitter dont have a rancher channel
4 [2016-12-21T19:04:14] <renegoretzka> i linked both, wordpress and caddy server.. and i even can ping them.. thats the weird path
5 [2016-12-21T19:05:15] <sbbowers__twitter> Thanks for your help,@dragon788
6 [2016-12-21T19:05:38] <dragon788> you can rundocker exec <wordpress id> ping <caddyIP>@renegoretzka?
7 [2016-12-21T19:05:50] <dragon788> np@sbbowers__twitterI just make it up as I go along :D
8 [2016-12-21T19:06:19] <renegoretzka> yea@dragon788
9 [2016-12-21T19:49:53] <dragon788> I don't know if the container could have telnet, but you could try runningtelnet <caddyIP> portinstead of  ping, does that work?
10 [2016-12-21T19:50:34] <renegoretzka> hmm
11 [2016-12-21T19:51:52] <renegoretzka> telnet does not exist
12 [2016-12-21T20:07:34] <renegoretzka> dragon788: it seems like caddyserver does not get any request from outside
13 [2016-12-21T20:07:43] <renegoretzka> since caddyserver didnt write anything to log
14 [2016-12-21T20:07:49] <renegoretzka> what can be the reason?
15 [2016-12-21T20:51:30] <dragon788> if it doesn't have a port exposed or if the service isn't running properly inside that could be an issue

1 [2016-12-22T09:56:44] <dmi3zkm> Hi allI have faced an issue regarding docker registry. I have a jenkins which builds new images after each stable commit in VCS. These images promoted to some staging environment. When docker registry runs out of available space jenkins fails to push new images. Is there any thing that would delete old images on scheduled basis from docker registry that are no longer used on my staging environment ?
2 [2016-12-22T12:36:00] <dmi3zkm> GastroGeek: thank for your answer, I will research on that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-22T11:18:38] <GastroGeek> @dmi3zkm - dunno about best practice etc but you could mash something together with a script to automagically remove images from storage?https://github.com/burnettk/delete-docker-registry-imageMaybe as part of the build/deploy?
2 [2016-12-22T11:19:52] <GastroGeek> @dmi3zkm - also check up on 'garbage collection' - newer version may already have support for this?https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#read-only-mode

6 [2016-12-22T22:12:45] <renegoretzka> wtf?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-23T07:09:07] <renegoretzka> Hello,I got Caddyserver running. The Database is working correctly now and moved the domain to point to my new server. Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx. So this is working fine, but when I again bind the WordPress container to Caddy its just nothing.Do you have a clue what can be the reason to get no response on the client but requests on the server?Thank you!

1 [2016-12-25T23:17:53] <mmisztal1980> hi all, I'm working on a container that I intend to run in a swarm env, once it's active - I want it to register with consul, how can I tell what node is it running on? I think I'm going to need it to register with service discovery...

1 [2016-12-26T12:00:02] <alexisvincent> Is it possible to store layers as a DAG in the registry? Or does it only support layers that are organised as a tree

1 [2016-12-26T18:19:55] <pfenig> all: trying to find a simple way to tail or access stdout of a linked container running a simple service from another container (running tests) - I'd rather not modify the container running the service i.e. just use stdout - is there a good way to write stdout to a shared volume??

1 [2016-12-27T01:17:03] <iDVB> I'm new to docker and have been working at getting react-starter-kit up and running for dev and prod using docker-compose. I keep running into issues no matter how I seem to go about it.  Using straight docker I get it running but I can't seem to browse to the server thats running in the container.
2 [2016-12-27T01:18:45] <iDVB> When I use docker-compose I get an error likesh: babel-node: not foundwhich I think might be happening because for some reason the container is not in the right directory
3 [2016-12-27T01:19:10] <iDVB> Anyone that might be able to lend a hand would be very appreciated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-27T03:17:34] <iDVB> Easier question.... for those looking to use docker for dev workflows that use hot reloading/auto reloading.... is there a best practise for node_modules folder? I mean the node_modules folder needs to be compiled on the container but conversely I need to setup a volume for the src so hot reloading works. Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume. Not to mention that folder being leftover after compose is shut down.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-27T20:46:13] <killerspaz> iDVB: simply supplying the volume of the source root folder should do what you want

1 [2016-12-28T14:15:38] <olsynt> hi, does containers with c# must run on windows vm ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-28T17:31:46] <dragon788> is it .NET Core C# or legacy .NET Framework C#?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-28T18:27:59] <galvesribeiro> olsynt: hey, if you plan to use .Net Full Framework, usemicrosoft/windowsservercoreimage and if you want to run .Net Core, usemicrosoft/nanoserverimage... You can run .Net Core onmicrosoft/windowsservercorehowever it is probably a waste of resources...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-28T20:10:14] <killerspaz> Anyone doing any stuff for container dependencies? I havedepends_onin my compose file, but it appears that really doesn't mean much if your command takes a while to initialize.... I see people doing netcat tests to other containers, and this ( [<-LINK->] ), but it feels so dirty... Is there really nothing internal?
2 [2016-12-28T20:22:17] <killerspaz> also, that doesn't even seem to work, it exits almost immediately and logs show order is NOT kept the way i want
3 [2016-12-28T21:11:27] <killerspaz> Seriously trying to decouple this crap, and it seems every implementation people have come up with 1000% directly couple containers, which seems to defeat the purpose of a lot of this effort people (including myself) do to abstract ports and hostnames....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T16:11:27] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T16:13:32] <galvesribeiro> can an application running inside a container detect which port was used as public in-p xxxx:YYYYY? i.e I want to detect what is the port outside the container so the APP can listen to it even when using random ports generated by docker
2 [2016-12-29T16:24:14] <killerspaz> docker inspect <container_id>
3 [2016-12-29T16:24:25] <killerspaz> that'll give you everything docker knows about the container
4 [2016-12-29T16:43:36] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: I mean from inside the container
5 [2016-12-29T16:44:19] <killerspaz> did you see this? [<-ISSUE->]
6 [2016-12-29T16:44:20] <galvesribeiro> I mean, after docker spin up the container, my app needs to be aware of its IP and port exposed by docker so it can start listening on that port
7 [2016-12-29T16:44:42] <j6k4m8> I would pass those as environment variables if you can — should be easier and safer to run on different machines
8 [2016-12-29T16:44:54] <killerspaz> yeah was going to ask why not supply the port?
9 [2016-12-29T16:45:57] <galvesribeiro> Because I dont wnat to be supplying ports each I spin a new container
10 [2016-12-29T16:46:10] <galvesribeiro> I just want to run it and it resolve itself
11 [2016-12-29T16:46:29] <galvesribeiro> It is pretty common and useful for those mocroservices scenarios
12 [2016-12-29T16:46:35] <galvesribeiro> Let me see that issue
13 [2016-12-29T16:58:41] <galvesribeiro> the issue still open, 3 years...
14 [2016-12-29T16:58:45] <galvesribeiro> anyway
15 [2016-12-29T16:59:30] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: the way docker works today as you are stating works pretty well if you are using simple/regular webapps
16 [2016-12-29T16:59:46] <galvesribeiro> if you have a complex distributed cluster you will end up with this problem
17 [2016-12-29T17:00:29] <galvesribeiro> ok look at this [<-LINK->]
18 [2016-12-29T17:01:10] <killerspaz> yeah don't do that
19 [2016-12-29T17:01:17] <killerspaz> use docker network properly and you won't have this issue
20 [2016-12-29T17:01:18] <galvesribeiro> the two containers running that has the SiloHost.exe,EXPOSE 2323on its docker file, and they write to a membership table store its port
21 [2016-12-29T17:01:23] <galvesribeiro> no no
22 [2016-12-29T17:01:29] <galvesribeiro> listen
23 [2016-12-29T17:01:36] <galvesribeiro> (read :P )
24 [2016-12-29T17:02:26] <galvesribeiro> theOrleansClient.exewhich may be a container or not, read from the Membership table storage and know that both silos are running on 2323 so it try to connect to one of them and fail
25 [2016-12-29T17:02:41] <galvesribeiro> because the port exposed is 3333 and 4444
26 [2016-12-29T17:02:47] <killerspaz> imo, you shouldn't be spinning up docker containers manually (unless purely testing that single container alone) nor exposing ports manually (again, unless testing)... docker network bridges take care of all that for you.
27 [2016-12-29T17:03:05] <killerspaz> again, all 50 of my services run on the same port
28 [2016-12-29T17:03:05] <galvesribeiro> no it doesn't
29 [2016-12-29T17:03:09] <galvesribeiro> that is the point
30 [2016-12-29T17:03:20] <galvesribeiro> the client connects to the silos by reading the membership table
31 [2016-12-29T17:03:24] <killerspaz> in that drawing, you have no context of any network
32 [2016-12-29T17:03:34] <galvesribeiro> we don't need the context
33 [2016-12-29T17:03:36] <galvesribeiro> ignore that
34 [2016-12-29T17:03:41] <killerspaz> no i'm telling you that you DO
35 [2016-12-29T17:03:54] <killerspaz> in order for the containers to talk to each other without you having to worry about port mapping
36 [2016-12-29T17:04:24] <killerspaz> unless you're not detailing enough information, this is the basis of docker and microservices, and not out of the norm
37 [2016-12-29T17:04:42] <galvesribeiro> assume that the containers are reacheable to each other
38 [2016-12-29T17:05:15] <killerspaz> i have 50 services per cluster, and about 12 clusters across the globe, and don't have any issues with having to track down ports
39 [2016-12-29T17:05:47] <galvesribeiro> the problem is that the 1. Server app need to know the port and IP it will bind to so it can write it to membership table. 2. the client read this data from that table so it WILL need IP and PORT each silo is running
40 [2016-12-29T17:05:50] <galvesribeiro> trust me
41 [2016-12-29T17:05:53] <killerspaz> so when you spin up your deployment, you're manually runningdocker runlines?
42 [2016-12-29T17:05:55] <galvesribeiro> the application NEED that
43 [2016-12-29T17:06:02] <killerspaz> no dude, docker has all that built in natively
44 [2016-12-29T17:06:07] <galvesribeiro> :(
45 [2016-12-29T17:06:08] <killerspaz> you don't need to know IPs at all
46 [2016-12-29T17:06:24] <galvesribeiro> you are not understanding :(
47 [2016-12-29T17:07:04] <killerspaz> so maybe you can elaborate a bit? Because I'm still not seeing the issue other than your understanding of docker/compose
48 [2016-12-29T17:07:19] <galvesribeiro> ok... let me try again
49 [2016-12-29T17:07:36] <galvesribeiro> regardless of how docker manage dns resolution and port binding
50 [2016-12-29T17:08:00] <galvesribeiro> the server application needs to know which IP:PORT it will listen to and write to the membership store tables
51 [2016-12-29T17:08:02] <galvesribeiro> got it?
52 [2016-12-29T17:08:04] <galvesribeiro> now
53 [2016-12-29T17:08:24] <killerspaz> i'm pretty certain I understand what you're trying to do
54 [2016-12-29T17:08:28] <galvesribeiro> the client which will read from the membership table will need to be able to reach IP:PORT
55 [2016-12-29T17:08:28] <killerspaz> you're basically building a mesh
56 [2016-12-29T17:08:34] <killerspaz> an explicit mesh
57 [2016-12-29T17:08:40] <galvesribeiro> it is a Distributed Hash Table
58 [2016-12-29T17:08:45] <killerspaz> which i'm telling you is redundant because docker has that native
59 [2016-12-29T17:08:47] <galvesribeiro> that manages membership of the cluster
60 [2016-12-29T17:09:02] <galvesribeiro> ok...
61 [2016-12-29T17:09:03] <galvesribeiro> so
62 [2016-12-29T17:09:03] <killerspaz> answer this, are you ever runningdocker runoutside of running unit tests?
63 [2016-12-29T17:09:22] <galvesribeiro> for the local tests I'm using docker run
64 [2016-12-29T17:09:33] <galvesribeiro> but I plan to learn and use compose to make it production soon
65 [2016-12-29T17:09:50] <killerspaz> i'd get that going immediately, you'll see it works all that out really quick
66 [2016-12-29T17:10:05] <galvesribeiro> it wont
67 [2016-12-29T17:10:45] <galvesribeiro> the cluster althought they are running the same image, when each machin join the cluster it join the DHT which makes it handle specific part of the messages
68 [2016-12-29T17:11:07] <galvesribeiro> it is not like a web server that you can reach a service or DNS name that will be round robin balanced to any server
69 [2016-12-29T17:11:32] <galvesribeiro> the client (based on that membership table) will need to connect specifically for a given silo/server to do specific stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T16:49:18] <killerspaz> well the beauty of docker is that ports don't matter in the end, everything is routed through a subnet from different hosts when using docker compose
2 [2016-12-29T16:49:36] <killerspaz> i have every service running on the same port, and map to different ports to host should I need access
3 [2016-12-29T16:50:04] <killerspaz> but cross-container's all access byhostname:COMMON_PORT
4 [2016-12-29T17:00:16] <killerspaz> explain more, because I have very complicated distributed clusters
5 [2016-12-29T17:00:20] <killerspaz> and don't have this problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T17:11:23] <killerspaz> you supply services, which docker-compose will institute hostnames as the same name, then ports you can just keep constant, and access viaservice_A:1024,service_B:1024,some_mongo_instance:27017(if using default mongo images with default ports)
2 [2016-12-29T17:11:33] <killerspaz> docker compose IS a dns
3 [2016-12-29T17:11:41] <killerspaz> ... effectively
4 [2016-12-29T17:12:22] <galvesribeiro> ok, but institute default port will make 2 conatiners to run in the same host
5 [2016-12-29T17:12:32] <killerspaz> mm no
6 [2016-12-29T17:12:37] <killerspaz> that's already bad construction of containers
7 [2016-12-29T17:12:46] <killerspaz> they should be separate containers
8 [2016-12-29T17:13:01] <killerspaz> mongo_users, mongo_logs, mongo_whatever
9 [2016-12-29T17:13:13] <killerspaz> not just "mongo" and all your dbs are in that container
10 [2016-12-29T17:13:34] <galvesribeiro> :(
11 [2016-12-29T17:13:39] <galvesribeiro> you still don't undertand  my problem
12 [2016-12-29T17:13:40] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
13 [2016-12-29T17:13:51] <galvesribeiro> you deal as it was a regular web app
14 [2016-12-29T17:13:54] <galvesribeiro> but it is not
15 [2016-12-29T17:14:00] <galvesribeiro> it is really a distributed cluster
16 [2016-12-29T17:14:15] <galvesribeiro> and I may have multiples clusters running on the same machine
17 [2016-12-29T17:14:26] <galvesribeiro> and if I specify a given port they will not be able to run
18 [2016-12-29T17:14:58] <killerspaz> your clusters should be subnetted
19 [2016-12-29T17:15:10] <killerspaz> and on different hostnames
20 [2016-12-29T17:15:16] <galvesribeiro> why?
21 [2016-12-29T17:15:26] <killerspaz> because best practices
22 [2016-12-29T17:15:31] <killerspaz> for this reason exactly
23 [2016-12-29T17:15:41] <killerspaz> you avoid port collission
24 [2016-12-29T17:15:42] <galvesribeiro> I want have multiple a pool of container host machines
25 [2016-12-29T17:15:52] <galvesribeiro> and just spin containers in them
26 [2016-12-29T17:15:56] <galvesribeiro> and ask them to just run
27 [2016-12-29T17:16:01] <galvesribeiro> that is what I do today with VMs
28 [2016-12-29T17:16:33] <killerspaz> thus, began docker compose
29 [2016-12-29T17:16:50] <killerspaz> it does all the subnet and iptable routing for you
30 [2016-12-29T17:17:00] <galvesribeiro> I already have a notion of what compose does and it don't solve my problem
31 [2016-12-29T17:17:29] <galvesribeiro> because (again) load balancing is not what I'm looking for...
32 [2016-12-29T17:17:29] <killerspaz> I think you're trying to over complicate it, honestly.... Not sure what Orleans is for exactly, but it's redundant imo.
33 [2016-12-29T17:17:37] <killerspaz> i'm not talking about load balancing
34 [2016-12-29T17:17:51] <killerspaz> i'm talking about host and port resolution
35 [2016-12-29T17:17:55] <galvesribeiro> ok, so tell me one thing...
36 [2016-12-29T17:18:09] <galvesribeiro> does docker has service discovery?
37 [2016-12-29T17:18:14] <killerspaz> yes
38 [2016-12-29T17:18:18] <galvesribeiro> ok, how?
39 [2016-12-29T17:18:25] <killerspaz> through hostnames via docker-compose
40 [2016-12-29T17:18:27] <galvesribeiro> service discovery != DNS resolution
41 [2016-12-29T17:19:01] <killerspaz> it effectively is though; [<-LINK->]
42 [2016-12-29T17:19:11] <killerspaz> docker cloud uses docker compose to create the mesh
43 [2016-12-29T17:19:49] <killerspaz> compltely via hostname, which is the same as the service name
44 [2016-12-29T17:19:50] <galvesribeiro> service discovery is not just hostnames or DNSs... it is service name (maybe it can be the hostname in case of single node service) plus port
45 [2016-12-29T17:20:07] <galvesribeiro> links only add HOSTNAME to the machines
46 [2016-12-29T17:20:11] <galvesribeiro> not service discovery
47 [2016-12-29T17:21:19] <galvesribeiro> ok, let me ask something else
48 [2016-12-29T17:21:50] <killerspaz> in traditional service discovery you'd absolutely need the port like you're doing, but i'm saying with docker/kubernetes/etc you do not. The SWARM clusters figure all the routing between subnets for you, and you simply access viaremote_hostname:whatever_port_you_run_inside_container
49 [2016-12-29T17:22:34] <killerspaz> I don't believe that's a valid use-case with docker
50 [2016-12-29T17:22:41] <killerspaz> except for health monitoring maybe
51 [2016-12-29T17:22:50] <killerspaz> but even still, IoC would work better
52 [2016-12-29T17:23:57] <killerspaz> i would say in my app "nc servicename:port` and connect and be done... I dont\' care which of the 20 cloned containers it is, the swarm handles that for me routing to an existing container
53 [2016-12-29T17:24:12] <killerspaz> it's service discovery in the sense that you can access services simply, without having to LOOK them up first.
54 [2016-12-29T17:24:55] <killerspaz> ok, but why?
55 [2016-12-29T17:25:02] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
56 [2016-12-29T17:25:05] <killerspaz> I can accept that, just need to understand why
57 [2016-12-29T17:25:28] <killerspaz> ignoring orleans atm, what is the actual business case for this
58 [2016-12-29T17:25:44] <killerspaz> simply because you WANT to use Orleans?
59 [2016-12-29T17:26:36] <killerspaz> I'm just trying to understand why out of 20 cloned containers you need any one specific one
60 [2016-12-29T17:26:57] <dragon788> galvesribeiro: I hope you plan on getting your PhD, because most Microsoft tools require that in order to use them
61 [2016-12-29T17:27:29] <dragon788> the problem is microsoft always ignores existing implementations like etcd/consul/etc and invents their own way of doing things, typically ignoring the existing work done and the pitfalls that have been encountered and worked around
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T17:21:57] <galvesribeiro> is there a way for my client containers to query "hey docker, what are the conainters running the Image XXXX and what are their published port" ?
2 [2016-12-29T17:22:48] <galvesribeiro> ok, then it doesn't have service discovery :D
3 [2016-12-29T17:24:14] <galvesribeiro> the point is, when my server start, it need to say tosomething"hey I\'m listening on port XXXX and my resolvable hostname is YYYY", then the client will query this same "something" for all the available services
4 [2016-12-29T17:24:42] <galvesribeiro> I dont' care which of the 20 cloned containers it isThat is the problem... We DO care about which container we are connecting to
5 [2016-12-29T17:25:28] <galvesribeiro> because of the membership protocol and the DHT which distribute what and where some actions will happen in Orleans
6 [2016-12-29T17:26:35] <galvesribeiro> no, because I USE Orleans and that is proven piece of tech created by multiple PhDs in Distributed Computing and host huge distributed services like Halo game, Skype, and multiple others
7 [2016-12-29T17:26:41] <galvesribeiro> so trust me, they know what they are doing
8 [2016-12-29T17:27:11] <killerspaz> Not saying they don't, but there's other ways to accomplish the same thing that I think are easier
9 [2016-12-29T17:27:27] <galvesribeiro> because 1 of the actors (the processing unit in Orleans) that I'm interested in is inside that give specific container
10 [2016-12-29T17:27:28] <killerspaz> but i'm not fully understanding your need
11 [2016-12-29T17:27:52] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: Orleans works perfectly with Consul, Zookeeper and other membership providers
12 [2016-12-29T17:27:57] <killerspaz> so they aren't 20 cloned containers in your example then, right? they'd actually be unique containers?
13 [2016-12-29T17:28:19] <killerspaz> conatiner 1 does something completely different than container 2?
14 [2016-12-29T17:28:21] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: if you read the link I pasted it mention that... so MS don't ignore anything
15 [2016-12-29T17:28:34] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: the OS, Frameworks, APP, they are the same, cloned
16 [2016-12-29T17:28:46] <galvesribeiro> they just process part of the workload individually
17 [2016-12-29T17:28:56] <killerspaz> so why would one act differently than the other?
18 [2016-12-29T17:28:56] <galvesribeiro> the Actors are balanced between the cluster
19 [2016-12-29T17:29:08] <galvesribeiro> they don't act diff then another
20 [2016-12-29T17:29:14] <killerspaz> so each container can POTENTIALLY do n-actions?
21 [2016-12-29T17:29:26] <killerspaz> all as first-class citizens?
22 [2016-12-29T17:29:29] <galvesribeiro> its hard to explain...
23 [2016-12-29T17:29:35] <killerspaz> lol sounds like it :P
24 [2016-12-29T17:29:35] <galvesribeiro> do you know the Actor model?
25 [2016-12-29T17:29:38] <killerspaz> yes
26 [2016-12-29T17:29:40] <galvesribeiro> ok
27 [2016-12-29T17:29:48] <galvesribeiro> in Orleans a cluster is a pool of machines
28 [2016-12-29T17:29:53] <galvesribeiro> that have same code running
29 [2016-12-29T17:30:15] <galvesribeiro> the 1 actor instance can be activated anywhere in the cluster
30 [2016-12-29T17:30:33] <galvesribeiro> in this case on any of container being part of the cluster
31 [2016-12-29T17:30:35] <galvesribeiro> so
32 [2016-12-29T17:30:43] <galvesribeiro> assuming that I have 2 containers in the cluster
33 [2016-12-29T17:31:02] <killerspaz> so key phrase i\'m reading is "any of container"
34 [2016-12-29T17:31:11] <galvesribeiro> one request comes and activate ActorA on containerA and another comes and activate ActorB in containerB
35 [2016-12-29T17:31:20] <killerspaz> which means you do not need to know which one, just A container that can do what you need
36 [2016-12-29T17:31:42] <killerspaz> ok, that is load balancing
37 [2016-12-29T17:31:44] <galvesribeiro> so while the actors are in memory,  when the client needs to talk to the ActorB it MUST connect directly to containerB
38 [2016-12-29T17:32:02] <killerspaz> sure
39 [2016-12-29T17:32:03] <galvesribeiro> the actor balancing and placement is an internal behavior of Orleans
40 [2016-12-29T17:32:15] <galvesribeiro> not a regular web/tcp NLB thing
41 [2016-12-29T17:32:37] <killerspaz> I can't help you with Orleans, at all... But again, it sounds heavily redundant based on docker technology
42 [2016-12-29T17:32:41] <galvesribeiro> and the client figure out where that specific activation is based on that membership table and an activation catalog
43 [2016-12-29T17:32:54] <galvesribeiro> Orleans is ortogonal
44 [2016-12-29T17:32:57] <galvesribeiro> to any of this
45 [2016-12-29T17:33:00] <galvesribeiro> like I said
46 [2016-12-29T17:33:04] <killerspaz> that's the point though
47 [2016-12-29T17:33:16] <galvesribeiro> I can create a Membership provider that uses Docker infrastructure
48 [2016-12-29T17:33:38] <galvesribeiro> just like we did for SQL, Zookeeper, Paxus, etcd, Consul and many other service discovery mechanisms
49 [2016-12-29T17:33:56] <killerspaz> except you can't, because you don't know your ip/port?
50 [2016-12-29T17:34:08] <galvesribeiro> so, in order to create that membership provider in Orleans, I need to know where I can query for my containers
51 [2016-12-29T17:34:26] <killerspaz> i dunno, i have tons of jobs that distribute across multiple clusters and sync across th eworld... i've never had to concern myself with discovery when using docker
52 [2016-12-29T17:34:56] <galvesribeiro> because you use regular balancing stuff... like DNS  :)
53 [2016-12-29T17:35:10] <killerspaz> i hit a load balancer, it directs to a container i need, done.... but i always access via hostname. if a container needs to be spun up, it spins up, shuts down when done.
54 [2016-12-29T17:35:13] <galvesribeiro> which is perfect for Web and basic request/response stateless services
55 [2016-12-29T17:35:22] <galvesribeiro> yeah, because they are stateless
56 [2016-12-29T17:35:25] <killerspaz> i don't care which of the 1000 physical bare metal boxes it starts on
57 [2016-12-29T17:35:35] <galvesribeiro> yes! because they are stateless :P
58 [2016-12-29T17:35:48] <killerspaz> lol now we're about to get into more wars :P
59 [2016-12-29T17:35:54] <galvesribeiro> heheheheheh
60 [2016-12-29T17:36:29] <killerspaz> I believe in stateless design; containers are meant to be ephemeral
61 [2016-12-29T17:36:43] <galvesribeiro> that issue you first posted is precisely why we need that and tons of people replied with +1 3years ago
62 [2016-12-29T17:36:53] <galvesribeiro> and they do in Orleans
63 [2016-12-29T17:36:59] <galvesribeiro> if one container is destroyed
64 [2016-12-29T17:37:01] <galvesribeiro> no problem
65 [2016-12-29T17:37:20] <galvesribeiro> the state is persisted and if someone ask for that actor again, it is activated on another server
66 [2016-12-29T17:38:17] <killerspaz> could you possibly netstat and get the port by process?
67 [2016-12-29T17:38:49] <galvesribeiro> you mean the client netstat the container host?
68 [2016-12-29T17:39:00] <killerspaz> inside the container itself
69 [2016-12-29T17:39:06] <killerspaz> to register it to the Membership Table
70 [2016-12-29T17:39:16] <galvesribeiro> it does it today
71 [2016-12-29T17:39:23] <galvesribeiro> I mean
72 [2016-12-29T17:40:46] <galvesribeiro> when starting a Orleans silo, and has a membership provider configured, it will get that port and IP and write to the membership table
73 [2016-12-29T17:40:53] <galvesribeiro> that is regardless of docker or whatever
74 [2016-12-29T17:41:00] <galvesribeiro> the problem is not the silo
75 [2016-12-29T17:41:20] <galvesribeiro> the image will do aEXPOSE xxxxso all containers internally expose the same port
76 [2016-12-29T17:41:27] <galvesribeiro> that is OK so fa
77 [2016-12-29T17:41:28] <galvesribeiro> far
78 [2016-12-29T17:41:42] <killerspaz> you don't need EXPOSE though
79 [2016-12-29T17:41:45] <killerspaz> with compose
80 [2016-12-29T17:41:47] <galvesribeiro> humm
81 [2016-12-29T17:41:51] <galvesribeiro> ok
82 [2016-12-29T17:41:54] <galvesribeiro> so ignoring expose
83 [2016-12-29T17:42:07] <galvesribeiro> the app start and write down its port to the membership
84 [2016-12-29T17:42:30] <galvesribeiro> next step is the client read the membership table, get the IP and PORT of all silos alive
85 [2016-12-29T17:42:39] <galvesribeiro> and connect to each one of them on that port
86 [2016-12-29T17:42:59] <killerspaz> so is it possible to run all members on the same port if they were different hosts?
87 [2016-12-29T17:43:04] <killerspaz> or is it mandatory to be arbitrary?
88 [2016-12-29T17:43:51] <galvesribeiro> you mean make all them with-p sameexposedport:someinternalporton all the containers assuming only 1 is running on that same host?
89 [2016-12-29T17:46:13] <killerspaz> here's an example of my docker-compose.yml: [<-LINK->]
90 [2016-12-29T17:46:34] <killerspaz> inside the container, the app spins up some service.. in the case of mongo, they all start on port 27017
91 [2016-12-29T17:46:45] <killerspaz> but i don't define that, mongo does... i COULD with an ENV var, but I don't
92 [2016-12-29T17:46:59] <killerspaz> however, all my other containers can access mongo_user:27017 without issue
93 [2016-12-29T17:47:11] <killerspaz> and mongo itself can load balance to it's own cluster/shards/etc
94 [2016-12-29T17:47:51] <killerspaz> as for the bottom oneapi.user, that's a nginx load balancer with knowledge of all the associative services. it's the ONLY container exposed in this example.
95 [2016-12-29T17:48:01] <killerspaz> so external services can contact this cluster
96 [2016-12-29T17:49:03] <killerspaz> but i can just access viawget api.userfrom any container
97 [2016-12-29T17:49:09] <killerspaz> ANY container
98 [2016-12-29T17:49:21] <killerspaz> or vice versa,mongo_users
99 [2016-12-29T17:49:35] <galvesribeiro> yeah, pretty clean 3-tier web architecture
100 [2016-12-29T17:49:44] <killerspaz> that's just a snippet of the 50+ that are in there
101 [2016-12-29T17:50:02] <killerspaz> and only 1 cluster type
102 [2016-12-29T17:50:04] <galvesribeiro> which is very different from what we do
103 [2016-12-29T17:50:42] <killerspaz> afaiac, that's how docker is meant to be used
104 [2016-12-29T17:51:02] <galvesribeiro> yeah that is what I meant in the first place :)
105 [2016-12-29T17:51:17] <galvesribeiro> docker is easy and really good for simple web applications which mostly are 3-tier apps
106 [2016-12-29T17:51:45] <galvesribeiro> when you have something complex like actor frameworks and DHT scenarios you have this problem
107 [2016-12-29T17:51:53] <galvesribeiro> it is not just Orleans
108 [2016-12-29T17:51:54] <galvesribeiro> I mean
109 [2016-12-29T17:52:03] <galvesribeiro> Erlang, Akka, they all would have the same issue
110 [2016-12-29T17:52:26] <galvesribeiro> because they all agree on some membership protocol mostly based on DHTs
111 [2016-12-29T17:53:16] <killerspaz> and i would never use those with a container system, personally
112 [2016-12-29T17:53:35] <galvesribeiro> that is the point, they are really good fit for containers
113 [2016-12-29T17:53:43] <killerspaz> most modern message systems use SWIM algorithm to avoid this
114 [2016-12-29T17:53:50] <galvesribeiro> ???
115 [2016-12-29T17:54:00] <galvesribeiro> modern, you mean web :)
116 [2016-12-29T17:54:08] <killerspaz> anything within the last 10 years
117 [2016-12-29T17:54:25] <killerspaz> look at how netflix does their stuff... i can guarantee it's more complex that yours and mine combined :P
118 [2016-12-29T17:54:58] <galvesribeiro> netflix is a streaming service which is 90% of their work focused on web apps :D
119 [2016-12-29T17:55:06] <killerspaz> not even close
120 [2016-12-29T17:55:16] <galvesribeiro> there is nothing about distributed computing for netflix :D
121 [2016-12-29T17:55:21] <galvesribeiro> they just, stream stuff
122 [2016-12-29T17:55:21] <killerspaz> LOL ok
123 [2016-12-29T17:55:31] <galvesribeiro> I did an interview with them here :)
124 [2016-12-29T17:55:33] <killerspaz> that's not remotely true
125 [2016-12-29T17:55:43] <galvesribeiro> not saying that they are crap
126 [2016-12-29T17:55:44] <galvesribeiro> they are amazing
127 [2016-12-29T17:55:50] <galvesribeiro> but it is something focused on web
128 [2016-12-29T17:55:57] <galvesribeiro> not even close to distributed computing or actors
129 [2016-12-29T17:56:24] <galvesribeiro> they dont have concurrency and other problems that distributed computing propose to handle
130 [2016-12-29T17:56:25] <galvesribeiro> anyway
131 [2016-12-29T17:56:30] <galvesribeiro> lets not bloat the chat with it
132 [2016-12-29T17:56:36] <killerspaz> lol they most certainly do
133 [2016-12-29T17:56:59] <galvesribeiro> I just need to figure out a way to create a membership provider for docker
134 [2016-12-29T17:57:06] <galvesribeiro> to give an Idea
135 [2016-12-29T17:57:14] <galvesribeiro> do you know Service Fabric?
136 [2016-12-29T17:58:18] <galvesribeiro> they have a internal "Naming Service" which is basically a service discovery service... so Orleans run perfectly in it... we created a provider that register the silos in this service, and the client ask about the service there
137 [2016-12-29T17:58:20] <killerspaz> i'm familiar, but never used it
138 [2016-12-29T17:58:41] <galvesribeiro> so the "Membership Table" is just a concept, which can be implemented anywhere as long as we follow the protocol
139 [2016-12-29T17:58:46] <galvesribeiro> so SF just works
140 [2016-12-29T17:59:03] <killerspaz> and how do you define the internal names
141 [2016-12-29T17:59:19] <galvesribeiro> the same way as Consul and Zookeeper which are K/V dictionary repo
142 [2016-12-29T17:59:22] <galvesribeiro> internal names?
143 [2016-12-29T17:59:38] <killerspaz> they have a internal "Naming Service" which is basically a service discovery service
144 [2016-12-29T18:00:03] <killerspaz> so when you want to discover, do you have to use some randomly generated names, or do you provide them
145 [2016-12-29T18:00:53] <killerspaz> SF is to Azure as Docker Swarm is to Docker
146 [2016-12-29T18:01:28] <galvesribeiro> I ask them for ALL the silos in naming service, connect to 1 of them first time, get a list of the Actors activation and later on, based on which actor I want to connect, I specifically connect to that server
147 [2016-12-29T18:01:42] <galvesribeiro> not exactly
148 [2016-12-29T18:02:08] <galvesribeiro> when you use swarm there is a notion of service
149 [2016-12-29T18:02:34] <galvesribeiro> which you client try to connect to it, and it forward to any of the thousands of containers listen on diff internal ports
150 [2016-12-29T18:02:42] <galvesribeiro> this is basically DNS with port forwarding
151 [2016-12-29T18:03:01] <killerspaz> no, you have each docker daemon join the swarm (aka DHT)
152 [2016-12-29T18:03:08] <killerspaz> there's no routing, it's explicit
153 [2016-12-29T18:03:28] <galvesribeiro> yes they join and form a swarm cluster I understand that
154 [2016-12-29T18:03:42] <killerspaz> which is what you're trying to accomplish with Orleans from my understanding
155 [2016-12-29T18:03:54] <galvesribeiro> Orleans already do that
156 [2016-12-29T18:03:55] <galvesribeiro> but
157 [2016-12-29T18:03:59] <galvesribeiro> like I said
158 [2016-12-29T18:04:01] <galvesribeiro> it is plugable
159 [2016-12-29T18:04:29] <galvesribeiro> so if I can query Swarm I can create a provider for it :D
160 [2016-12-29T18:04:47] <killerspaz> and what would this provider do?
161 [2016-12-29T18:05:42] <killerspaz> i just can't understand a reason i'd ever want to access a single container explicitly. Sounds entirely cumbersome.
162 [2016-12-29T18:06:21] <galvesribeiro> if you understand actors there is multiple reasons for that
163 [2016-12-29T18:06:37] <galvesribeiro> but the location of the actor is transparent for the developer
164 [2016-12-29T18:06:40] <galvesribeiro> it "Just run"
165 [2016-12-29T18:06:50] <galvesribeiro> the framework internally needs to understand that
166 [2016-12-29T18:07:16] <galvesribeiro> at the server/silo side the provider, register all servers in swarm... as far as I understood, docker already register the containers on swarm as part of a service, good, so no change at all at server
167 [2016-12-29T18:07:52] <galvesribeiro> so in the client, when it start, the provider must query something to get a list of silos in that cluster that are alive
168 [2016-12-29T18:08:40] <galvesribeiro> and then when it needs to send a message to a specific actor in a specific server you will connect to that specific silo
169 [2016-12-29T18:09:36] <galvesribeiro> the load balancing of an actor in Orleans is extremely efficient and beat by far NLB algorithms and reverse proxies
170 [2016-12-29T18:14:27] <galvesribeiro> but@killerspazdo you think if there is a chance to find what I want, docker swarm docs is the write guy to look for it, right?
171 [2016-12-29T18:15:12] <killerspaz> yes, in conjunction with docker compose
172 [2016-12-29T18:15:15] <killerspaz> imo
173 [2016-12-29T18:15:21] <killerspaz> unless anyone else has any other input
174 [2016-12-29T18:15:32] <galvesribeiro> ok thank you, really appreciate the help
175 [2016-12-29T18:15:36] <killerspaz> i wouldn't call myself an expert, but I've just never needed to do what you're trying
176 [2016-12-29T18:15:38] <galvesribeiro> will have a look on both deeper
177 [2016-12-29T18:15:50] <killerspaz> and i have concurrent systems all over the place
178 [2016-12-29T18:16:02] <killerspaz> let me rephrase... i haven't had the need since using docker
179 [2016-12-29T18:16:32] <killerspaz> and i'm using SWIM technologies to simplify the DHT issues you're having
180 [2016-12-29T18:17:14] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
181 [2016-12-29T18:17:41] <galvesribeiro> that is my point, if docker handle somehow service discovery, I would be more than happy to use it and plug it on docker by a provider
182 [2016-12-29T18:17:47] <galvesribeiro> yeah I know SWIM
183 [2016-12-29T18:18:02] <galvesribeiro> it is another variation of PAXOS
184 [2016-12-29T18:18:23] <killerspaz> we're currently using pattern matching for identifying the node we need to discover, but that's all behind the scenes
185 [2016-12-29T18:19:35] <killerspaz> so i can send a message in json format if i want like:{ actor: 'User', action: 'sync'}and every node that supports thath command is told to sync, and they are queued into rabbitMQ in batches, then another job that was also listening for the same pattern processes the queue
186 [2016-12-29T18:19:41] <killerspaz> ... for example.
187 [2016-12-29T18:19:58] <galvesribeiro> yeah but that is just a pub/sub mechanism
188 [2016-12-29T18:20:32] <killerspaz> mmm not exactly, it MUST exist
189 [2016-12-29T18:20:49] <killerspaz> the SWIM impl uses the pattern to do service discovery
190 [2016-12-29T18:21:02] <killerspaz> which services support this
191 [2016-12-29T18:21:05] <killerspaz> THEN it messages them
192 [2016-12-29T18:21:11] <killerspaz> it's very similar to akka actually
193 [2016-12-29T18:21:21] <galvesribeiro> ok
194 [2016-12-29T18:21:31] <killerspaz> only i don't need elasticsearch
195 [2016-12-29T18:21:32] <galvesribeiro> its hard to wrap around our heads on actors... I had a hard time first some years ago... then I found Orleans after I leave MSFT
196 [2016-12-29T18:21:44] <galvesribeiro> Akka and Erlang is so limited
197 [2016-12-29T18:22:31] <galvesribeiro> you as a developer in Erlang or Akka, need to instantiate an actor and put it on a specific place in the cluster
198 [2016-12-29T18:22:36] <galvesribeiro> in orleans you don't do that
199 [2016-12-29T18:23:24] <galvesribeiro> you get a reference without knowing where the actor is running and call a regular method... that method call is shipped internally to the right silo in the cluster and you will receive the response
200 [2016-12-29T18:23:38] <galvesribeiro> exceptions are propagated across all nodes etc
201 [2016-12-29T18:23:39] <galvesribeiro> anyway
202 [2016-12-29T18:24:06] <galvesribeiro> a very modern (and easy) way to make distribute cloud apps
203 [2016-12-29T18:27:46] <killerspaz> I've been out of the microsoft world for a bit, other than OS.
204 [2016-12-29T18:27:56] <killerspaz> not by choice, just how things worked out
205 [2016-12-29T18:31:01] <galvesribeiro> Ic
206 [2016-12-29T18:31:04] <galvesribeiro>  [<-ISSUE->]
207 [2016-12-29T18:31:22] <galvesribeiro> This issue proposes an introspection rest api just as AWS does
208 [2016-12-29T18:31:36] <galvesribeiro> That would give me the information I need
209 [2016-12-29T19:36:08] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: there are two roles here
210 [2016-12-29T19:36:26] <galvesribeiro> I as an application developer which use Orleans dont need to care about it
211 [2016-12-29T19:37:25] <galvesribeiro> But I as an Orleans maintainer which is trying to make Orleans to run on container needs to know and implement it. Because behind the scenes the framework uses it
212 [2016-12-29T19:47:13] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: it doesnt matter actually. It is just a general suggestion. Zookeeper is just one of many membership providers supported
213 [2016-12-29T19:47:42] <galvesribeiro> But I'm runnin on azure VMs with windows containers in it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T19:17:55] <dragon788> in orleans you don't do thatyou get a reference without knowing where the actor is running and call a regular method... that method call is shipped internally to the right silo in the cluster and you will receive the response
2 [2016-12-29T19:18:11] <dragon788> this is what is confusing me, why do you need to find/call the actor yourself if your framework handles that?
3 [2016-12-29T19:20:24] <dragon788> in your example if Client B talks to Container B and initiates a session, you just need to ensure that session persists between B and B, not add the ridiculous complexity of pulling out all this information from the containers and discovering the overall topology of the entire cluster, that way lies madness
4 [2016-12-29T19:20:48] <dragon788> it sounds like you are defeating the purpose of Orleans if you are doing all this extra work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T19:42:25] <dragon788> are you running this in house or on a cloud hosting solution? reading the Orleans whitepaper they recommend using Zookeeper if in house, or Azure Tables/SQL if elsewhere
2 [2016-12-29T19:47:56] <dragon788> agreed, but Zookeeper/Consul/etc will all solve this for your containers, so what is preventing you from using those or Azure Tables as your MemberShipPool?
3 [2016-12-29T19:48:01] <dragon788> or registry or whatever
4 [2016-12-29T19:48:20] <galvesribeiro> But even if I use zookeeper it will not fix my issue
5 [2016-12-29T19:48:28] <galvesribeiro> Neither consul or whatever registry
6 [2016-12-29T19:49:12] <dragon788> I think you are overthinking this
7 [2016-12-29T19:49:53] <dragon788> I'd just give it a try using Azure Tables or whatever, then if it does not work, you have exhausted the possibility, if you haven't tried it and are just assuming it won't work, then it is hard to suggest alternatives
8 [2016-12-29T19:50:09] <galvesribeiro> The problem is by the time my orleans silo  app is installing, it need to know which port it is using so it write it to membership table
9 [2016-12-29T19:50:18] <galvesribeiro> Or zookeeper or consul or whatever
10 [2016-12-29T19:50:34] <galvesribeiro> I already have orleans on several production apps
11 [2016-12-29T19:50:42] <galvesribeiro> Just jot in containers
12 [2016-12-29T19:51:12] <galvesribeiro> Installinng I meant starting (sorry on mobile now)
13 [2016-12-29T20:09:24] <galvesribeiro> Looks like registrator keeps pooling docker APIs to check the containers there and register them...
14 [2016-12-29T20:11:45] <galvesribeiro> I may have an idea :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-29T20:16:11] <galvesribeiro> From inside a container can I access the host ip machine (on docker virtual network) so I can make requests to dockerd REST api?
2 [2016-12-29T22:38:06] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: /@killerspaz?
3 [2016-12-29T22:39:54] <dragon788> yeah
4 [2016-12-29T22:40:21] <dragon788> the host may exist on the docker network depending on what options you run a container with
5 [2016-12-29T22:40:31] <dragon788> a lot of it is designed for isolation, but you can bypass that
6 [2016-12-29T22:41:41] <dragon788> or you could mount the docker socket into a specific container and present the REST api on the docker network, though security wise that is frowned upon
7 [2016-12-29T22:42:30] <galvesribeiro> Yeah I see an IP on the host that is on the container network and inside the container this very same IP is its gateway
8 [2016-12-29T22:42:52] <galvesribeiro> I cant use the socket hack because it is linux specific
9 [2016-12-29T22:42:58] <galvesribeiro> Windows doesnt have it
10 [2016-12-29T22:45:15] <dragon788> ahhh yeah, poor Windows :)
11 [2016-12-29T22:45:26] <galvesribeiro> Hehehe
12 [2016-12-29T22:45:28] <galvesribeiro> Yeah
13 [2016-12-29T22:45:44] <galvesribeiro> Anyway
14 [2016-12-29T22:46:05] <galvesribeiro> Will try this docker api workaround and see what I can found
15 [2016-12-29T22:46:35] <galvesribeiro> Maybe I can create a Orleans MEmbership provider who talks to docker api and query for the containers running orleans
16 [2016-12-29T22:46:41] <galvesribeiro> Will see
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-30T03:58:54] <josephgardner> I\'m trying to run a docker image on a windows server VM, and the service crashes when trying to pull the image "unexpected EOF" If I try to restart the docker service, I get a 1067 error
2 [2016-12-30T03:59:06] <josephgardner> Is there an issue related to this, or am I doing something wrong?
3 [2016-12-31T03:44:37] <josephgardner> dragon788: I created issue # [<-ISSUE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-30T10:34:22] <obernardovieira> I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that. Until there, I will be using docker on a virtual machine, because I cant trust this software anymore.
2 [2016-12-30T12:03:14] <Forecaster> "Fix that."
3 [2016-12-30T12:03:18] <Forecaster> great feedback
4 [2016-12-30T22:14:57] <obernardovieira> dragon788: doenst make any sense, because after I restart my computer, the disk free space keeps decreasing

1 [2016-12-30T13:13:34] <kkarolis> Hey, is it normal behaviour that memory footprint of processes running in docker container are not visible on the host? I.e. when I run 10 containers where each consumes 400MiB of space(reported by docker stats), host machines /proc/meminfo:MemoryAvailable stays mostly the same.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2016-12-30T21:01:13] <dragon788> are they the same container? the kernel is pretty smart about shared vs isolated memory and if it is the same basic runspace it could be the majority of that is being reused between the containers unless you launched with some special cgroup magic to force isolation
2 [2016-12-30T21:02:10] <dragon788> obernardovieira: it sounds like you performed adocker pull somehugerepositoryinstead of adocker pull somehugerepository:specifictagand ended up filling your disk
3 [2016-12-30T21:02:58] <dragon788> josephgardner: Windows Server 2016 VM on Hyper-V or something else?
4 [2016-12-30T22:16:56] <dragon788> if you look at the disk space being used, what directory is the most full? you can use the Disk Usage Analyzer tool if that is installed

2 [2017-01-02T22:45:34] <mmisztal1980> is there something I need to add atdocker-machine createstage?
3 [2017-01-02T22:46:36] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgI could be mistaken, but this might be a question regarding where you're running docker-machine from, ie, what does /etc/resolv.conf look like (for starters)?
4 [2017-01-02T22:48:53] <mmisztal1980> it appears that the file is present at/etc/resolv.confbut it's empty
5 [2017-01-02T22:49:23] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.organd no local DNS server (eg, BIND) running...?
6 [2017-01-02T22:49:29] <mmisztal1980> I'm using docker for windows, so basically it starts aboot2dockerinstance in hyper-v
7 [2017-01-02T22:49:33] <mmisztal1980> nope
8 [2017-01-02T22:49:46] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgless familiar with that, but we should be able to make do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-03T14:25:07] <SISheogorath> @siassaj keep it small, add multithreaded/processed builds (like using make with -j)depending on your usecase add more layers.For dev images check for example the node:*-onbuild images which are really nice with their dep caching.For production images you should keep the number of layers as small as possible.

1 [2017-01-04T16:01:26] <Husamuddin> hello thereI have a problem to stop/kill containers on dockerit says: [<-CODE->] I'm on ubuntu 16.04here is my kernel version: 4.4.0-57-genericand docker version:Client: Version:      1.12.5 API version:  1.24 Go version:   go1.6.4 Git commit:   7392c3b Built:        Fri Dec 16 02:42:17 2016 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64Server:  Version:      1.12.5  API version:  1.24  Go version:   go1.6.4  Git commit:   7392c3b  Built:        Fri Dec 16 02:42:17 2016  OS/Arch:      linux/amd64and docker info:Containers: 1 Running: 1 Paused: 0 Stopped: 0 Images: 11 Server Version: 1.12.5 Storage Driver: aufs Root Dir: /var/lib/docker/aufs Backing Filesystem: extfs Dirs: 16 Dirperm1 Supported: true Logging Driver: json-file Cgroup Driver: cgroupfsPlugins:Volume: local Network: bridge null overlay host Swarm: inactive Runtimes: runc Default Runtime: runc Security Options: apparmor seccomp Kernel Version: 4.4.0-57-generic Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS OSType: linux Architecture: x86_64 CPUs: 4 Total Memory: 7.683 GiB Name: husamuddin-Aspire-E1-572G ID: RLPM:FCJP:LJQV:5OZZ:P7QS:NA4M:QET7:LTMX:NWTZ:EUOI:NLOR:FZPK Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker Debug Mode (client): false Debug Mode (server): false Username: husamuddin Registry: https://index.docker.io/v1/ WARNING: No swap limit support Insecure Registries:  127.0.0.0/8
2 [2017-01-04T16:03:27] <Husamuddin> any ideas!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T16:14:42] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgdid you originally start the container from root, and are now trying to stop it as a regular user?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T17:00:21] <dragon788> siassaj: you simply combine your two commands into one "call" and this would create a single layer with all the changes from both, IIRC you can also while building a container run a couple commands from the command line and then "commit" afterwards in order to control when the layer actually gets saved
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T17:48:25] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T17:48:53] <galvesribeiro> does anyone ever used Docker.DotNet to talk to docker daemon? I have a question regarding label filtering and appreciate any help on that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T18:32:02] <mmisztal1980> matrixbot: I've managed to resolve the network issues we've been investigating 2 days ago. the boot2docker vm now has NW connectivity and is getting an ip v4 address, however the docker service is listening on:::2376and is thus unreachable from the outside ... what the heck?
2 [2017-01-04T18:33:17] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgthat's an ipv6 socket
3 [2017-01-04T18:33:33] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgwould need to get it so that it listens on ipv4
4 [2017-01-04T18:36:13] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgactually, that may not even be an issue, as it should be implicit
5 [2017-01-04T18:37:21] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgassumingtelnetis installed on the VM, can you connect usingtelnet localhost 2376?
6 [2017-01-04T18:40:17] <mmisztal1980> let me check that
7 [2017-01-04T18:40:41] <mmisztal1980> let me check that
8 [2017-01-04T18:41:43] <mmisztal1980> connection was successful
9 [2017-01-04T18:46:07] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgbut no joy connecting to that socket from outside the VM?
10 [2017-01-04T18:48:28] <mmisztal1980> yep
11 [2017-01-04T18:48:44] <mmisztal1980> curiously I can ping it though
12 [2017-01-04T18:48:51] <mmisztal1980> PS D:\\Checkout\\PoC.Docker> test-netconnection 192.168.8.101 -port 2376WARNING: TCP connect to 192.168.8.101:2376 failedComputerName           : 192.168.8.101RemoteAddress          : 192.168.8.101RemotePort             : 2376InterfaceAlias         : vEthernet (DockerExternal)SourceAddress          : 192.168.8.101PingSucceeded          : TruePingReplyDetails (RTT) : 0 msTcpTestSucceeded       : False

14 [2017-01-04T18:49:17] <mmisztal1980> boot2docker doesn't have a firewall - does it?
15 [2017-01-04T18:49:39] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgit shouldn't, that would aggravate a lot of folks out of the gate :)
16 [2017-01-04T18:49:43] <mmisztal1980> boot2docker doesn't have a firewall - does it?
17 [2017-01-04T18:50:08] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgbut is there a Windows firewall at play, here?
18 [2017-01-04T18:50:09] <dragon788> it shouldn't have a firewall, but you are essentially going through 2 layers of networking
19 [2017-01-04T18:51:36] <dragon788> ovidiub13: typically I\'ve seen places maintain two images, one for building and one for running, they could both inherit from the same base image and your build script could build the "build" and then use that to create the "run"
20 [2017-01-04T18:52:27] <mmisztal1980> I don't believe so, but I'll double check
21 [2017-01-04T18:53:07] <madpipeline> dragon788: that is the plan, but I'm not sure if we can do the inheritance thing, sice the devel image will be very much different
22 [2017-01-04T18:53:11] <mmisztal1980> no change after disabling the windows firewall
23 [2017-01-04T18:54:02] <dragon788> oh yeah, you would have  base => devel and base => runtime, you wouldn't want to go base => devel => runtime, that would bloat the image too much
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T18:43:37] <madpipeline> hello world
2 [2017-01-04T18:44:59] <madpipeline> I know I'm doing something stupid, but I don't know how else to do it. I need advice.
3 [2017-01-04T18:45:03] <madpipeline> I'm working on making a docker image for production for Pootle here: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-01-04T18:45:18] <madpipeline> And I'm not sure what to do about the development packages, that are needed to build the image, but not needed to run the service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T18:45:18] <matjazmav> Hey anyone using microsoft/mssql-server-Linux image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T18:59:36] <madpipeline> And how would I make that base image?
2 [2017-01-04T19:00:05] <madpipeline> the problem I'm having is with the devel packages that I need to install, and then remove in the runtime image
3 [2017-01-04T19:00:22] <madpipeline> but those packages come with some dependencies
4 [2017-01-04T19:00:31] <dragon788> are you building a Windows NanoServer image or something on an ubuntu/CentOS base?
5 [2017-01-04T19:00:34] <madpipeline> and I'm not sure on what's the best way to keep track of those
6 [2017-01-04T19:01:01] <madpipeline> I'm basing off the python image.. so eventualy it's debian
7 [2017-01-04T19:25:21] <madpipeline> I need gcc to compile some python modules
8 [2017-01-04T19:25:43] <madpipeline> and I don't need gcc in the runtime image
9 [2017-01-04T19:25:46] <madpipeline> for example
10 [2017-01-04T19:25:50] <madpipeline> gcc is not the only one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T19:06:58] <dragon788> so the runtime image uses a package that you are compiling in the devel image or it requires an environment similar to the devel image minus a few devel packages?
2 [2017-01-04T23:24:24] <dragon788> the container ID is a random GUID, you can pass the--name somenameto adocker runcommand to give it a name you can reference, but it needs to be unique
3 [2017-01-04T23:24:41] <dragon788> galvesribeiro: ^^
4 [2017-01-04T23:25:57] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgah
5 [2017-01-04T23:26:18] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orghostname is the same as the container id
6 [2017-01-04T23:26:32] <galvesribeiro> unless you specify the --name
7 [2017-01-04T23:26:33] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgwhy would you need to change that?
8 [2017-01-04T23:26:38] <dragon788> the hostname from outside of the container or inside?
9 [2017-01-04T23:26:40] <galvesribeiro> I don't need to change
10 [2017-01-04T23:29:45] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgGutemberg Ribeiro (Gitter): sorry, must have misunderstood where you were going with that.
11 [2017-01-04T23:30:33] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgDaniel Ram (Gitter): seems normal to me. What do you see when you rundocker cp --help?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T20:50:33] <galvesribeiro> guys, the container id by default is always be set as hostname, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T21:22:52] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgfrom what I'm seeing, the container id is always a uniquely generated hexadecimal number
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T23:25:16] <galvesribeiro> hey
2 [2017-01-04T23:25:20] <galvesribeiro> hum...
3 [2017-01-04T23:25:29] <galvesribeiro> the point is not the container name actually
4 [2017-01-04T23:25:40] <galvesribeiro> I'm trying to get the hostname itself
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-04T23:26:44] <danieldram> when I use docker cp it copies to local machine not my aws  EC2 is this normal?
2 [2017-01-04T23:34:50] <danieldram> somebody messed up my docker-compose file and now I need to copy the db exports from the container to the host to preserve them :(
3 [2017-01-04T23:35:45] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgcan you login to the instance and rundocker cpthere?
4 [2017-01-04T23:36:04] <danieldram> hmm good idea!
5 [2017-01-04T23:36:05] <galvesribeiro> matrixbot: no problem
6 [2017-01-04T23:38:34] <danieldram> hmm once I ssh into the docker-machine it won't have reference to the docker containers?
7 [2017-01-04T23:39:11] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgcan't say I've tried it
8 [2017-01-04T23:39:15] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgso, try it :)
9 [2017-01-04T23:39:25] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgyou might need to become root
10 [2017-01-04T23:41:56] <danieldram> I can ssh into the docker-machine but when I set the env it doesn't exist
11 [2017-01-04T23:43:04] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orggetting in over my head on this one
12 [2017-01-04T23:43:24] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgat a fundamental level, why are you not fond of copying to your local filesystem?
13 [2017-01-04T23:43:38] <danieldram> files are large.
14 [2017-01-04T23:43:57] <danieldram> I would have to upload them to the EC2 afterwards and mongo upsert them
15 [2017-01-04T23:44:05] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgthought that might be the reason
16 [2017-01-04T23:44:19] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orglet me ponder this a sec
17 [2017-01-04T23:44:32] <danieldram> when I do docker exec -it on the contianer, I can see the files
18 [2017-01-04T23:44:42] <danieldram> but I can't move them from there
19 [2017-01-04T23:45:02] <danieldram> when I do docker-machine ssh EC2, I can't locate the container to pull the files
20 [2017-01-04T23:48:49] <danieldram> Like there should be a way to move the files from a container on the computer that hosts the container right?
21 [2017-01-05T00:06:09] <danieldram> I guess there's no way arund it
22 [2017-01-05T00:06:35] <danieldram> I'll just cp the big ass files and reupload them to the same instance, so odd we can't do this.
23 [2017-01-05T05:16:51] <danieldram> matrixbot: yea I can get the files there, but if I try to mv them to a root folder, it won't do it.
24 [2017-01-05T05:17:05] <danieldram> matrixbot: even as super user
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T00:11:49] <matrixbot> @quaddo:matrix.orgwait, you said you can rundocker exec -iton the container, and you can indeed see the files you want?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T02:30:39] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
2 [2017-01-05T02:31:06] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-01-05T02:31:33] <galvesribeiro> that happen when I'm trying to set a label in a running container... it is not possible? :(
4 [2017-01-05T02:35:51] <galvesribeiro>  [<-ISSUE->]
5 [2017-01-05T02:36:08] <galvesribeiro> that was merged, so I wonder if it reached the beta channels
6 [2017-01-05T03:42:32] <galvesribeiro> ok, passed that...
7 [2017-01-05T03:46:25] <galvesribeiro> so... is there a way to make a label or a env to have its value generated (i.e. a random number) while the container is starting?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T11:30:42] <ioan-cristea> Hi. I want to know if I can run multiple websites on a server, served by multiple containers.
2 [2017-01-05T11:32:41] <ioan-cristea> I understand, I will try. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T11:31:47] <Bajix> KRIOFT: Yes; use something like ELB to do the port mappings then run containers on separate ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T13:43:15] <galvesribeiro> hey guys, how can my container access the host machine? I mean, which of the IPs the containers should hit to get to the host?
2 [2017-01-05T14:30:07] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: it doesn't work :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T14:05:10] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: Use the hostname of your machine. That's the easiest way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T14:31:49] <am0nshi> galvesribeiro: for what purposes you nedd host machine?
2 [2017-01-05T14:32:27] <galvesribeiro> the container need to query the Docker Remote API of the host to check some stuff
3 [2017-01-05T14:32:54] <am0nshi> galvesribeiro: you can mount host docker.sock into your machine
4 [2017-01-05T14:33:03] <am0nshi> and write http requests into it
5 [2017-01-05T14:33:10] <galvesribeiro> there is no docker.sock in windows :(
6 [2017-01-05T14:46:34] <am0nshi> use unix 8)
7 [2017-01-05T14:57:02] <galvesribeiro> I cant hehehe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T15:14:31] <damilare> Question, anyone has a strategy to make Docker Builds faster, I don’t have to re-install my libraries and dependencies all the time I make tiny changes to my source code
2 [2017-01-05T15:15:03] <am0nshi> damilare: MOUNT?
3 [2017-01-05T15:15:37] <am0nshi> and then will be no need to use builds at all, build is environment only for dev
4 [2017-01-05T15:23:37] <damilare> MOUNT?
5 [2017-01-05T15:23:58] <damilare> how do you mean, and dev env is actaullly my main concerned
6 [2017-01-05T15:24:44] <am0nshi> damilare: $ docker run -d -P \\--volume-driver=flocker \\-v my-named-volume:/webapp \\ <- this line--name web training/webapp python app.py
7 [2017-01-05T15:24:50] <am0nshi>  [<-LINK->]
8 [2017-01-05T15:26:01] <damilare> hmmm
9 [2017-01-05T15:26:02] <damilare> thanks
10 [2017-01-05T15:27:45] <damilare> this way, I dont have to build images when I make changes to my source code then
11 [2017-01-05T15:27:48] <damilare> makes sense thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T15:27:31] <galvesribeiro> there must be a way to a container to talk to a docker host :(
2 [2017-01-05T15:28:26] <am0nshi> galvesribeiro:  [<-LINK->] and dont use windows ^^
3 [2017-01-05T15:28:35] <am0nshi> damilare: +
4 [2017-01-05T15:28:53] <galvesribeiro> am0nshi: that is what I'm using
5 [2017-01-05T15:29:08] <galvesribeiro> don't use windows is not an option
6 [2017-01-05T15:29:58] <am0nshi> galvesribeiro: its called lxc containers (linux containers), in windows you loose all features they provide :) and u make from docker vagrant :)
7 [2017-01-05T15:30:21] <galvesribeiro> not anymore
8 [2017-01-05T15:30:31] <galvesribeiro> its is not lxc cotnainers-only anymore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T16:29:24] <SISheogorath> @damilare Check some onbuild images. Like https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/7.4/onbuild/DockerfileThey are made to preinstall dependencies.
2 [2017-01-05T16:32:50] <damilare> thanks@SISheogorath
3 [2017-01-05T16:34:19] <SISheogorath> but it's not recommended to use the onbuildimages for production
4 [2017-01-05T17:31:52] <SISheogorath> chaitanyapochampally: I know there are people using Jenkins with plugins. They are mostly hanging around in #ci-cd inside the Slack community. So may consider to join community.docker.com
5 [2017-01-05T18:40:52] <chaitanyapochampally> SISheogorath: thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T17:04:52] <chaitanyapochampally> all: has anyone tried using docker build and publish plugin in Jenknis? Is that working fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T02:50:37] <galvesribeiro> now docker is trying to piss me off
2 [2017-01-06T02:50:39] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-01-06T02:50:51] <galvesribeiro> this throw when calling anydocker run
4 [2017-01-06T03:05:49] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T06:17:09] <nischay30> can anybody tell me what is the difference between docker stack deploy and docker deploy?
2 [2017-01-06T10:59:11] <nischay30> Define Your Volume likevolumes:$Home/data:/dataand in environment Variables:ENIVRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME: '/data'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T08:52:59] <milanvdmria> I assume the docker host has a volume to which I have to write the outcomes of a python script inside a docker container. This host volume has to be mounted on the docker container which runs the python script. But how can I get this path of this mounted host volume and put it as a ENV in the docker container? (so that the python script knows where to write its data to)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:24:16] <iDVB> Anyone know of a good example code/repo for Docker(dev+prod)+Node App(requiring build) ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:25:26] <killerspaz> Unfortunately I had not seen a complete/good sample, and I'm not capable of open-sourcing mine atm, but if you need help feel free to ask... I will say this, check outdocker-composethe second you understand how to make a Dockerfile, and deep dive into networking and volumes, and you should get up to speed pretty quick
2 [2017-01-06T16:26:17] <killerspaz> at least nothing that suited my needs and/or standards.... I took a TDD approach for development locally, and integration tests for containerized development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:28:34] <iDVB> Thanks@killerspazI have a working compose and docker files for my stack.(Node+ReactJS+HotReload+Postgres+Nginx) but its local dev only. Just really struggling to make the leap to TINY docker images, ready for prod.  Would you even be able to share your compose/dockerfile? usually not too much propriety in there, no?
2 [2017-01-06T16:29:47] <iDVB> The next big question is what to go with for private/hosted CI/CD and cloud host (noOps). So far, the best looks like Codeship+Cloud66
3 [2017-01-06T16:31:12] <iDVB> Our infra is small, we def want AWS cloud (political reasons) but don't really want to manage the infra for security updates, patches, for OS and docker, hence Cloud66.
4 [2017-01-06T16:32:46] <killerspaz> iDVB: for small images, check outalpine linux... super small base image of like 50mb
5 [2017-01-06T16:33:16] <killerspaz> as for repos, we private host internal to our network as our deployments are by the thousands internally deployed to individual machines
6 [2017-01-06T16:34:33] <iDVB> but what are people using for dev vs prod workflows?   Eg. compose for prod seems non-existant. Codeship ignores compose and uses  its own services/steps.yml ..... same for Cloud66 which uses services/manifest.yml
7 [2017-01-06T16:34:34] <killerspaz> but depending on your existing SAAS options (i.e., if you use github or bitbucket, etc etc) there are various approaches like pipelines, or even jenkins if you're so inclined
8 [2017-01-06T16:34:46] <killerspaz> yeah that's typical
9 [2017-01-06T16:35:30] <iDVB> I've spend a few days google around to see what people are using for the full workflow. We'd ideally like to use docker in DEV and Prod
10 [2017-01-06T16:36:49] <iDVB> I've also heard quite a few opinions that docker+DBs are not ready for prod .... hence Cloud66 is using native boxes and not containers for DB and loadbalancer. For me... that looks like a very fragmented workflow.
11 [2017-01-06T16:38:15] <iDVB> killerspaz: Yup, completely understand your last..... but who actually uses that IN prod? what do the commands before and afterdocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.ymllook like?
12 [2017-01-06T16:39:04] <iDVB> maybe the answer is so simple I'm missing it?
13 [2017-01-06T16:40:14] <iDVB> how do I get the output of that command into a production enviroment.... and if my DEV compose uses a container for DB.... then what  should PROD use. (considering alot of people seem to think docker+db+prod === bad)
14 [2017-01-06T16:40:49] <killerspaz> iDVB: i PM'd you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:36:17] <killerspaz> so you havedocker-compose.yml, which should be the bare minimum to get an image to at least build... thendocker-compose.override.ymlthat docker-compose will automatically read, so adocker-compose upwill merge those two files natively.... in this file you can expose ports to your host for testing, set ENV vars liekNODE_ENV=developmentthen you'll typically have a separate compose file for prod, which I namedocker-compose.prod.yml, and execute asdocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:42:32] <andersonkyle> Is there anyway to force docker to store credentials in plaintext in the config file?  It is keeps using wincred and I don't want to use that...
2 [2017-01-06T16:43:10] <andersonkyle> I've logged out and logged back in to no avail.
3 [2017-01-06T16:43:42] <andersonkyle> I definitely remember my local machine storing them in the config file, but for some reason it now is only using wincred.   Any ideas?
4 [2017-01-06T16:45:40] <killerspaz> creds for a registry?
5 [2017-01-06T16:45:56] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-01-06T16:48:25] <andersonkyle> Yes
7 [2017-01-06T16:49:35] <andersonkyle> How can I force docker to use the config file to store the credentials instead of wincred on Windows?
8 [2017-01-06T16:53:36] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: I guess you didn't read it cause it doesn't explain how to set the config to use plain text.
9 [2017-01-06T16:53:42] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: It only gives a single example of setting it to Mac OSX's credential manager.
10 [2017-01-06T16:54:32] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: If you see it there, what exactly is the setting for plain text?
11 [2017-01-06T16:55:18] <killerspaz> dude, if you can't read, that's on you... there's literally 3 bullet points in that section indicating your options
12 [2017-01-06T16:55:35] <killerspaz> This is the list of currently available credentials helpers and where you can download them from:
13 [2017-01-06T16:55:52] <andersonkyle> D-BUS, MacOS, Windows...
14 [2017-01-06T16:56:22] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: Again, if it were there, you'd answer the question.  It aint', so you can't.
15 [2017-01-06T16:57:16] <killerspaz> dude, you either choose one of the 3, or use a config, just like it says on the page
16 [2017-01-06T16:57:26] <killerspaz> the end, done.... there's no more conversation happening between us at this point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:51:19] <sc6l6d3v> Hi, am trying to debug a container that blows up starting my app and am down to looking at linux startup files that process various config files. Why would I be getting a permission denied when trying to copy the entire image from the root as follows:montreux:mlt-viz hkatz$ docker cp   d340eba864a1:/ ~/tmp/dockroot\nmkdir /Users/hkatz/tmp/dockroot/consul-template/config.d: permission denied?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:51:47] <killerspaz> it says on that page how to define the credStore, please read the page I sent.
2 [2017-01-06T16:52:15] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: No it doesn't.
3 [2017-01-06T16:52:52] <killerspaz> so you don\'t see the 42pt font text that says "Credentials store" ???
4 [2017-01-06T16:53:03] <killerspaz> and the subheader entitled "Usage" ?
5 [2017-01-06T16:56:02] <killerspaz> READ THE WHOLE PAGE, I'm done talking to people that don't RTFM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:58:01] <SISheogorath> iDVB: may check hackmd, we build an awesome docker container there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T16:58:52] <andersonkyle> Again, the question is docker is defaulting to wincred every time I perform docker login.  How, where and what setting is required to force it to save the credentials in plain text in the config file?  That is not explained on this page.  I've read it many times.
2 [2017-01-06T16:59:25] <killerspaz> You should find a new job
3 [2017-01-06T17:00:10] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: You obviously don't know the answer so why bother helping?
4 [2017-01-06T17:01:07] <andersonkyle> killerspaz: Is it really that hard to explicitly provide the information I'm requesting?  If you knew the answer you would I'm sure.  But it's clear you do not...
5 [2017-01-06T17:02:45] <killerspaz> i wish i could block you
6 [2017-01-06T17:02:48] <killerspaz> you're really dense
7 [2017-01-06T17:02:54] <killerspaz> right on the fucking page it says: [<-CODE->]
8 [2017-01-06T17:03:15] <killerspaz> so put your credentials in there like the format it shows at the bottom of the page
9 [2017-01-06T17:03:21] <killerspaz> if you read the page fully, you wouldn't continue to ask
10 [2017-01-06T17:03:39] <killerspaz> don't put your ignorance on me pal
11 [2017-01-06T17:04:27] <andersonkyle> Again.  docker login is not storing them in config.json.  That's what I'm trying to fix.  I need the docker login command to store them in plain text in config.json....
12 [2017-01-06T17:04:59] <andersonkyle> Its using wincred for some reason and I'm trying to find out how I can disable that.
13 [2017-01-06T17:22:47] <aios> killerspaz: be simple and smart.
14 [2017-01-06T17:23:37] <aios> kanderson450: what kind of that problem - you can't login another PR instead hub.docker?
15 [2017-01-06T17:25:13] <andersonkyle> aios: I'm able to login to a private registry using :docker login private.registry.comBut the credentials aren't being saved in%USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.jsonInstead it is using an external credential store, in my case: wincred.
16 [2017-01-06T17:26:02] <aios> kanderson450: so you are logged in private registry?
17 [2017-01-06T17:26:06] <andersonkyle> aios: I'm trying to force docker to save the credentials in%USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.jsoninstead of the external credential store but I can't seem to find any information on how to do that.
18 [2017-01-06T17:26:38] <andersonkyle> aios: Yes.  Logging in and Logging out results in the same behavior.wincredis the credential store docker keeps using.
19 [2017-01-06T17:28:06] <aios> kanderson450:  [<-LINK->]
20 [2017-01-06T17:28:37] <aios> look at here - you can try use [<-LINK->] - and look all you stored credentials
21 [2017-01-06T17:29:28] <andersonkyle> aios: Those are the external credential store options.  I don't want to use an external store, but instead want to save everything in plain-text withinconfig.json
22 [2017-01-06T17:30:11] <andersonkyle> And I know that my docker installation used to behave this way, but recently began usingwincredthe Windows Credential Manager external store.
23 [2017-01-06T17:30:35] <SISheogorath> that's the point. As docker only calls the credential manager. Store it plain into config.json is not avaiable
24 [2017-01-06T17:30:38] <andersonkyle> I'm trying to figure out how to disable that.
25 [2017-01-06T17:31:12] <SISheogorath> you can read it from config.json but not write right now
26 [2017-01-06T17:33:04] <andersonkyle> The config.json only saves the URL, and credstore: wincred   No matter if I remove that it keeps coming back
27 [2017-01-06T17:33:48] <andersonkyle> When it is working properly, config.json should save the URL, auth token and email address.
28 [2017-01-06T17:34:30] <andersonkyle> I can't seem to find any way of forcingdocker loginto use config.json instead of the external credential store.
29 [2017-01-06T17:37:11] <SISheogorath> O.o it works as designed: [<-LINK->]
30 [2017-01-06T17:38:14] <SISheogorath> And as mentioned store it to the config.json is not an option right now
31 [2017-01-06T17:38:27] <SISheogorath> so no, it's not possible.
32 [2017-01-06T17:38:42] <SISheogorath> If you disagree with that open an issue
33 [2017-01-06T17:39:18] <andersonkyle> SISheogorath: Ok, so what you're saying is that they've disabled the plain-text option completely?
34 [2017-01-06T17:41:37] <SISheogorath> you can't save your credentials to config.json, right. You can read them from there (as far as I know. Didn't test it) but you can not write it there for sure by using the docker login command
35 [2017-01-06T17:43:12] <andersonkyle> SISheogorath: Ok.  That's disappointing, but thanks for the help!
36 [2017-01-06T17:45:37] <SISheogorath> it's a bad habit to write credentials unencrypted to a file. So it's more or less secret managment. As mentioned if you disagree with that file an issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T18:02:15] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
2 [2017-01-06T18:02:19] <galvesribeiro> quick question...
3 [2017-01-06T18:02:40] <galvesribeiro> is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not?
4 [2017-01-06T18:03:59] <galvesribeiro> I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible?
5 [2017-01-06T18:06:34] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: hey! :)
6 [2017-01-06T18:06:50] <galvesribeiro> that is the poin
7 [2017-01-06T18:06:52] <galvesribeiro> point
8 [2017-01-06T18:07:47] <galvesribeiro> in Orleans we have a health monitoring service which all nodes of the cluster ping each other and after a given number of ping fail from some servers, they declare it dead, and remove from the cluster membership ring
9 [2017-01-06T18:08:08] <galvesribeiro> it already works pretty fine on VMs and bare metal
10 [2017-01-06T18:08:24] <galvesribeiro> I did implemented an Docker membership provider
11 [2017-01-06T18:08:57] <galvesribeiro> the problem now is that for the provider, it only knows if a node is up or down only by checking docker daemon if it is up or down
12 [2017-01-06T18:08:59] <galvesribeiro> and that is our problem
13 [2017-01-06T18:09:18] <galvesribeiro> a container can be app, but some internal thread in the application process for whatever reason is blocked
14 [2017-01-06T18:09:31] <galvesribeiro> so no new requests should go to that node
15 [2017-01-06T18:09:45] <galvesribeiro> so the idea is to ask docker (or swarm) to kill that node
16 [2017-01-06T18:10:01] <galvesribeiro> but to be sure of that, I need to detect this stallness correctly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T18:05:55] <killerspaz> need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it.
2 [2017-01-06T18:06:33] <killerspaz> you could simplyexecaps | grep APPto see if it's running external from container on the host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T18:10:19] <killerspaz> how is the provider checking daemon status?
2 [2017-01-06T18:10:31] <killerspaz> remember, i know nothing about Orleans, so my apologies for simpleton questions related to that
3 [2017-01-06T18:11:54] <galvesribeiro> nah no worries :D
4 [2017-01-06T18:12:40] <galvesribeiro> that is another problem :D
5 [2017-01-06T18:12:55] <killerspaz> if you are simply doing adocker ps | grep MY_CONTAINER_NAME | grep Runningor something of the nature, it's simple to also do something like:docker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ps aux | grep processordocker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ping somehost.com
6 [2017-01-06T18:13:35] <galvesribeiro> in linux, you map docker.socket and you make docker API requests to it
7 [2017-01-06T18:13:51] <galvesribeiro> but on windows, there is no docker.socket!!! o.o
8 [2017-01-06T18:16:30] <killerspaz> imo it's best to keep that check external to the container... i like to couple things downstream instead of upstream... but that's preference
9 [2017-01-06T18:16:45] <galvesribeiro> we have this check external
10 [2017-01-06T18:17:10] <galvesribeiro> each node of Orleans cluster (which is a container) send health messages to each other
11 [2017-01-06T18:17:40] <galvesribeiro> the rendevour point of those messages, used to be the membership table
12 [2017-01-06T18:17:59] <galvesribeiro> if multiple nodes try to reach a node and fail (lets say 3 times), that node is marked as dead
13 [2017-01-06T18:18:03] <galvesribeiro> even if the machine is running
14 [2017-01-06T18:18:09] <galvesribeiro> so noone will send a message to it again
15 [2017-01-06T18:18:16] <galvesribeiro> now, in docker, we don't have that table
16 [2017-01-06T18:18:25] <galvesribeiro> we were relying on docker labels
17 [2017-01-06T18:19:09] <galvesribeiro> so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running
18 [2017-01-06T18:19:22] <galvesribeiro> that would make them know who is on the cluster
19 [2017-01-06T18:20:31] <galvesribeiro> if a container is killed/exit, next query on docker api will return all containers - that one
20 [2017-01-06T18:20:56] <galvesribeiro> that is ok for periodic refreshes and consider only the container up or down
21 [2017-01-06T18:21:01] <galvesribeiro> the problem is internal
22 [2017-01-06T18:21:15] <galvesribeiro> I need to mark a container as dead even if it is running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T18:21:18] <killerspaz> could you then iterate over all the containers and exec a "health check" script that is consistently implemented?
2 [2017-01-06T18:21:32] <killerspaz> even if it does NOTHING?
3 [2017-01-06T18:22:00] <galvesribeiro> the problem is not the healthcheck mecanism
4 [2017-01-06T18:22:03] <galvesribeiro> we already have it
5 [2017-01-06T18:22:09] <galvesribeiro> the problem is how to mark it as dead
6 [2017-01-06T18:22:30] <killerspaz> errr, other than just killing the container?
7 [2017-01-06T18:22:40] <killerspaz> or can you modify a label?
8 [2017-01-06T18:22:50] <galvesribeiro> ok way, let me rephrase
9 [2017-01-06T18:22:53] <killerspaz> i haven't messed with labels really outside of RancherOs
10 [2017-01-06T18:23:12] <galvesribeiro> the problem is how to save the counted votes to kill that node
11 [2017-01-06T18:23:17] <killerspaz> so my knowledge there is low as well, other than you can kinda query against them
12 [2017-01-06T18:23:31] <galvesribeiro> remember, before docker, we had that table as a central point
13 [2017-01-06T18:23:35] <galvesribeiro> now I have labels
14 [2017-01-06T18:23:38] <galvesribeiro> so the ideal would be
15 [2017-01-06T18:23:41] <killerspaz> ahhh.... yeah, can you store that in a label at all? otherwise you'll probably have to persist that yourself somewhere
16 [2017-01-06T18:23:51] <galvesribeiro> I can
17 [2017-01-06T18:24:05] <galvesribeiro> labels are writeable in runtime?
18 [2017-01-06T18:24:15] <galvesribeiro> I mean, each vote will increment a counter in it
19 [2017-01-06T18:24:19] <galvesribeiro> does it work?
20 [2017-01-06T18:24:49] <killerspaz> damn [<-ISSUE->]
21 [2017-01-06T18:25:10] <killerspaz> well, could the container persist it internally?
22 [2017-01-06T18:25:21] <killerspaz> simply have a file with a count in it?
23 [2017-01-06T18:25:37] <killerspaz> lame, i know.... but it could suffice
24 [2017-01-06T18:27:02] <killerspaz> wait... now i'm confused: [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-01-06T18:27:38] <killerspaz> oh nvm... that's a container creation
26 [2017-01-06T18:28:10] <galvesribeiro> Yeah creation isnok
27 [2017-01-06T18:28:16] <galvesribeiro> The problem is update
28 [2017-01-06T18:28:21] <killerspaz> right....
29 [2017-01-06T18:28:27] <galvesribeiro> Shame... it is supposed to be metadata
30 [2017-01-06T18:28:33] <galvesribeiro> So it should be updatable
31 [2017-01-06T18:28:49] <galvesribeiro> Regarding the file with the count
32 [2017-01-06T18:28:56] <killerspaz> well without having a central db for that, i'd just shoot the count into a file inside the container, and make that an opinionated implementation
33 [2017-01-06T18:29:09] <killerspaz> although, it's not the prettiest
34 [2017-01-06T18:29:18] <galvesribeiro> The problem is that it will cause races
35 [2017-01-06T18:30:04] <galvesribeiro> Remember, there could be thousands of request to declare a node dead if you have thousands of containers in that cluster
36 [2017-01-06T18:30:14] <galvesribeiro> So it is very fragile
37 [2017-01-06T18:31:42] <galvesribeiro> In the regular membership table there is a lock mechanism to avoid the races
38 [2017-01-06T18:33:21] <galvesribeiro> If the exec where guaranteed to be exclusive execution, then maybe it would work... but I doubt
39 [2017-01-06T19:32:51] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: I think I found a solution
40 [2017-01-06T19:32:58] <galvesribeiro> not beautiful but maybe work
41 [2017-01-06T19:33:07] <galvesribeiro> let me format here and paste to you, 1m
42 [2017-01-06T19:39:05] <killerspaz> nice
43 [2017-01-06T19:51:04] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
44 [2017-01-06T19:51:44] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: suggestions are welcome :)
45 [2017-01-06T19:59:07] <killerspaz> yep, basically what I was thinking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T20:00:24] <galvesribeiro> I'm afraid of having multiple people trying to kill the same silo heheheh
2 [2017-01-06T20:00:31] <galvesribeiro> because there is no lock whatsoever
3 [2017-01-06T20:00:32] <galvesribeiro> :P
4 [2017-01-06T20:04:10] <killerspaz> at some point the race should work itself out, shouldn't it?
5 [2017-01-06T20:10:40] <galvesribeiro> Only after the silo is dead heheh
6 [2017-01-06T20:11:40] <galvesribeiro> We could avoid the files if we could increment a counter on labels
7 [2017-01-06T20:11:52] <galvesribeiro> But that isnt possible unfortunately
8 [2017-01-06T20:14:39] <galvesribeiro> Ok assuming this problem is "sorted", nothing from this would work if I can\'t make the container to reach the docker API on the host (i.e from inside the container make requests to http|tcp://hostIP:2375)
9 [2017-01-06T20:18:03] <galvesribeiro> On linux hosts just need to map the docker.socket file and make requests to it... easy... the only way I see is to make it work on windows hosts, is making this request thru network. However, I madetelnet hostIPonDockerNetwork 2375from inside a container and it dont connect from inside the container... the container can ping the host, just dont connect to the port
10 [2017-01-06T21:23:09] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: @galvesribeirooh that's badass
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:07:39] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: what version of Docker are you running?
2 [2017-01-06T21:08:19] <SISheogorath> If case of 1.12.x you can use the HEALTHCHECK option of the Dockerfile which provides healthchecks inside the container
3 [2017-01-06T21:09:25] <galvesribeiro> hummm
4 [2017-01-06T21:09:30] <galvesribeiro> let me check the version
5 [2017-01-06T21:09:48] <galvesribeiro> Docker version 1.13.0-rc4, build 88862e7
6 [2017-01-06T21:10:04] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: What kind of checks this HEALTHCHECK does?
7 [2017-01-06T21:10:48] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: it runs a followed command every 30 seconds if you don't specifiy another period and restarts the container if it fails
8 [2017-01-06T21:11:29] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-01-06T21:12:31] <SISheogorath> We do a very basic healthcheck here: [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-01-06T21:14:17] <galvesribeiro> hummm
11 [2017-01-06T21:14:19] <galvesribeiro> interesting...
12 [2017-01-06T21:14:34] <galvesribeiro> but I still need the file stuff
13 [2017-01-06T21:15:41] <galvesribeiro> I mean, looks like it only abstract the need to check if the files are > threshold
14 [2017-01-06T21:22:12] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: the major problem with this healt check is that it check from docker host process to a local container
15 [2017-01-06T21:22:15] <galvesribeiro> that is fine
16 [2017-01-06T21:22:19] <galvesribeiro> it is one type of chec
17 [2017-01-06T21:22:22] <galvesribeiro> check
18 [2017-01-06T21:22:27] <galvesribeiro> the problem is remote check
19 [2017-01-06T21:23:35] <SISheogorath> Oh yes, It's not a monitoring. It only makes sure that the container itself is in a healty state.
20 [2017-01-06T21:23:37] <galvesribeiro> the problematic container may think "hey I\'m ok" while the host for whatever reason is having a transient network partition problem, so other containers in other docker hosts can\'t talk to it
21 [2017-01-06T21:23:44] <galvesribeiro> yup
22 [2017-01-06T21:24:34] <galvesribeiro> I need a way to external containers to say "hey docker, that container is unhealthy" and eventually ask docker to kill it
23 [2017-01-06T21:24:50] <galvesribeiro> regardless what docker or the container itself think
24 [2017-01-06T21:25:07] <galvesribeiro> this pattern is common in distributed computing actually...
25 [2017-01-06T21:25:19] <SISheogorath> K8s, Rancher, Swarm
26 [2017-01-06T21:25:31] <SISheogorath> Take what you need they all check for that
27 [2017-01-06T21:26:05] <galvesribeiro> you mean they check themselves, not the containers
28 [2017-01-06T21:27:41] <SISheogorath> K8s and Rancher has healthchecks for their "services" and swarm simply checks that all containers have a healthy state. And as long as every container has a healty state all containers work as expected and everything from outside is L4 mesh magic :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:27:46] <killerspaz> i think he's saying they check the container's health status based on the result of that HEALTHCHECK entry as likely listed bydocker inspect, and have an option to auto-kill the container should it be unhealthy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:33:01] <galvesribeiro> There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it
2 [2017-01-06T21:33:46] <galvesribeiro> In orleans case the consensus is what I'm having problems to implement in docker due to those limitations
3 [2017-01-06T21:34:20] <galvesribeiro> The self check can be made with the HEALTHCHECK just fine I guess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:37:18] <iDVB> Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarms, Docker Cloud..... docker-compose.yml, docker-cloud.yml, services.yml(Cloud66), build.yml(Cloud66), codeship-services.yml(Codeship), codeship-steps.yml(Codeship)    does anyone else's brain hurt.... or just me?
2 [2017-01-06T21:38:01] <iDVB> I've pretty well got dev docker workflow working. I'm starting to loose hope for that to translate into a prod docker stack
3 [2017-01-06T21:39:19] <iDVB> docker-compose.ymlseems like a great implementation/standard file.... why did we feel the need to createdocker-cloud.yml?
4 [2017-01-06T21:39:20] <galvesribeiro> iDVB: this is called "Docker ecosystem around Docker"
5 [2017-01-06T21:39:36] <galvesribeiro> Anyway
6 [2017-01-06T21:40:37] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: @SISheogorathbut nothing of those health check strategies will work if I'm unable to reach docker daemon api from inside the container
7 [2017-01-06T21:41:08] <killerspaz> kill your main process to kill the container?
8 [2017-01-06T21:41:22] <killerspaz> otherwise, you need an orchestration system like kubernetes or rancher
9 [2017-01-06T21:42:23] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: Why should you need to reach the docker api from inside the container? As mentioned for unreachable nodes you have orchestration solutions like K8s, Rancher or swarm. They take care about that
10 [2017-01-06T21:42:33] <iDVB> galvesribeiro: Sorry, just burning out trying to ramp up to all things Docker/Containerizing. Still have a ton to learn about related best practises etc. Not wanting to deal with the Ops side of things. Docker Cloud seems to promise as much.... but requires another filedocker-cloud.ymlcreated, so I'm curious why. docker-compose seems to contain much of the same.
11 [2017-01-06T21:43:04] <iDVB> The same can be said about many other docker hosts or CI tools. Eg. my examples of codeship and cloud66
12 [2017-01-06T21:43:52] <SISheogorath> iDVB: it\'s really annoying yes :D but everyone have their own "best way to do it" so mhm have to deal with it
13 [2017-01-06T22:00:15] <killerspaz> iDVB: overrideis ALWAYS read along side ofdocker-compose.yml, unless-fis explicitly used
14 [2017-01-06T22:00:59] <killerspaz> so it's more suggested to put DEV changes in there, and create a separate compose for prod that can override your base, and execute as:docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
15 [2017-01-06T22:01:16] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:47:43] <galvesribeiro> @killerspazkill your main process to kill the container?That is doable for the local check@SISheogorathThe app running in the container have to read some labels from docker API to know which containers are part of the cluster and then inspect each one to get their IPs to connect to.We don't want to enforce users to use an external orchestration solution because none of them, will get what we need. In fact, we are using Swarm... When I say query Docker API, I mean query it thru Swarm endpoint
2 [2017-01-06T21:52:55] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: sorry my noobish, what is the difference? I though there is only 1 swarm o.O
3 [2017-01-06T21:53:16] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: how did you init swarm?docker swarm init?
4 [2017-01-06T21:53:29] <iDVB> SISheogorath:  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-06T21:55:39] <SISheogorath> wow this looks wrong :D you should do this in a Dockerfile or at least in a entrypoint script if you need to do it on startup
6 [2017-01-06T21:55:47] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: I didn't initialized swarm yet... I though it uses the (almost) same APIs as in docker daemon with just a diff endpoint... I'm testing now locally with only the daemon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T21:47:53] <iDVB> SISheogorath: thanks. I'm starting to see that now. I guess I'm a perfectionist and struggling with needing to guess at the best foot forward.  Wish someone would feel opinionated enough to just point to a workflow that seems to work well for them.  Docker Cloud looks decent but it is prod ready? Cloud66 looks like ikea for docker (in a good easy way) but I'mn struggling with their build process.
2 [2017-01-06T21:48:26] <galvesribeiro> btw, just receive a new docker update
3 [2017-01-06T21:48:27] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-01-06T21:50:43] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: wait. classic swarm or swarm-mode?
5 [2017-01-06T21:50:58] <iDVB> One of my issues is that I have a minimal prod container to run a nodejs app.  that its expecting to already be built and at the host location/buildhowever I need something to build those files using the same repo first. So do I need to create two containers, one for building and one for prod?  Whats the workflow for that? I guess I could include the built files in the repo.... but that seems dirty to me.
6 [2017-01-06T21:52:23] <SISheogorath> iDVB: what do you mean? Can you file an example repo?
7 [2017-01-06T21:52:35] <iDVB> absolutely.... sec
8 [2017-01-06T21:54:36] <iDVB> please disregard the fact that those examples don't have a CLEAN MINIMAL docker.... I do have one... here...
9 [2017-01-06T21:56:08] <iDVB> SISheogorath: ...sorry.. I just updated the gist
10 [2017-01-06T21:56:17] <iDVB> it now includes both dev and prod dockerfiles
11 [2017-01-06T21:57:05] <iDVB> so the issue is that the APP needs to npm install / yarn install all the deps including the devdeps. then it needs to build then those resulting files are the only thing that needs to go into the prod container
12 [2017-01-06T22:00:10] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: The only nodes who have access to the controler API of docker swarm mode are the managers. They are the only hosts who decide if the whole cluster lives or die. They ensure they can see each other and reschedule things in case a node goes doen. So the only nodes where you can run your service if it needs the docker API are the managers or you have to build some crazy "docker socket socat"-workarounds. :D Works and is fun but not really perfect ;)
13 [2017-01-06T22:01:18] <SISheogorath> So you never face that problem you descripted. In case a node is dead it's services are rescheduled somewhere else and everything is fine
14 [2017-01-06T22:02:44] <killerspaz> iDVB: and yeah as@SISheogorathmentioned i'd use a dockerfile to simplify your yml config
15 [2017-01-06T22:03:19] <iDVB> killerspaz: yup....sorry I think that gist might be older than that discovery. But the real issue is how to build my app and then put those files into the prod container
16 [2017-01-06T22:03:45] <killerspaz> that's what your Dockerfile would do
17 [2017-01-06T22:03:59] <iDVB> the prod one or the dev one?
18 [2017-01-06T22:04:05] <killerspaz> there would only be one
19 [2017-01-06T22:04:07] <iDVB> cuz the dev one does do it
20 [2017-01-06T22:04:23] <killerspaz> your ENV vars would imply to your app what mode it should be in
21 [2017-01-06T22:04:40] <iDVB> but I don't want dev source files or the deps to build them on/in the prod container
22 [2017-01-06T22:05:38] <galvesribeiro> So you never face that problem you descripted. In case a node is dead it's services are rescheduled somewhere else and everything is fineThis problem exist regardless of the containers or not. And it is not a matter of a Container is up or not, it is a matter of the application running inside of it is healthy or not
23 [2017-01-06T22:05:49] <killerspaz> so i assume you're going to need the deps no matter what in one form or another; assuming you're concat'ing them together somehow (js project i'm also assuming)
24 [2017-01-06T22:06:01] <iDVB> exactly
25 [2017-01-06T22:06:12] <iDVB> there are prod deps and dev deps
26 [2017-01-06T22:06:20] <killerspaz> right, so I have my output always go to adistfolder; regardless of mode
27 [2017-01-06T22:06:32] <killerspaz> that's what i copy to my docker container
28 [2017-01-06T22:06:55] <iDVB> also... the devdeps (node) require native apps in order to build..... none of that should be in prod
29 [2017-01-06T22:07:40] <killerspaz> mmmm i guess one could make that argument....
30 [2017-01-06T22:08:02] <killerspaz> personally I don't care about that, my images are no more than 60mb with gcc and such
31 [2017-01-06T22:08:03] <SISheogorath> iDVB: can you install them into the container, build it and than uninstall it?
32 [2017-01-06T22:08:13] <iDVB> well put it this way.... this.... should not need to be in prod....RUN apk add --no-cache make gcc g++ python
33 [2017-01-06T22:08:40] <killerspaz> i mostly agree... but also dont' care :P
34 [2017-01-06T22:08:46] <iDVB> and this....yarn installwill install and nativle compile with the above... a TON of useless stuff
35 [2017-01-06T22:08:55] <killerspaz> baremetal machines are likely to have those anyway
36 [2017-01-06T22:09:01] <killerspaz> so i dont' see it any different
37 [2017-01-06T22:09:27] <iDVB> as I understand.... this also slows down builds and adds to container size and layers significantly
38 [2017-01-06T22:09:31] <killerspaz> but keep in mind, that won't ever execute outside of the context of an image build
39 [2017-01-06T22:10:05] <killerspaz> well there's cached layers, so that becomes a moot point
40 [2017-01-06T22:10:13] <SISheogorath> iDVB: see [<-LINK->]
41 [2017-01-06T22:11:00] <SISheogorath> In this case we build an cpp application but as long as you keep install and uninstall in a singleRUNit doesn't effect the image size
42 [2017-01-06T22:11:01] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: that will affect your filesystem in your image, but not your image size... those layers will still exist in the image
43 [2017-01-06T22:12:13] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: It's the only layer which adds real content to the image >.>
44 [2017-01-06T22:13:19] <killerspaz> true; but i'm just saying overall i think your image is still the max bloat size in that context... you have to squash the layer (which can't be done via Dockerfile) and commit the image for it to rewrite the layer history... much like git and rebasing
45 [2017-01-06T22:13:46] <killerspaz> it can all be done, but not really worth the effort
46 [2017-01-06T22:13:53] <killerspaz> i mean disk space is so cheap these days
47 [2017-01-06T22:13:57] <iDVB> I have no experience, so I can\'t debate.... but everything I\'m reading is slapping hands for this kinda thing. Saying "MINIMAL CONTAINER", Immutable,  nothing in the container not needed. etc
48 [2017-01-06T22:14:13] <killerspaz> yeah i think there's some invisible lines you have to draw
49 [2017-01-06T22:14:34] <killerspaz> for example, i read that more as, don't put mongo and your node app in the same container
50 [2017-01-06T22:14:40] <iDVB> and I\'ve seen examples that show dockerfiles that "assume" the built app and just import it
51 [2017-01-06T22:14:43] <killerspaz> and not all containers CAN be immutable, simply due to data storage needs
52 [2017-01-06T22:15:11] <iDVB> are those supposed to use volumes then?
53 [2017-01-06T22:15:12] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: heh? actuall this whole block is one single layer.
54 [2017-01-06T22:16:08] <SISheogorath> there is nothing to squash
55 [2017-01-06T22:16:10] <killerspaz> iDVB: you could have your process build locally and then just copy everything over, that's feasible
56 [2017-01-06T22:16:28] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: the concept of "add then remove" is prime candidate for squashing
57 [2017-01-06T22:16:43] <killerspaz> but again, we're probably talking less than 20mb of layer data
58 [2017-01-06T22:18:08] <killerspaz> iDVB: but you'll still obviously need to do installs of say node, pm2, etc.... in which case you may still need gcc, etc
59 [2017-01-06T22:44:04] <killerspaz> man i really wish virtualbox would get their inotify game in check... this is some bullshit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:14:39] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: in all cases... how can I reach the Docker/Swarm API from inside the container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:47:57] <galvesribeiro> Btw, what is the diff between the two swarms?
2 [2017-01-06T22:51:19] <galvesribeiro> Classic swarm vs Swarm mode
3 [2017-01-06T22:51:27] <galvesribeiro> lol
4 [2017-01-06T22:51:36] <galvesribeiro> Shawarma is good
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:49:32] <killerspaz> k8s and docker swarm?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:49:34] <iDVB> Isnt that a show... "Between two swarms"?     .... sorry.... I had to... fried.
2 [2017-01-06T22:49:48] <iDVB> Anyway... thanks for the help everyone....need to do more reading
3 [2017-01-06T22:50:06] <killerspaz> I swarm, you swarm, we all swarm for shawarma
4 [2017-01-06T22:50:24] <killerspaz> lol also fried :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:53:09] <killerspaz> I think it's the mere fact it's integrated now? I am not really sure
2 [2017-01-06T22:55:18] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: mentioned that so I though there is any diff
3 [2017-01-06T22:56:45] <killerspaz> Yeah i think that's what he was referring to, before hand you used a swarm image to do the management for you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:56:36] <SISheogorath> Swarm is integrated now. (named swarm mode) But there is still the classic swarm tool kit
2 [2017-01-06T22:57:10] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] vs. [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-06T22:57:16] <galvesribeiro> @SISheogorathThe only nodes who have access to the controler API of docker swarm mode are the managersSo that means I cant have a docker cli connecting to it from outside it?
2 [2017-01-06T22:57:31] <galvesribeiro> The container will behave just as any docker client
3 [2017-01-06T22:57:48] <galvesribeiro> I just need them to have connectivity to the master nodes
4 [2017-01-06T22:57:50] <galvesribeiro> Thats all
5 [2017-01-06T22:58:20] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: you have to access thedocker.sockon the swarm managers in case you want to see/edit things.
6 [2017-01-06T22:58:45] <galvesribeiro> That is weird
7 [2017-01-06T22:58:58] <SISheogorath> That's named security :D
8 [2017-01-06T22:59:07] <galvesribeiro> Imagine that I have my cluster in azure or aws
9 [2017-01-06T22:59:29] <galvesribeiro> How can I connect to it ao I can issue docker run for instance?
10 [2017-01-06T23:00:32] <SISheogorath> why should you use docker run?
11 [2017-01-06T23:00:42] <galvesribeiro> Just an example
12 [2017-01-06T23:00:49] <galvesribeiro> To run a container in the swarm
13 [2017-01-06T23:00:57] <SISheogorath> yes
14 [2017-01-06T23:01:40] <galvesribeiro> You will use the tls cert and point to one of the master hosts IP address, correct?
15 [2017-01-06T23:02:50] <SISheogorath> what? I don't get your usecase x.x sry
16 [2017-01-06T23:04:40] <galvesribeiro> I'm trying to say that if you can connect to a docker swarm manager in order to issue commands a d manage it, why in earth cant a container connect to it using its IP as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T01:13:59] <SISheogorath> @galvesribeiro because first of all a container should not manage the docker swarm. With a few exceptions but in this case those containers easily can run on a manager node.On the other hand it is possible to expose the docker socket via tcp. BUT(!) that's very  danagrous and something you should never do. N E V E R.Some containers like traefik as reverse proxy use labels of docker containers to redirect traffic. in this case you use the already mentioned socat containers which expose the docker socket to special networks which are only used by the containers which need the docker socket to work
2 [2017-01-07T01:14:54] <galvesribeiro> ic
3 [2017-01-07T01:15:08] <galvesribeiro> the lack of security in docker socket trends to that
4 [2017-01-07T01:15:23] <galvesribeiro> I mean, there are tons of other ways to secure the managers or the APIs
5 [2017-01-07T01:15:32] <galvesribeiro> what I'm asking is introspection
6 [2017-01-07T01:15:34] <galvesribeiro> just it
7 [2017-01-07T01:15:43] <galvesribeiro> which should be available inside the containers
8 [2017-01-07T01:16:15] <galvesribeiro> just the way AWS provide a 169.x.x.x IP inside the container/VM so you can use as introspection endpoint from inside the container
9 [2017-01-07T01:16:21] <galvesribeiro> its a shame docker doesn't offer that
10 [2017-01-07T01:16:52] <galvesribeiro> and don\'t have it as an excuse of "security issues"... well, that is not a proper answer from them :D
11 [2017-01-07T01:17:11] <SISheogorath> the problem is that the docker socket controls a appliction running as root. you should avoid to expose something running as root. Exemption for this rule is only sshd
12 [2017-01-07T01:17:23] <galvesribeiro> yeah, I understand
13 [2017-01-07T01:17:40] <galvesribeiro> that is why it should be a TCP/HTTP endpoint exposed
14 [2017-01-07T01:17:49] <galvesribeiro> and not the .socket directly
15 [2017-01-07T01:18:21] <galvesribeiro> something like a service identity using a diff certificate that the containers can connect to and make whatever they are allowed to
16 [2017-01-07T01:18:40] <galvesribeiro> this case I'm showing is a totally legit usage of the APIs
17 [2017-01-07T01:18:57] <galvesribeiro> if there is a security problem with them, it should be addressed :D
18 [2017-01-07T01:19:27] <galvesribeiro> ask people to deploy extra infrastructure is something insane
19 [2017-01-07T01:19:39] <galvesribeiro> I mean, deploy an orchestration
20 [2017-01-07T01:19:58] <galvesribeiro> while docker already has everything most of people need in a very simple and generic way
21 [2017-01-07T01:20:23] <SISheogorath> O.o I still don't see the real usecase of your request. what do you need what you can't have right now?
22 [2017-01-07T01:20:32] <galvesribeiro> ok
23 [2017-01-07T01:21:41] <galvesribeiro> I need a container to go to docker (or swarm) and as "Hey, I need all containers that have a labeldeploymentId=12345" and it return a list of the containers info like Id, name, hostname, IP, Ports, etc
24 [2017-01-07T01:22:16] <galvesribeiro> docker remote APIs is suppose to be used like that
25 [2017-01-07T01:22:18] <SISheogorath> in this case you should address services not containers directly
26 [2017-01-07T01:22:39] <galvesribeiro> and it is secured by the TLS certificate
27 [2017-01-07T01:23:33] <galvesribeiro> ok so, "Docker, give me all containers from theService Awhich are running and have asomelabel=AAAAA"
28 [2017-01-07T01:23:52] <galvesribeiro> what I mean is, the remote API should be available
29 [2017-01-07T01:30:04] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure if you can label different containers of the same service in a different way
30 [2017-01-07T01:32:21] <galvesribeiro> ignore the label
31 [2017-01-07T01:32:44] <galvesribeiro> if the Service works as a filter and return me all the containers so I can inspect them, I'm ok with that :D
32 [2017-01-07T01:33:37] <SISheogorath> That sounds like Monitoring :D In this case run your software on a mananger node and everything is fine :D
33 [2017-01-07T01:34:05] <galvesribeiro> what if I make all my nodes managers?
34 [2017-01-07T01:35:58] <galvesribeiro> so you are saying that the only way to issue commands to a swarm is if I'm locally logged (ssh/powershell remote) on a manager node, right?
35 [2017-01-07T01:36:25] <galvesribeiro> so I can't remote manage a swarm cluster if I'm not logged into a manager node, right?
36 [2017-01-07T01:38:51] <SISheogorath> If you really want you can do it. But as mentioned it's not recommended.You can also use a container which is forced to run on manager nodes in your swarm like Portainer which allows you remote management but I guess you talk about CLI.So by using swarm-mode and stay as save as possible yes, you can only manage it while you ssh to it.
37 [2017-01-07T01:41:11] <galvesribeiro> CLI uses docker.socker (linux) or namedpipes (windows) to talk to the server when local logged... What I'm saying is to use Docker Remote API [<-LINK->] which uses the same TLS for client authenticate the requests
38 [2017-01-07T01:41:35] <galvesribeiro> and, ofc, true tcp:// or http:// endpoints
39 [2017-01-07T01:41:41] <galvesribeiro> so it can be accessed over network
40 [2017-01-07T01:41:48] <galvesribeiro> yes, the docker port will be open on the host
41 [2017-01-07T01:42:07] <galvesribeiro> and it is work of the IT guys to manage traffic to and from those nodes with firewall
42 [2017-01-07T01:42:22] <galvesribeiro> so, again, I have 2 hosts
43 [2017-01-07T01:42:33] <galvesribeiro> 1 master, 1 worker
44 [2017-01-07T01:42:50] <galvesribeiro> I have 1 container which can be hosted on any of those hosts
45 [2017-01-07T01:43:22] <galvesribeiro> can I access [<-LINK->] (for example) from inside the container?
46 [2017-01-07T01:43:38] <SISheogorath> if it is exposed, yes
47 [2017-01-07T01:43:58] <galvesribeiro> by exposed you mean the docker port is open on the master host's firewayy, correct?
48 [2017-01-07T01:44:07] <SISheogorath> yes
49 [2017-01-07T01:44:54] <galvesribeiro> ok, assuming it, and it WILL be (otherwise swarm cluster nodes will never connect to it), I don't see why it is not working here
50 [2017-01-07T01:45:35] <galvesribeiro> the same concept should apply if you have no swarm, just a regular docker host standalone
51 [2017-01-07T01:47:24] <galvesribeiro> let me try something here
52 [2017-01-07T01:52:17] <SISheogorath> sure
53 [2017-01-07T02:39:20] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: looks like the security problem can be handled by those plugins :) [<-LINK->]
54 [2017-01-07T02:42:12] <SISheogorath> looks nice. I wasn't aware of the--authorization-plugin=[]-option :D
55 [2017-01-07T02:42:40] <galvesribeiro> yeah, looks like you can implement one yourself to provide fine grained authorization or fine some other around
56 [2017-01-07T02:43:08] <SISheogorath> I still prefer the old way, but if it works for you perfect :) I'm happy to see that you have found a solution which fits your needs
57 [2017-01-07T02:43:24] <galvesribeiro> yeah, I still didn't hehehe
58 [2017-01-07T02:43:28] <galvesribeiro> I still have 2 problems
59 [2017-01-07T02:44:07] <galvesribeiro> connect the container to docker remote API and find a good way to healthcheck the application inside the container from other containers :D
60 [2017-01-07T02:46:58] <SISheogorath> first is easy. You define your manager nodes. they are static. so you can add a rr DNS entry which addresses the manager nodes in your environment
61 [2017-01-07T02:48:31] <galvesribeiro> ok but do I need swarm? I mean, if I'm on a developer machine, can't I use regular docker daemon for that?
62 [2017-01-07T02:51:34] <SISheogorath> For the second one I'm still not sure what kind of health check you want to do a HTTP call with a predefined result to see that your API is working or a correct html page is the output or run some kind of weird script that does something idk. Maybe you can explain your use case a bit more.And the swarm API is a bit different than the pur docker API. But if you really want you can run Swarm as 1 node setup. So there is not a big problem to access the same API like you would do in production
63 [2017-01-07T02:51:37] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
64 [2017-01-07T02:51:54] <galvesribeiro> left side is the container
65 [2017-01-07T02:51:59] <galvesribeiro> right side my local machine
66 [2017-01-07T02:52:11] <galvesribeiro> I tried connect to all known ips of my host machine
67 [2017-01-07T02:52:16] <galvesribeiro> none connect from the container
68 [2017-01-07T02:52:46] <SISheogorath> netstat -anshows that the port is open?
69 [2017-01-07T02:54:16] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
70 [2017-01-07T02:54:21] <galvesribeiro> yeah, windows firewall is also disabled just to be sure
71 [2017-01-07T02:54:35] <SISheogorath> that IP is localhost
72 [2017-01-07T02:54:35] <galvesribeiro> on my machine, I can connect just fine
73 [2017-01-07T02:54:37] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
74 [2017-01-07T02:55:09] <SISheogorath> for sure you can\'t connect to it using a "remote" container :D you have to expose it on an external IP :D
75 [2017-01-07T02:55:21] <galvesribeiro> hmm
76 [2017-01-07T02:55:23] <galvesribeiro> make sense
77 [2017-01-07T02:55:32] <galvesribeiro> so I need to start the daemon with a diff config?
78 [2017-01-07T02:55:39] <SISheogorath> yes
79 [2017-01-07T02:57:12] <galvesribeiro> let me check
80 [2017-01-07T02:57:46] <SISheogorath> Oh my got I had such a great idea :D :D :D Have to build a test setup :o
81 [2017-01-07T02:57:55] <galvesribeiro> lol
82 [2017-01-07T02:58:11] <galvesribeiro> may I ask what is it? :P
83 [2017-01-07T02:58:16] <galvesribeiro> (curious)
84 [2017-01-07T03:00:01] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
85 [2017-01-07T03:00:11] <galvesribeiro> that should do if my docker doesn't explode :P
86 [2017-01-07T03:02:35] <SISheogorath> you can run a API request on container healthcheck which validates you your external output :D but As I noticed a few seconds ago in this case you can also do a simple internal health check. Because you know docker works (as container). and external validation can hit any other container as there is a traffic rounting mesh between the nodes
87 [2017-01-07T03:03:37] <SISheogorath> is your host still alive? :D
88 [2017-01-07T03:03:41] <galvesribeiro> no
89 [2017-01-07T03:03:43] <galvesribeiro> it doesn't
90 [2017-01-07T03:03:44] <galvesribeiro> heheheh
91 [2017-01-07T03:04:00] <galvesribeiro> it is saying that I'm using the hosts as a flag and in the config file
92 [2017-01-07T03:04:11] <galvesribeiro> I'm not seeing where is this flag
93 [2017-01-07T03:04:17] <SISheogorath> -H
94 [2017-01-07T03:04:27] <galvesribeiro> yeah but who did that? o.O
95 [2017-01-07T03:04:33] <galvesribeiro> it is installed with docker for windows
96 [2017-01-07T03:04:38] <galvesribeiro> need to check on that
97 [2017-01-07T03:05:34] <SISheogorath> ew yes :D saw it in your screenshots :D I try to avoid windows and docker :X :D In case of docker for windows you have to do some weird things because it runs inside a HyperV VM :D
98 [2017-01-07T03:05:47] <galvesribeiro> nop
99 [2017-01-07T03:05:47] <SISheogorath> (if you use linux containers)
100 [2017-01-07T03:05:49] <galvesribeiro> it doesn't
101 [2017-01-07T03:05:52] <galvesribeiro> AH ok
102 [2017-01-07T03:05:56] <galvesribeiro> linux :P
103 [2017-01-07T03:06:02] <galvesribeiro> but our case everything is windows
104 [2017-01-07T03:06:07] <galvesribeiro> containers, hosts, etc
105 [2017-01-07T03:06:51] <SISheogorath> ew okay I have to say that I know windows "well" but not docker on Windows. it was always too much magic for me :D for serverside things I stay on linux :D
106 [2017-01-07T03:07:02] <galvesribeiro> heheheeh
107 [2017-01-07T03:07:19] <galvesribeiro> I used to be on your side many many years ago
108 [2017-01-07T03:07:24] <galvesribeiro> tired of suffering :P
109 [2017-01-07T03:09:22] <SISheogorath> I was Windows Domain admin for 3 years it was nice, I had a lot of fun, weird issues and in most case a reboot fixed it but I really have to say doing things like containers on linux is a lot more enjoyable. :DI can only speak for my self :D
110 [2017-01-07T03:09:58] <galvesribeiro> yeah, it may be a lot easier today... windows is just starting with containers...
111 [2017-01-07T03:10:11] <galvesribeiro> lets see later on when we have System Center and other tooling for it
112 [2017-01-07T03:10:18] <galvesribeiro> but no, I'm not a sysadmin :D
113 [2017-01-07T03:11:01] <galvesribeiro> btw, where in earth should I change to set the-H...
114 [2017-01-07T03:11:02] <SISheogorath> let's try something new :D
115 [2017-01-07T03:11:11] <SISheogorath> I have an idea how to solve it :D
116 [2017-01-07T03:11:18] <galvesribeiro> solve what?
117 [2017-01-07T03:11:36] <SISheogorath> the listen problem :D
118 [2017-01-07T03:12:58] <galvesribeiro> ah ok
119 [2017-01-07T03:13:09] <galvesribeiro> I have so many problems to fix with docker and Orleans :D
120 [2017-01-07T03:13:36] <SISheogorath> netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2375 listenaddress=<place one of you external ips here> connectport=2375 connectaddress=127.0.0.1run this as administrator in a cmd.exe should forward the port from the external address to the localhost port so you can access it
121 [2017-01-07T03:13:55] <SISheogorath> but if someone ask I didn't do anything :D
122 [2017-01-07T03:14:12] <galvesribeiro> lol
123 [2017-01-07T03:14:44] <galvesribeiro> but that is for my dev machine, what about in a real environment?
124 [2017-01-07T03:16:16] <SISheogorath> In theory you can use it here too. It's hacky but it should work :D On linux it would be so simple :/ It's like using the sledgehammer
125 [2017-01-07T03:16:26] <galvesribeiro> lol
126 [2017-01-07T03:16:52] <galvesribeiro> what about chaning dockerd parameters to accept 0.0.0.0, would that work?
127 [2017-01-07T03:18:37] <SISheogorath> maybe. On windows server it works different than docker for windows. But that's another story :D
128 [2017-01-07T03:18:46] <galvesribeiro> hehehe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T03:23:03] <SISheogorath> The problem I have with docker containers based on windows... even the "nano-windows-server" has >4GB :D I mean What the hell? I can build a gigantic application on a overloaded debian base image and it takes 1.3GB or 1.5GB :D (that\'s the biggest image I had until now)  And I\'m still far away from the BASE IMAGE :D
2 [2017-01-07T03:23:27] <galvesribeiro> yup
3 [2017-01-07T03:23:34] <galvesribeiro> windows images are by far bigger than linux
4 [2017-01-07T03:23:39] <galvesribeiro> the smaller has 400mb
5 [2017-01-07T03:23:53] <galvesribeiro> but they are working to reduce it
6 [2017-01-07T03:24:19] <galvesribeiro> nanoserver started at 800mb... few months after its announcement down to 500mb, and now 400mb
7 [2017-01-07T03:24:23] <galvesribeiro> they will improve it
8 [2017-01-07T03:24:43] <galvesribeiro> current NT kernel is very big
9 [2017-01-07T03:24:49] <galvesribeiro> cant compare with linux kernel
10 [2017-01-07T03:25:38] <galvesribeiro> it does a lot more (than it should) than linux one... Many things could be safely moved today to user-mode... I think they will eventually do it
11 [2017-01-07T03:36:45] <SISheogorath> oh yes they dropt the size dramatically since my last visit
12 [2017-01-07T03:37:09] <SISheogorath> but I still prefer my 5MB (unzipped) alpine image :D
13 [2017-01-07T03:37:23] <galvesribeiro> jisus
14 [2017-01-07T03:37:29] <galvesribeiro> I though it was 40mb :P
15 [2017-01-07T03:38:20] <galvesribeiro> I think I screw up my docker install :(
16 [2017-01-07T03:38:32] <SISheogorath> what did you do?
17 [2017-01-07T03:38:48] <galvesribeiro> tried to dosc config com.docker.service binpath= "\\"C:\\Program Files\\docker\\docker\\Docker for Windows.exe\\" --run-service -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"
18 [2017-01-07T03:39:10] <galvesribeiro> now I forgot to take a note on what the previews parameters were
19 [2017-01-07T03:39:11] <SISheogorath> oh okay no idea about it :D
20 [2017-01-07T03:39:25] <galvesribeiro> it makes the service pass parameters at start time
21 [2017-01-07T03:39:28] <galvesribeiro> crap
22 [2017-01-07T03:39:34] <galvesribeiro> let me reinstall it quickly
23 [2017-01-07T03:39:37] <SISheogorath> (in worst case you can do what every windows user does) reinstall
24 [2017-01-07T03:39:38] <SISheogorath> :D
25 [2017-01-07T03:40:01] <SISheogorath> 2 people 1 thought
26 [2017-01-07T03:40:07] <galvesribeiro> :)
27 [2017-01-07T03:40:35] <galvesribeiro> I'm seriously think on install it manually now
28 [2017-01-07T03:40:37] <galvesribeiro> without the installer
29 [2017-01-07T03:40:42] <galvesribeiro> so I can control dockerd.exe
30 [2017-01-07T03:41:44] <galvesribeiro> nvm
31 [2017-01-07T03:41:50] <galvesribeiro> it is only available on windows server 2016 :(
32 [2017-01-07T03:43:08] <SISheogorath> I see
33 [2017-01-07T03:43:39] <galvesribeiro> let me grab the installer
34 [2017-01-07T03:43:40] <galvesribeiro> dammit
35 [2017-01-07T03:43:46] <galvesribeiro> there must be a way :(
36 [2017-01-07T03:45:55] <SISheogorath> maybe you can ask in the [<-LINK->] the slack community has a nice #docker-for-windows channel
37 [2017-01-07T03:54:43] <galvesribeiro> waiting for pending approval
38 [2017-01-07T03:54:45] <galvesribeiro> :(
39 [2017-01-07T03:55:36] <SISheogorath> yeah :/ it can take a moment. But once you has been approve it's a lot of fun :)
40 [2017-01-07T03:55:45] <galvesribeiro> nice
41 [2017-01-07T04:05:11] <galvesribeiro> ok, my docker is back
42 [2017-01-07T04:05:14] <galvesribeiro> now lets try not break it
43 [2017-01-07T04:05:50] <galvesribeiro> Docker daemon failed with message:\nunable to configure the Docker daemon with file C:\\ProgramData\\docker\\config\\daemon.json: the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file: hosts: (from flag: [npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine_windows], from file: [tcp://0.0.0.0 http://0.0.0.0])
44 [2017-01-07T04:08:55] <SISheogorath> in this case clear theC:\\ProgramData\\docker\\config\\daemon.json
45 [2017-01-07T04:09:08] <galvesribeiro> yes, that is when I try to change it
46 [2017-01-07T04:09:18] <galvesribeiro> if I remove it, it run fine
47 [2017-01-07T04:09:25] <galvesribeiro> but I want to change the host :D
48 [2017-01-07T04:10:18] <SISheogorath> check your services. looks like there is a variable passed ^^
49 [2017-01-07T04:11:12] <galvesribeiro> there isn't :(
50 [2017-01-07T04:11:15] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
51 [2017-01-07T04:26:27] <galvesribeiro> I'll try your netsh hack for now
52 [2017-01-07T04:26:48] <galvesribeiro> pulling images again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T04:42:10] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: dumb question... I'm totally ignorant about kubernetes... is it an orchestration tech that run on top of Docker (like swarm) or is it a different container tech?
2 [2017-01-07T04:43:08] <SISheogorath> K8s is a ochestration solution using docker as container engine. But can also use others.
3 [2017-01-07T04:43:22] <galvesribeiro> ok, nice
4 [2017-01-07T04:43:36] <galvesribeiro> I wonder if they have more "open" APIs and if it uses windows
5 [2017-01-07T04:43:52] <galvesribeiro> btw, now I know whatK8means! lol :P
6 [2017-01-07T04:44:05] <SISheogorath> works well for big deployments. But is oversized for setups with less than 10 nodes (personal opinion).
7 [2017-01-07T04:44:12] <galvesribeiro> humm
8 [2017-01-07T04:44:13] <galvesribeiro> ic
9 [2017-01-07T04:44:37] <galvesribeiro> maybe is time for a midsize orchestration tech! hehehe
10 [2017-01-07T04:45:02] <galvesribeiro> major problem is to create and manage the overlay network
11 [2017-01-07T04:45:06] <galvesribeiro> its all software based
12 [2017-01-07T04:45:12] <SISheogorath> They have another (opener) API :D as they don't utilize the docker.socket to communicate with the ochestrator
13 [2017-01-07T04:45:53] <galvesribeiro> so tons of tcp/upd sockets have to be implemented to make a virtual network across multiple hosts...
14 [2017-01-07T04:45:54] <SISheogorath> not really you can use "network drivers" in docker which communicate with you infrastructure to setup something like vlans
15 [2017-01-07T04:46:04] <galvesribeiro> hummm
16 [2017-01-07T04:46:50] <galvesribeiro> in all cases, the big win of swarm over the other IMHO is that you don't need to install anything else
17 [2017-01-07T04:46:58] <galvesribeiro> just have to have docker
18 [2017-01-07T04:47:37] <galvesribeiro> and major docker players like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, will not allow you to install a new orchestrator on their hosts for obvious reasons...
19 [2017-01-07T04:48:28] <galvesribeiro> and everywhere I only hear people talking about swarm...
20 [2017-01-07T04:49:06] <SISheogorath> not true :D AWS provides K8s as a service :D
21 [2017-01-07T04:49:25] <galvesribeiro> OH! true
22 [2017-01-07T04:49:52] <galvesribeiro> but in all cases, Swarm looks like the mostfamousone
23 [2017-01-07T04:52:44] <SISheogorath> because docker swarm-mode still has some problems (a lot getting fixed in 1.13) means missing some important featues K8s is still more popular than docker swarm-mode in production. But as mentioned for small setups docker swarm is way more attractive and easy to use.
24 [2017-01-07T04:53:09] <galvesribeiro> humm
25 [2017-01-07T04:53:12] <galvesribeiro> ic
26 [2017-01-07T04:53:43] <galvesribeiro> I'm 1.13.0-rc5 :) hope that problems get fixed :P
27 [2017-01-07T04:55:25] <SISheogorath> right now I still missing good multi datacenter support. Which is nicely provided by K8s and allows you to manage multiple geolocations easily
28 [2017-01-07T04:55:43] <galvesribeiro> I though Docker Cloud already do that
29 [2017-01-07T04:57:03] <SISheogorath> Not sure I'm not a Docker Cloud user
30 [2017-01-07T04:57:16] <galvesribeiro> they claime to do that
31 [2017-01-07T05:09:10] <SISheogorath> In this case they do :D
32 [2017-01-07T05:09:29] <galvesribeiro> :P
33 [2017-01-07T05:11:17] <galvesribeiro> Oh! Azure has Kubernetes as well :)
34 [2017-01-07T05:11:35] <SISheogorath> I was expecting that :D
35 [2017-01-07T05:11:58] <galvesribeiro> do you know if it can run on windows machines? I mean, like a dev machine?
36 [2017-01-07T05:12:18] <SISheogorath> iirc there was a annoncement a few days ago
37 [2017-01-07T05:12:19] <galvesribeiro> (I'll will read the docs later, just wnat to set my expectations)
38 [2017-01-07T05:12:25] <galvesribeiro> humm good
39 [2017-01-07T05:12:27] <galvesribeiro> let me check :D
40 [2017-01-07T05:15:29] <killerspaz> galvesribeiro: i hope you're gonna blog this stuff :P
41 [2017-01-07T05:16:14] <killerspaz> lol and your eventual success, of course!
42 [2017-01-07T05:17:17] <galvesribeiro> I hope so :D
43 [2017-01-07T05:17:35] <galvesribeiro> btw, not finding anything about kubernetes on windows :(
44 [2017-01-07T05:18:30] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
45 [2017-01-07T05:18:32] <galvesribeiro> found that
46 [2017-01-07T05:25:57] <galvesribeiro> looks like kube is only for windows server 2016 and still require a linux machine for its control plane
47 [2017-01-07T05:25:58] <galvesribeiro> :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T05:15:56] <galvesribeiro> blog what? my failure getting docker to work with Orleans? :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T05:55:08] <nischay30> hey whats the difference between docker deploy and docker stack deploy?
2 [2017-01-07T05:55:36] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: the netsh hack worked :P
3 [2017-01-07T05:55:52] <galvesribeiro> thank you!
4 [2017-01-07T05:56:11] <galvesribeiro> the problem is that it will not work on any other hosts hehehe
5 [2017-01-07T05:56:17] <galvesribeiro> I mean, AWS, Azure etc
6 [2017-01-07T05:56:18] <galvesribeiro> :P
7 [2017-01-07T05:57:33] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: you'll fix that soon :D
8 [2017-01-07T05:57:39] <galvesribeiro> hahahahahaa
9 [2017-01-07T05:57:44] <galvesribeiro> I wish I could
10 [2017-01-07T05:57:59] <SISheogorath> I should blog about it :D
11 [2017-01-07T05:58:26] <galvesribeiro> in all cases, I opened that [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-01-07T05:58:32] <galvesribeiro> maybe someone jump in
13 [2017-01-07T05:58:59] <galvesribeiro> I changed thelistenaddressto 0.0.0.0
14 [2017-01-07T05:59:04] <galvesribeiro> instead of use a fixed API
15 [2017-01-07T05:59:09] <galvesribeiro> (DHCP hell)
16 [2017-01-07T05:59:36] <SISheogorath> nischay30: check [<-LINK->]
17 [2017-01-07T06:00:00] <SISheogorath> hope that's enough ;)
18 [2017-01-07T06:00:51] <nischay30> thanks@SISheogorath
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T06:02:08] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: if I create a swarm cluster with my own machine, can I destroy it later?
2 [2017-01-07T06:02:32] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: yes, usedocker swarm leave -f
3 [2017-01-07T06:02:38] <nischay30> galvesribeiro: You can't destroy a swarm..You can leave the swarm
4 [2017-01-07T06:02:39] <galvesribeiro> good
5 [2017-01-07T06:35:49] <galvesribeiro> hummm docker swarm managers have an implementation of Raft in it
6 [2017-01-07T06:36:04] <galvesribeiro> I wonder if we can access it thru swarm APIs :P
7 [2017-01-07T06:36:08] <galvesribeiro> lets keep reading
8 [2017-01-07T06:49:53] <SISheogorath> why do you want to access it?
9 [2017-01-07T06:51:08] <galvesribeiro> we have a raft provider in Orleans as well... so we could "maybe" leverage its codebase and make the health consensus to use Docker one... Idk, just a guess... I\'m pretty sure it is exclusive for docker swarm
10 [2017-01-07T06:52:01] <galvesribeiro> I readed that the classic sward relied on Zookeeper or Consul to maintain its membership
11 [2017-01-07T06:52:23] <galvesribeiro> so they probably removed that dependency by implementing a private Raft cluster themselves
12 [2017-01-07T06:56:44] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: i'd read it
13 [2017-01-07T06:58:14] <SISheogorath> ehhh okay, not sure what you're referring to
14 [2017-01-07T07:05:30] <galvesribeiro> calleddocker swarm initand it is taking a while and don't finished
15 [2017-01-07T07:07:48] <SISheogorath> sounds wrong
16 [2017-01-07T07:08:41] <galvesribeiro> I'm with experimental and 1.13 rc5
17 [2017-01-07T07:08:45] <galvesribeiro> the update came today
18 [2017-01-07T07:08:52] <galvesribeiro> I did a ctr+c to cancel
19 [2017-01-07T07:08:56] <galvesribeiro> and look at this
20 [2017-01-07T07:09:16] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
21 [2017-01-07T07:09:31] <SISheogorath> trydocker node ls

23 [2017-01-07T07:10:07] <SISheogorath> if you see something (like your node) it worked
24 [2017-01-07T07:10:17] <SISheogorath> looks fine
25 [2017-01-07T07:10:54] <SISheogorath> oh didn't open it :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T07:08:22] <nischay30> try docker experimental or docker 1.13 version and do docker swarm init..it willwork
2 [2017-01-07T07:10:08] <nischay30> galvesribeiro: first do docker swarm leave --force
3 [2017-01-07T07:10:13] <nischay30> and then show your docker info
4 [2017-01-07T07:10:28] <galvesribeiro> down?
5 [2017-01-07T07:10:59] <galvesribeiro> hehehe
6 [2017-01-07T07:11:06] <galvesribeiro> let me try leave first
7 [2017-01-07T07:11:23] <nischay30> yes leave first with force and show your docker info
8 [2017-01-07T07:11:26] <galvesribeiro> node left the swarm
9 [2017-01-07T07:11:59] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-01-07T07:13:42] <nischay30> ok...
11 [2017-01-07T07:14:06] <nischay30> now try to run docker swarm init --advertise-addr='IP'
12 [2017-01-07T07:14:18] <galvesribeiro> I did with 127.0.0.1
13 [2017-01-07T07:14:30] <SISheogorath> ew that's a bad idea
14 [2017-01-07T07:14:40] <galvesribeiro> the problem is that I have 5 diff networks that I join
15 [2017-01-07T07:14:48] <galvesribeiro> all them are DHCP :(
16 [2017-01-07T07:14:51] <nischay30> ok ok...no issue..
17 [2017-01-07T07:15:00] <nischay30> now show docker info
18 [2017-01-07T07:15:11] <galvesribeiro> again?
19 [2017-01-07T07:15:17] <nischay30> yes
20 [2017-01-07T07:15:27] <galvesribeiro> you mean after the swarm command?
21 [2017-01-07T07:16:03] <nischay30> yes
22 [2017-01-07T07:16:25] <galvesribeiro> running the init
23 [2017-01-07T07:17:58] <galvesribeiro> ...
24 [2017-01-07T07:18:06] <nischay30> ?
25 [2017-01-07T07:19:46] <galvesribeiro> still blocked on the swarm init
26 [2017-01-07T07:20:19] <nischay30> show docker info
27 [2017-01-07T07:20:25] <galvesribeiro> it is blocked
28 [2017-01-07T07:20:33] <galvesribeiro> still running the init
29 [2017-01-07T07:20:46] <nischay30> let me try with the new version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T07:18:23] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: saying i'd read the blog post exploring this discussion.. Something succinct with a focus. There's a ton of information here that could be explored in detail
2 [2017-01-07T07:21:43] <SISheogorath> nischay30: don't forget that he's using docker for Windows
3 [2017-01-07T07:22:17] <killerspaz> not docker toolbox for windows, literally docker FOR windows
4 [2017-01-07T07:22:34] <galvesribeiro> the latest and native docker, for windows
5 [2017-01-07T07:22:35] <galvesribeiro> :)
6 [2017-01-07T07:22:57] <killerspaz> I'm not a windows server guy, but I'm really fascinated by this exploration
7 [2017-01-07T07:23:27] <killerspaz> Azure is very appealing, MS is very prominent in Austin and pushes it very hard
8 [2017-01-07T07:23:58] <galvesribeiro> I'll write a blog about it here [<-LINK->] with my journey :P
9 [2017-01-07T07:24:27] <killerspaz> wait, are you the Orleans dev?
10 [2017-01-07T07:24:39] <galvesribeiro> I'm one of the contributors
11 [2017-01-07T07:24:45] <killerspaz> nice
12 [2017-01-07T07:24:51] <galvesribeiro> I'm no on Microsoft anymore
13 [2017-01-07T07:25:01] <galvesribeiro> but still have a good relationship there :)
14 [2017-01-07T07:25:07] <killerspaz> please post when you do!
15 [2017-01-07T07:25:13] <galvesribeiro> sure ;)
16 [2017-01-07T07:25:26] <SISheogorath> :o that explains why you are so focused on Windows :D
17 [2017-01-07T07:25:33] <killerspaz> hehe shhh
18 [2017-01-07T07:25:34] <galvesribeiro> hahahahaha
19 [2017-01-07T07:25:37] <galvesribeiro> :P
20 [2017-01-07T07:25:52] <galvesribeiro> I worked several years ago on IBM with linux
21 [2017-01-07T07:26:09] <galvesribeiro> thanks gosh I left this world :P
22 [2017-01-07T07:26:16] <nischay30> lol
23 [2017-01-07T07:26:24] <killerspaz> I love both honestly.... Fuck osx
24 [2017-01-07T07:26:31] <killerspaz> and bsd for that matter
25 [2017-01-07T07:26:51] <killerspaz> My opinions are that of my own
26 [2017-01-07T07:26:53] <galvesribeiro> O not even mention that thing :P
27 [2017-01-07T07:26:56] <killerspaz> lol
28 [2017-01-07T07:27:33] <galvesribeiro>  [<-ISSUE->] is the issue I'm tracking with Docker for Orleans and here my PR [<-LINK->]
29 [2017-01-07T07:28:09] <galvesribeiro> both are part of a huge effort to bring Orleans to Linux and other cloud services provider natively
30 [2017-01-07T07:29:15] <galvesribeiro> specially now that we almost finished the first part of .net core port [<-ISSUE->]
31 [2017-01-07T07:29:26] <galvesribeiro> hehehehehe
32 [2017-01-07T07:33:51] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
33 [2017-01-07T07:34:23] <galvesribeiro> that simple code in Orleans means that each of those actor tasks will run in a diff silo (a node/server in the cluster) and you get the result back
34 [2017-01-07T07:34:35] <galvesribeiro> it is wonderful :D
35 [2017-01-07T07:35:03] <galvesribeiro> my next fun project will be write Orleans fully in TypeScript for node.js :D
36 [2017-01-07T07:36:22] <galvesribeiro> let give node community some real distributed framework :D
37 [2017-01-07T07:38:58] <killerspaz> <3 TS. Ready for ES9 by now.... let's get to a real language! :P
38 [2017-01-07T07:42:24] <killerspaz> true, it's pretty useful, too
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T07:29:16] <SISheogorath> I don't know all those microsoft languages tends to have ultra long names for their methods and objects
2 [2017-01-07T07:30:17] <SISheogorath> same applies to commandline programs :(dirvsls
3 [2017-01-07T07:30:28] <killerspaz> c# is one of my favorite standards
4 [2017-01-07T07:31:06] <killerspaz> i love mono and what they've done for the language; .Net is also pretty great with some of the past few years' advancement
5 [2017-01-07T07:31:28] <killerspaz> their async/await stuff in 4.5+ is just mindblowing
6 [2017-01-07T07:31:45] <galvesribeiro> yup
7 [2017-01-07T07:32:02] <galvesribeiro> Orleans is fully based on async/await and tasks in a distributed fashion
8 [2017-01-07T07:33:14] <SISheogorath> I have native C++ or NodeJS for that :D
9 [2017-01-07T07:33:30] <SISheogorath> sometimes in combination \\o/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T07:40:32] <SISheogorath> oh yes! but we have to mention that in general nodejs already includes a cluster framework :D so not sure how useful it is :D But I'll give it a try
2 [2017-01-07T07:43:50] <galvesribeiro> cluster in node is not a real cluster
3 [2017-01-07T07:44:12] <galvesribeiro> it is just a proxy/main process which spawn other process and forward requests to be processed there
4 [2017-01-07T07:44:26] <galvesribeiro> node (because of V8 and libUV) has a single thread
5 [2017-01-07T07:44:37] <galvesribeiro> so each node.exe process is 1 single thread
6 [2017-01-07T07:45:11] <galvesribeiro> what cluster does is multiplex that thread with diff process at cost of serialization and marshaling between process
7 [2017-01-07T07:45:36] <galvesribeiro> so you basically have 1+CPUThreadCount node processes per machine
8 [2017-01-07T07:45:39] <galvesribeiro> this is their cluster
9 [2017-01-07T08:00:00] <galvesribeiro> and my docker swarm init still running :(
10 [2017-01-07T08:03:01] <galvesribeiro> ok... its almost 6am here and I'm fighting this thing
11 [2017-01-07T08:03:04] <galvesribeiro> time to sleep
12 [2017-01-07T08:03:17] <galvesribeiro> night all bb tomorrow and thanks for all help again
13 [2017-01-07T08:03:54] <galvesribeiro> yeah
14 [2017-01-07T08:04:08] <galvesribeiro> but that is just usefull for stateless request/response kind of app
15 [2017-01-07T08:04:21] <galvesribeiro> like web servers and maybe websocket server
16 [2017-01-07T08:04:27] <galvesribeiro> but you can't do much with that
17 [2017-01-07T08:04:56] <galvesribeiro> when I find time will start the project and let you know
18 [2017-01-07T08:05:10] <galvesribeiro> anyway, ttyl night
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T08:03:32] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: yes, that's how nodes cluster works :D and you can build a abstraction over it to add remote nodes too :D it was very easy and very useful as we simply passed API requests trough it and ended up in nicely scaling setup
2 [2017-01-07T08:03:38] <SISheogorath> See you
3 [2017-01-07T08:05:49] <SISheogorath>  I'm waiting for it ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T08:44:28] <nischay30> how to define links in docker-compose file if i want to deploy on the warm
2 [2017-01-07T08:44:30] <nischay30> swarm
3 [2017-01-07T08:45:20] <SISheogorath> you should not use links in this case. Address the services and may add network aliases
4 [2017-01-07T08:46:08] <nischay30> means how??i m not getting you..like i m having 3 service ..one is redis ,another one is neo4j and third one my nodejs app which has to run on 8081
5 [2017-01-07T08:48:52] <nischay30> ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T08:56:15] <SISheogorath> oh wait you talk about compose v3?
2 [2017-01-07T08:56:31] <nischay30> yes i m talking about that
3 [2017-01-07T08:57:07] <nischay30> i dont know how to write compose version 3.but i have to user version  3 so that i cn deploy a stack in docker 1.13 using compose nt bundle
4 [2017-01-07T08:57:23] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-07T08:57:42] <SISheogorath> should be a nice example
6 [2017-01-07T08:58:06] <nischay30> ok i will explore...thanx
7 [2017-01-07T09:12:46] <nischay30> SISheogorath: but tell me i m having one environment vairable in nodejs app i.e.neo4j Url and i have to mention it in that and i have to refer that neo4j.so without links how i mention that?
8 [2017-01-07T09:14:36] <SISheogorath> set the url to the servicename of your neo4j service. if you name it "foo" use " [<-LINK->] " as url. docker swarm networking will do the rest
9 [2017-01-07T09:17:18] <nischay30> is it necessary that  i have to define the network also?
10 [2017-01-07T12:59:05] <SISheogorath> yes
11 [2017-01-09T09:28:19] <nischay30> netw0rm: i am using
12 [2017-01-09T09:29:00] <nischay30> could anyone tell me how to start one service after 10seconds of particular service in new docker-compose
13 [2017-01-09T09:33:49] <nischay30> avinash2888: mention the port forwarding in docker-compose file
14 [2017-01-09T09:45:41] <SISheogorath> avinash2888:  [<-LINK->]
15 [2017-01-09T10:11:27] <SISheogorath> Oh@nischay30didn't know that. But makes sense. The official docs doesn't say anything new about depends_on. But they always tell you to follow this: [<-LINK->]
16 [2017-01-09T10:12:56] <nischay30> SISheogorath:  [<-LINK->] go here and find depends_on
17 [2017-01-09T10:14:32] <SISheogorath> That's about compose file version 2.1 not 3
18 [2017-01-09T10:14:58] <SISheogorath> For swarm deployments you need docker compose file version 3
19 [2017-01-09T10:14:59] <nischay30> just read the note belowe that line
20 [2017-01-09T10:15:19] <SISheogorath> Yes I did
21 [2017-01-09T10:56:30] <nischay30> seriously i was not able to find what i should put instead on depends_on
22 [2017-01-09T11:12:24] <SISheogorath> milanvdmria: try to check thatpwdis the correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T15:39:00] <galvesribeiro> Afternoon!
2 [2017-01-07T17:09:04] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: the swarm init never worked :(
3 [2017-01-07T17:11:36] <galvesribeiro> nop... got one email from Victor Coisne saying in other words, wait :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T17:10:31] <SISheogorath>  I have no real idea why this happens. Are you know part of the docker community?
2 [2017-01-07T17:17:56] <SISheogorath> Oh okay :o that's new
3 [2017-01-07T17:20:28] <galvesribeiro> the chat is probably too bloated
4 [2017-01-07T17:20:41] <galvesribeiro> so they are controlling access now unfortunately :(
5 [2017-01-07T17:33:29] <galvesribeiro> frustrating
6 [2017-01-07T17:39:31] <SISheogorath> I aggree with that but I currently have no idea. Maybe you can file an issue on github
7 [2017-01-07T17:40:31] <galvesribeiro> nah, don't want be an 4ss... let them take their time...
8 [2017-01-07T17:41:08] <galvesribeiro> regardless of swarm, I still have the Orleans <-> Docker stuff to deal with
9 [2017-01-07T17:42:39] <galvesribeiro> I read thru whole swarm docs yesterday (or Today? Who knows!) before sleep... it is very simple and has not much for my case actually
10 [2017-01-07T17:44:10] <galvesribeiro> the Orleans cluster deployment is not actually related to swarm... the only feature of swarm that is actually used but totally unrelated, is the placement strategy of containers on hosts and the desired state... thats it... load balancing etc, those things we will never use
11 [2017-01-07T17:45:07] <galvesribeiro> so a single standalone docker host or a swarm cluster makes no diff for me... what we care are the labels and find a way to proper health check the service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T20:22:19] <vyscond> Hey guys! is it possible to point to anotherdocker-compose.ymlfile  withdocker-composecommand just like we withdocker build?
2 [2017-01-07T20:25:24] <galvesribeiro> vyscond: use-fjust as indocker build
3 [2017-01-07T20:25:43] <galvesribeiro> docker-compose up -f somefile.yml
4 [2017-01-07T20:25:57] <vyscond> galvesribeiro: thanks a million sport!
5 [2017-01-07T20:26:56] <galvesribeiro> vyscond: most of docker commands just havedocker [command] --helpso the majority of parameters are there
6 [2017-01-07T20:27:51] <vyscond> galvesribeiro: yup. but i forgot to run that underdocker-composealone. Instead i wasdocker-compose up --help. :/
7 [2017-01-07T20:28:58] <galvesribeiro> you are right
8 [2017-01-07T20:29:17] <vyscond> omg man, i was starting believing i was blind@_@
9 [2017-01-07T20:29:21] <galvesribeiro> ahhaahah
10 [2017-01-07T20:29:22] <galvesribeiro> :D
11 [2017-01-07T20:29:24] <galvesribeiro> sorry
12 [2017-01-07T20:29:37] <galvesribeiro> I did run here before I reply you
13 [2017-01-07T20:29:46] <galvesribeiro> just forgot to check which of commands had it, sorry :P
14 [2017-01-07T20:30:22] <vyscond> galvesribeiro: cool. thanks a million again mate :3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-07T22:11:22] <galvesribeiro> guys
2 [2017-01-07T22:11:26] <galvesribeiro> according to that: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-01-07T22:11:48] <galvesribeiro> filters – a JSON encoded value of the filters (a map[string][]string) to process on the images list.
4 [2017-01-07T22:12:09] <galvesribeiro> does anyone have an example of that json?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-08T13:14:26] <jjohnson1994> Hello, I want to be able to clone a repo into my docker container at run time. Because I'm using SSH to get read-only access to my repo I need to have the keys within the docker container somewhere. Is it safe to keep the public and private keys within the containers files and then link the volume in the docker-compose file? or should I be doing this another way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-08T13:54:29] <SISheogorath> jjohnson1994: it depends on your "secretness". If it\'s a deployment key and it\'s not a problem if everyone has it. Include it. If it is a problem, you can thing aboutmount the key to container\nadd it as environment variables\nwait vor 1.13 and add it as secret
2 [2017-01-08T13:57:56] <jjohnson1994> SISheogorath: It's just a deployment key so should be okay, thanks
3 [2017-01-08T13:58:44] <SISheogorath> You can think about it like about "would I include that into  my github repository" ;)
4 [2017-01-08T18:31:20] <SISheogorath> \\o/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-08T16:04:32] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-08T16:06:00] <galvesribeiro> when I do adocker inspect imageIdOrNamewhat is the difference between the objects insideConfigandContainerConfig?
2 [2017-01-08T16:06:54] <galvesribeiro> I'm calling this [<-LINK->] and according to their sample, we have dupplicated fields on both cases
3 [2017-01-08T16:07:59] <galvesribeiro> in fact, it is the same object for both... I just don't understand why it is dupplicated
4 [2017-01-08T18:31:01] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: finally got the invite from docker team to docker community
5 [2017-01-08T18:36:45] <galvesribeiro> lets see is someone from windows is alive there heheh
6 [2017-01-08T18:36:50] <galvesribeiro> slack chats usually are dead
7 [2017-01-08T18:36:51] <galvesribeiro> :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-08T19:59:24] <SISheogorath> I can't agree with that. Neither for the docker community nor for k8s, nor ghost
2 [2017-01-08T20:17:19] <galvesribeiro> humm

1 [2017-01-09T08:48:26] <matrixbot> Baffyis anyone having trouble starting docker on the latest Mint?
2 [2017-01-09T08:48:30] <matrixbot> Baffyi think it's a systemd issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T09:32:54] <avinash2888> is it possible to do Port forwarding from container to remote server ...if possible ,how can i do it ?
2 [2017-01-09T09:36:14] <avinash2888> hii@nischay30...i tried with dockerfile by putting the following commandssh   -f -Nusername@hostname-L [local port]:[database host]:[remote port] StrictHostKeyChecking=no
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T10:00:28] <nischay30> SISheogorath: hi that day  u had give me a link for docker-compose v3 file but in that they are using depends_on but in the release notes depends_on is not available
2 [2017-01-09T10:08:14] <nischay30> ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T11:08:02] <milanvdmria> Im trying to run a python script in a docker container but it is having import troubles. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-01-09T11:13:28] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: pwd runs fine, what do you exactly mean with checking if it is correct?
3 [2017-01-09T11:15:17] <SISheogorath> nischay30: try to not depend on order. If you do as mentioned in the linked document make your container waiting for the database. Because starting a database will take time anyways when you have some data in it anddepends_on, exempt the compose-file version 2.1,
4 [2017-01-09T11:15:34] <SISheogorath> Doesn't wait to start anyway
5 [2017-01-09T11:16:01] <SISheogorath> milanvdmria: that you're in the correct directory
6 [2017-01-09T11:16:23] <nischay30> SISheogorath: the container exits if the dependent container didn't start at time
7 [2017-01-09T11:17:26] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: I run it from the root in the docker container. That is also where thefolderis located. So from the root (pwdgives back /), I runpython folder/subfolder1/script1.py
8 [2017-01-09T11:17:44] <SISheogorath> nischay30: fix it ;)
9 [2017-01-09T11:18:40] <nischay30> SISheogorath: seriously i was not able to fix it..
10 [2017-01-09T11:20:07] <SISheogorath> milanvdmria: you may have to check the Python version. (I'm not a Python coder so I'm possibility wrong) but docs talk about version 3.2 in case of your way to build the software: [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-01-09T11:20:21] <SISheogorath> nischay30: what's the problem?
12 [2017-01-09T11:21:24] <SISheogorath> As mentioned in the docs you should use dockerize, wait-for-it.sh or a selfwritten solution
13 [2017-01-09T11:22:07] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: Locally I am running 2.7.12 and on the docker 2.7.13.Im gonna upgrade locally and check if the problem persists :)
14 [2017-01-09T11:24:40] <SISheogorath> milanvdmria: As mentioned it was just a guess based on that I found it the docs ^^ For me Python in its thousands and thousands of versions and different handlings of errors, exceptions and libs is nothing I want to use. So I can't really make good recommendations
15 [2017-01-09T11:27:26] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: The same problem persists. Locally it works, in the container it doesnt.
16 [2017-01-09T11:30:13] <SISheogorath> What does the import error exactly say?
17 [2017-01-09T11:54:20] <nischay30> ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T11:53:24] <Husamuddin> hello there!
2 [2017-01-09T11:53:38] <Husamuddin> hello there!
3 [2017-01-09T11:53:52] <Husamuddin> I have a question on the fly!
4 [2017-01-09T11:54:10] <Husamuddin> is anybody here?!
5 [2017-01-09T11:57:43] <Husamuddin> if run docker-compose up.. should I see the running containers of docker-compose on docker ps?!
6 [2017-01-09T11:57:55] <nischay30> yes
7 [2017-01-09T11:59:15] <Husamuddin> this is odd.. I run docker-compose ps and find a running services.. but can't find them on docker ps or docker-compose exec the running container
8 [2017-01-09T12:00:25] <nischay30> it wil show
9 [2017-01-09T12:01:49] <Husamuddin> supposedly yes.. but it doesn't
10 [2017-01-09T12:02:18] <Husamuddin> I'm searching around to find if there is anybody having the same issue but can't find any till now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T12:07:09] <SISheogorath> Husamuddin: do you usectrl+cbefore you rundocker ps?
2 [2017-01-09T12:07:20] <SISheogorath> In this case your containers are stopped
3 [2017-01-09T12:12:42] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath:  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-01-09T12:17:39] <SISheogorath> Are you on windows or linux?
5 [2017-01-09T12:18:13] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: mac, but this error is from the docker container which runs alpine3.5
6 [2017-01-09T12:19:19] <milanvdmria> Because when I run it on my mac, it runs just fine.
7 [2017-01-09T12:25:12] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: Ill try that, it is just weird that it runs locally where my Pythonpath is completely clean. It seems though that  it is more a Python problem than a Docker problem.
8 [2017-01-09T13:25:54] <milanvdmria> SISheogorath: I added/newfolder/folderto myPYTHONPATHin the dockerfile but it is still not working.(PYTHONPATH="/newfolder/folder:/newfolder/folder/subfolder1:/newfolder/folder/subfolder2")So now Im not convinced anymore it is a Python problem but more a Python problem related to Docker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T12:22:49] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] <-- sounds like a possible solution. I guess/is not part of the$PYTHONPATHfor multiple reasons. So first of all may place your code into a directory instead of blank/and than this directory to$PYTHONPATH
2 [2017-01-09T12:26:06] <SISheogorath> yes. iirc MacOS haspwdin$PATHwhich is also used to find modules
3 [2017-01-09T13:50:42] <SISheogorath> milanvdmria: as mentioned I'm not a python pro so maybe someone else can help you. You should possibly ask on freenode or open an issue on github related to your base image
4 [2017-01-09T13:51:16] <SISheogorath> richard-ball: what do you mean by "not seeing my host mounted volumes"?
5 [2017-01-09T14:51:02] <SISheogorath> are you sure it's not completely failing on permissions?
6 [2017-01-09T14:52:13] <SISheogorath> Because the mounted volume is owned by uid 500 and your container is using 123?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T13:17:12] <richard-ball> How do I ensure that docker sees my host mounted volumes?
2 [2017-01-09T13:17:49] <richard-ball> I am getting permission denied I have restarted docker and its still not seeing my host mounted volumes.
3 [2017-01-09T14:38:18] <richard-ball> I have mounted an EBS volume to my host, when i run docker it is trying to access the mountpoint and not the mounted volume. As such I get access denided
4 [2017-01-09T14:43:45] <richard-ball> `mount /dev/sdb /var/jenkins_homedocker run -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
5 [2017-01-09T14:44:17] <richard-ball> It does not write to the mounted volume, it tries to write to the host folder /var/jenkins_home and fails on permissions, why?
6 [2017-01-09T14:58:12] <richard-ball> ive entered the container and i see /var/jenkins_home is filling up
7 [2017-01-09T14:58:23] <richard-ball> even though i have passed -v /var/jenkins_home
8 [2017-01-09T14:58:39] <richard-ball> I thought that exposed the path to the host?
9 [2017-01-09T14:58:57] <richard-ball> if i do -v dir:dir it fails on permissions
10 [2017-01-09T14:59:12] <richard-ball> i tested with non moutned volumes on the host and it works
11 [2017-01-09T14:59:17] <richard-ball> its to do with the mounted volumes
12 [2017-01-09T14:59:41] <richard-ball> I would think this is standard practice since you would use separate ebs volume for peristent data to that of the OS.
13 [2017-01-09T15:00:43] <SISheogorath> richard-ball: no, that's only add a datavolume. Check: [<-LINK->]
14 [2017-01-09T15:01:12] <SISheogorath> you have to define host path and in-container path
15 [2017-01-09T15:01:27] <SISheogorath> than you mount the host's directory
16 [2017-01-09T15:03:42] <richard-ball> I did that
17 [2017-01-09T15:03:47] <richard-ball> drwxr-xr-x 3 jenkins jenkins 4096 Jan  9 10:55 /var/jenkins_home/
18 [2017-01-09T15:04:00] <richard-ball> docker run -d --name jenkins -v /var/jenkins_home:var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 jenkins
19 [2017-01-09T15:04:12] <richard-ball> Can not write to /var/jenkins_home/copy_reference_file.log. Wrong volume permissions?
20 [2017-01-09T15:05:01] <richard-ball> docker is not respecting the host mounted volumes
21 [2017-01-09T15:05:12] <richard-ball> /dev/xvdb       7.8G   18M  7.4G   1% /var/jenkins_home
22 [2017-01-09T15:05:54] <SISheogorath> can you rundocker exec -it jenkins whoami
23 [2017-01-09T15:07:08] <richard-ball> It fails to run because of the permission error
24 [2017-01-09T15:07:31] <SISheogorath> Oh I see
25 [2017-01-09T15:07:55] <richard-ball> I reran without the volume moutned and it says jenkins
26 [2017-01-09T15:08:23] <richard-ball> Docker version 1.11.2, build b9f10c9/1.11.2
27 [2017-01-09T15:08:27] <richard-ball> im using AWS AMI
28 [2017-01-09T15:08:29] <SISheogorath> than you should check the permissions and UIDs of your volume
29 [2017-01-09T15:09:06] <SISheogorath> because, as mentioned before, the in-container UID does not match with the UID on your host which has write permissions to the volume and THAT is your problem
30 [2017-01-09T15:11:09] <richard-ball> what UID?
31 [2017-01-09T15:11:27] <SISheogorath> you know unix uids?
32 [2017-01-09T15:11:34] <richard-ball> ahh
33 [2017-01-09T15:12:22] <SISheogorath> you container doesn't run as root so it has to follow the rules like every other user and respect the file permissions on the volume
34 [2017-01-09T15:13:29] <richard-ball> I set -u jenkins
35 [2017-01-09T15:13:38] <richard-ball> -u uid worked
36 [2017-01-09T15:13:40] <richard-ball> thanks a lot.
37 [2017-01-09T15:14:14] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
38 [2017-01-09T15:14:17] <richard-ball> I thought by specifying -u jenkins it would map it
39 [2017-01-09T15:15:22] <richard-ball> I guess that is inside the container.
40 [2017-01-09T15:30:53] <SISheogorath> yes it sets the UID inside the container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T14:52:57] <j6k4m8> SISheogorath: interesting! Does that mean docker would fail to mount, or just fail to write?
2 [2017-01-09T14:53:15] <j6k4m8> I would have imagined it failed at write-time, since the mount is legal but the write isn’t
3 [2017-01-09T14:53:16] <SISheogorath> easiest way to verify:docker run -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home alpine touch /var/jenkins_home/test.txt
4 [2017-01-09T14:53:42] <SISheogorath> right@j6k4m8that's what I'm thinking
5 [2017-01-09T14:53:50] <j6k4m8> gotcha
6 [2017-01-09T14:54:58] <SISheogorath> To make containers more secure theUSERTag is used more often in Dockerfiles. This way you drop root permissions which results in a problem if you mount directories from your real host. Because you have an uid mismatch
7 [2017-01-09T14:56:15] <j6k4m8> just gave this a test on my machine, failed onwrite, not mount. Learned something new :)
8 [2017-01-09T14:56:29] <j6k4m8> (Though it was just a regular directory that I mounted, nothing special)
9 [2017-01-09T14:56:56] <j6k4m8> Is that what you expected?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T16:17:25] <Husamuddin> hello! do any body knows why command property in the docker-compose.yml file prevents docker to make the container up! [<-CODE->] I mean you won't find it on docker ps
2 [2017-01-09T16:19:00] <Husamuddin> I just need to run bash script just after the container is up.. without override the default command
3 [2017-01-09T16:48:53] <Husamuddin> I still don't get why it prevents container to be up!
4 [2017-01-09T16:49:07] <Husamuddin> I can't see it in docker ps
5 [2017-01-09T16:53:26] <Husamuddin> I don't get that why i feel like it's complicated.. I'm doing volume .:/app and once it's up I need to run specific bash script from that dir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T16:35:27] <killerspaz> Husamuddin: see if this helps: [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-01-09T16:35:56] <killerspaz> my guess is you have an entrypoint defined
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T17:56:00] <SISheogorath> Husamuddin: as@killerspazmentioned there is maybe an entrypoint script. If there is an entrypoint script your command is passed to the entrypoint script like parameters. So you may want to check that
2 [2017-01-09T17:57:11] <SISheogorath> (by reading your Dockerfile)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T19:24:49] <somombo> jeffdm: I see you are listed on the docker/toolbox list of core maintainer.. and I didn't really know how else to reach out. I opened a PR ( [<-ISSUE->] ) for which there's also an open issue several months ago. I was wondering if you or anyone else would be able to review it or discuss changes that need to be made. It doesn't appear that there has been any feedback from the docker/toolbox maintainers.. I really appreciate it!
2 [2017-01-09T20:57:42] <somombo> Lol..@killerspaz, of course this is in fact, an issue . Here is a screenshot of  a trying to rundocker infoon a clean Windows 10 install of the latest Docker Toolbox  in three different terminal environments. It fails in all but the "Docker Quickstart terminal" Why?. There is an open discussion going on here ( [<-ISSUE->] ). Feel free to read through the details and ask questions on that thread ... we would love to here your feedback.
3 [2017-01-09T20:58:03] <somombo> The PR [<-ISSUE->] fixes this but it doesn't seem to have been reviewed yet by the team
4 [2017-01-09T21:06:07] <somombo> here you go@killerspaz [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-09T21:06:32] <somombo> you will be able to zoom in if you follow the link
6 [2017-01-09T21:07:38] <somombo> as you can see on the left dockerwasrunning
7 [2017-01-09T21:09:44] <somombo> I know exactly what yourdocker-machine ... evalcommand is doing the problem is you have to re-run that commandeverytimeyou close out of your terminal.. that's not how docker was meant to be.. and the PR fixes that
8 [2017-01-09T21:11:16] <somombo> evalportion sets the environment variables for that session... transiently .. once session is done you have to run that command again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T19:26:50] <killerspaz> how is that an issue? You can access docker from anywhere, you just have to actually START boot2linux
2 [2017-01-09T21:03:30] <killerspaz> I told you, it's failing because you aren't actually starting boot2linux like the Docker Quickstart Terminal does... all it is, is a simple shell script initializing docker.... i don't use it and have never had any issues getting to docker
3 [2017-01-09T21:04:02] <killerspaz> docker-machine start default && eval $(docker-machine env).... then i'm set
4 [2017-01-09T21:04:24] <killerspaz> and I can't see your screenshot, it's too small on my screen and no way to expand it?
5 [2017-01-09T21:05:01] <killerspaz> somombo: try that combo-command and i'm 99.999999% certain you'll be accessing Docker within seconds
6 [2017-01-09T21:05:48] <killerspaz> the error isn't saying it can't find the docker binary, which that PR seems to focus on.. it's saying it can't connect to a pipe
7 [2017-01-09T21:07:15] <killerspaz> yeah that's the error when docker host isn't running
8 [2017-01-09T21:08:30] <killerspaz> try the command... guarantee it'll start working
9 [2017-01-09T21:08:47] <killerspaz> reviewC:\\Program Files\\Docker Toolbox\\start.sh; you'll see it does very little with a ton of error checking
10 [2017-01-09T21:08:57] <killerspaz> that's whatDocker Quickstart Terminalexecutes
11 [2017-01-09T21:09:27] <killerspaz> in the end, it does exactly what i said to run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T21:07:52] <erichermansson> Is it possible to have bridged network using docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T21:11:24] <killerspaz> Mmmmm I\'m not sure I agree with the "not how docker was meant to be".... I WANT it to lose my env vars every time I restart my terminal, so I\'m not working on the wrong machine
2 [2017-01-09T21:12:20] <killerspaz> the whole concept of docker in general is transient/ephemeral run-time.... to me this is right inline with that mentality.
3 [2017-01-09T21:14:33] <galvesribeiro> never used docker toolbox or machine...
4 [2017-01-09T21:14:51] <galvesribeiro> dunno if it is required nowadays with official Docker Inc. support of docker on windows
5 [2017-01-09T21:15:24] <killerspaz> can you run linux guests with your setup@galvesribeiro?
6 [2017-01-09T21:15:32] <galvesribeiro> yup
7 [2017-01-09T21:15:43] <galvesribeiro> Docker for Windows create a vm of MobyLinux on HyperV
8 [2017-01-09T21:15:48] <galvesribeiro> and you can run linux containers there
9 [2017-01-09T21:16:09] <somombo> official docker for windows requires hyper-V which breaks your ability to use Virtualbox on the same machine for other things e.g. android dev
10 [2017-01-09T21:16:10] <galvesribeiro> you just need to switch the client to point to the proper ddaemon
11 [2017-01-09T21:16:33] <galvesribeiro> it is not a requirement actually
12 [2017-01-09T21:16:39] <galvesribeiro> you can live without it
13 [2017-01-09T21:16:46] <killerspaz> doesn't hyperv require windows server?
14 [2017-01-09T21:16:56] <galvesribeiro> you just wont be able to start linux containers
15 [2017-01-09T21:17:08] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: you have it on windows "clients" as well
16 [2017-01-09T21:17:12] <galvesribeiro> and windows containers as well
17 [2017-01-09T21:17:25] <galvesribeiro> somombo: btw, I use hyperV for Android simulator as well
18 [2017-01-09T21:17:53] <galvesribeiro> A LOT faster than VMs from google or the 3rd party ones based on virtual box
19 [2017-01-09T21:18:21] <somombo> cool.. I much rather not be locked in.. use different tools for different jobs
20 [2017-01-09T21:18:39] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
21 [2017-01-09T21:18:54] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: that make the docker client to connect to the VM
22 [2017-01-09T21:19:01] <galvesribeiro> but you are not obligated to have it
23 [2017-01-09T21:19:50] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
24 [2017-01-09T21:19:54] <galvesribeiro> and like I said, containers and hyper-v are 2 diff things
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T21:21:20] <killerspaz> i can't remember what i did, but i've only ever seen that menu on first install... i've completely uninstalled and killed every registry key I could find, but still doesn't come back on re-install for me.... but honestly, it's working exactly like I expect it to and directly compatible with our linux workflow, so I'm ok with how it is atm
2 [2017-01-09T21:22:28] <killerspaz> yeah i'm running win10 home, those don't exist for me :/
3 [2017-01-09T21:22:34] <galvesribeiro> oh yeah
4 [2017-01-09T21:22:37] <galvesribeiro> forgot to mention
5 [2017-01-09T21:22:40] <killerspaz> server only
6 [2017-01-09T21:22:43] <galvesribeiro> windows 10 pro or enterprise
7 [2017-01-09T21:22:45] <galvesribeiro> no
8 [2017-01-09T21:23:02] <galvesribeiro> windows 10 works, home SKU isn't supposed to run work/professional stuff :P
9 [2017-01-09T21:24:03] <killerspaz> interesting... they have an article on msdn on 5/6/2016 that saysWindows 10 Enterprise, Professional, or Education, but another on 7/2/2016 saying it will only work on win8 and server 2012+ .... lame...
10 [2017-01-09T21:24:17] <killerspaz> anyway, i find it funny that Education somehow has more support than Home :P
11 [2017-01-09T21:24:54] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T21:24:19] <somombo> anyhow@killerspazi'm not here to debate toolbox, this is not the right place for this.. Just thought I'd shout out to anybody that's helping maintain the toolbox repo to give the Issue and PR a serious and honest look. I am not the only one who thinks there is something wrong docker-toolbox workflow. So if the outcome of giving it an honest look and discussing how to move forward is a decision that that PR is not the best way to do it and a better way is provided.. then that's great! I'm all for that. We invite you to engage on github.
2 [2017-01-09T21:24:59] <somombo> jeffdm:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T22:51:32] <NickStefan> docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up, i used to be able to pair these and it would only rebuild images when things needed to be. my containers are now being rebuilt from scratch every time. any reason one could think?
2 [2017-01-09T22:53:35] <NickStefan>  [<-CODE->] used to be, that if i hadnt changed requirements.txt, it would reuse that cache. i have not changed requirements.txt and for some reason its bailing and not using the cache
3 [2017-01-09T22:55:47] <NickStefan> its rebuilding containers that i have definitely not changed. for example, im changing stuff in a django container, but theres a node container i never touch, and its going through all the npm install bs that usually only happens when the package.json is different (invalidates the build)
4 [2017-01-09T22:57:42] <NickStefan>  [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-01-09T22:58:19] <NickStefan> usr/src is being mounted as a volume
6 [2017-01-09T22:58:51] <NickStefan> could it be a log file or something being written from inside that docker?
7 [2017-01-09T22:59:06] <killerspaz> my guess is it's another container or directly from your host
8 [2017-01-09T22:59:24] <killerspaz> try building that one image alone a few minutes apart, see if it ever does a cache-bust
9 [2017-01-09T22:59:35] <killerspaz> if so, it's def your host.... if not, then it has to be another image
10 [2017-01-09T23:00:43] <killerspaz> either way, I think the result is the fact your/usr/srcis being modified before yourWORKDIR /usr/srcis re-executed, and thus invalidates the layer cache
11 [2017-01-09T23:00:55] <NickStefan> thats helpful, thanks
12 [2017-01-09T23:02:27] <killerspaz> honestly it's a wild guess :P
13 [2017-01-09T23:09:17] <NickStefan> so, ive killed everything. and im just doingdocker-compose build django(single container)
14 [2017-01-09T23:09:39] <NickStefan> it builds. finishes. dont touch ANY CODE, and rundocker-compose build djangoagain, and it once again invalidates and rebuilds all
15 [2017-01-09T23:09:46] <NickStefan> must be OS ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T22:54:28] <killerspaz> is your source is changing between builds? or are you clearing any dangling containers at any point?
2 [2017-01-09T22:56:21] <killerspaz> looks like cache is actually breaking at step 3; which is very strange
3 [2017-01-09T22:56:36] <killerspaz> is something else changing the contents of/usr/srcfrom a shared volume?
4 [2017-01-09T22:57:08] <killerspaz> sub-question, are you volume mounting/usr/srcfrom your host?
5 [2017-01-09T22:58:39] <killerspaz> I bet something external is changing it and docker isn't liking that one bit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-09T23:18:58] <NickStefan> even justdocker build .in the directory repeatedly builds the entire thing. i have nothing else running. not changing any code. any ideas where to look?
2 [2017-01-09T23:22:46] <NickStefan> how can I debug that WORKDIR /usr/src keeps making a different checksum?
3 [2017-01-10T00:00:05] <NickStefan> so another dev, same code, not having this problem... so my computer i guess
4 [2017-01-10T00:23:35] <NickStefan> SOMEONE_IMPORTANT: (lol), the problem was that i was on 1.13.0-rc beta. Rolling back to 1.12.5 stable fixed everything!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-10T14:53:37] <j6k4m8> super tempted to change my nick to@SOMEONE_IMPORTANT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-10T14:56:17] <erichermansson> Anyone know how i run docker with bridged network?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-10T21:48:59] <holmser> I've got an interesting issue... I'm running docker containers and the application is reporting significant time skew
2 [2017-01-10T21:49:32] <holmser> but when I check on both the host and the container using date and hwclock they are both identical and correct
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T04:12:39] <quickeee> Hi , is there any documentation or checklist before moving application into production running in docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T07:06:39] <kschlesselmann> quickeee: Well there are recommendations for production docker daemon setups … regarding to your application: propably the same you had before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T10:52:19] <decabyte> Hi all, I've got a question about production environments and upgrades of the docker-engine. I've been managing my docker-compose services using Systemd units however upon upgrade of the docker engine the system doesn't restart the containers. Is there any best practice to follow during the upgrade path?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T14:30:36] <dragon788> How are you typically starting the containers in the first place? Have you added them to a systemd startup script or you just assume your system will never reboot?
2 [2017-01-11T14:30:49] <dragon788> decabyte: ^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T15:42:34] <xiaopeng163> welcome to use this lab [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T17:29:37] <SISheogorath> quickeee: A very useful test: Start your application, write things that should persist, than stop the contaienr, remove it. start a new one an check that your stateful data is still there. There is nothing more annoying than to realize that you mounted your volume to the wrong path ;) after 2 days of use (in my case it was  while staging but have this in a production setup is horror)

1 [2017-01-11T17:36:26] <galvesribeiro> guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T17:37:50] <galvesribeiro> does docker swarm detect network partition?
2 [2017-01-11T17:38:23] <galvesribeiro> I mean, it is based on Raft, so if 1 node fail to ping, the other nodes will tell that it is dead... ok, that work for the managers but, what about the other nodes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T20:23:35] <Aetherix> Hi, I've just created my first Docker image. I've pushed it to Docker Hub. I can pull it from another machine, but I can't see it on the Docker Hub web page. Any ideas?
2 [2017-01-11T20:28:17] <Aetherix> That would explain it. I'll just keep an eye on it then.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T20:27:08] <killerspaz> Might be a batched process, could take a bit?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T20:31:16] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: any ideas about my previous question?
2 [2017-01-11T20:33:51] <killerspaz> I didn't quite understand it
3 [2017-01-11T20:34:31] <killerspaz> Other nodes should be connecting via host/service name, so the managers should work it out (if I'm understanding correctly)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T20:34:58] <milanvdmria> I made a docker container with Airflow (which runs on localhost:8080) and I exposed that port. But how can I connect to the localhost inside of the docker and get the 'site' on my chrome?
2 [2017-01-11T20:36:15] <Aetherix> Did you trydocker run -d -p 8080:8080 <your image>
3 [2017-01-11T20:38:01] <Aetherix> 8080:8080as in<your chrome port:your docker port>
4 [2017-01-11T20:38:58] <milanvdmria> Oke, thanks, I couldnt directly find it in the docs.Seems I have some permission error though.docker: Error response from daemon: invalid header field value "oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused \\"exec: \\\\\\"/entrypoint.sh\\\\\\": permission denied\\"\\n".
5 [2017-01-11T20:40:22] <milanvdmria> Forgot mychown, nvm :)
6 [2017-01-11T20:40:52] <Aetherix> Nice! Glad that it works!
7 [2017-01-11T20:44:46] <killerspaz> milanvdmria: check out: [<-LINK->]
8 [2017-01-11T21:02:39] <milanvdmria> When I do the connect to the exposed port in docker, that is the moment where the entrypoint.sh gets executed right?
9 [2017-01-11T21:02:58] <milanvdmria> Because I added some echo's in the entrypoint.sh but dont see them printed.
10 [2017-01-11T21:05:22] <milanvdmria> Oke, I see them when I start bash with the run command.
11 [2017-01-11T21:09:32] <killerspaz> no, entrypoint is executed the instant the container is ran
12 [2017-01-11T21:11:46] <killerspaz> I have a question: I have a container mounting a volume and writing to the FS, but gives permission denied... My thought it is has to do with UnionFS? Basically a user is created inside the dockerfile and switched to that user, but on my host that user ID (1000) has limited ACL.... What's the proper solution for this? We don't control the Dockerfile, so chown/chmod in there isn't valid, right now I'm resorting to doing a chown on the host through the volume mount, but I don't like seeing on the host that the owner of the volume is a hardened user.
13 [2017-01-11T21:16:37] <killerspaz> What is the best practice for this type of ping-pong of user IDs?
14 [2017-01-11T21:21:24] <killerspaz> no no... i'm mounting the volume, it's owned by my host's logged-in user because .. well.. i made it... but when the container wants to write to it, the UID of the user inside the container is a different UID than my own
15 [2017-01-11T21:23:18] <dragon788> yeah, typically there is a trick you can perform in the Dockerfile to map the runtime user to your host\'s UID so that the permissions don\'t get mucked up, but if you aren\'t doing an "FROM: Someimage" with your own chown/chmod commands that doesn\'t help much
16 [2017-01-11T21:23:54] <killerspaz> so say my host user is "spaz", uid = 1005... inside the container it creates a user, uid = 1000.... when it wants to write, the volume is owned by 1005 and fails... permission denied.chown 1000.1000 /path/to/volumefixes the issue
17 [2017-01-11T21:24:28] <killerspaz> ok, i was afriad of that.... I'll just document it for now, but that kinda blows :/
18 [2017-01-11T22:22:34] <killerspaz> if the first argument to the script is any of those strings, then do something
19 [2017-01-11T22:23:18] <killerspaz> so:entrypoint.sh webserverwould trigger the code following that
20 [2017-01-11T22:23:33] <killerspaz> np
21 [2017-01-11T22:23:48] <killerspaz> that's standard bash scripting stuff if you need to google more about it
22 [2017-01-11T22:24:26] <milanvdmria> Yea, its late here, I completely forgot it was bash so I was googling for docker stuff instead
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T21:18:29] <dragon788> you can mount a volume as a specific user/UID I believe, but if you don't have control of the Dockerfile it becomes a bit more challenging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-11T22:20:22] <milanvdmria> In an entryfile, what exactly doesif [ "$1" = "webserver" ] || [ "$1" = "worker" ] || [ "$1" = "scheduler" ] ; thenmean?
2 [2017-01-11T22:20:36] <milanvdmria> I assume it tests if a certain image is there or something?
3 [2017-01-11T22:23:25] <milanvdmria> Oke
4 [2017-01-11T22:23:30] <milanvdmria> Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-12T00:42:03] <mingsterism> does anyone know what does this code mean?
2 [2017-01-12T00:42:16] <mingsterism>  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-12T00:47:10] <killerspaz> if the user isn't in the docker group add vagrant to the docker group and restart your shell and runlaunch.shin the process
2 [2017-01-12T00:47:41] <killerspaz> this is so vagrant can run docker commands without root access
3 [2017-01-12T00:47:45] <killerspaz> (or sudo)
4 [2017-01-12T00:48:40] <mingsterism> thanks. whatsnewgrp docker
5 [2017-01-12T00:48:45] <mingsterism> create a new group?

7 [2017-01-12T00:49:15] <killerspaz> no that will reset the shell
8 [2017-01-12T00:49:22] <killerspaz> man newgrpin your shell
9 [2017-01-12T00:50:47] <mingsterism> in the code block above, can i change the name to something else apart fromvagrant
10 [2017-01-12T00:50:55] <mingsterism> because i dont intend to installvagrant.
11 [2017-01-12T00:51:20] <killerspaz> well, that code would be useful in something like an environment setup script, not something you'd need to execute regularly
12 [2017-01-12T00:51:24] <mingsterism> this is the original bash script. i dont seevagrantappear anywhere except for that line
13 [2017-01-12T00:51:27] <mingsterism>  [<-LINK->]
14 [2017-01-12T00:51:53] <mingsterism> it looks likevagrantis just a name to me? dont know if right
15 [2017-01-12T00:52:06] <killerspaz> The readme saysThe network playground is a Vagrant box...
16 [2017-01-12T00:52:19] <killerspaz> meaning you're expected to operate within the confines given
17 [2017-01-12T00:52:21] <mingsterism> yes. its a vagrant box just to load up theos
18 [2017-01-12T00:52:31] <mingsterism> but i think all the work is done in docker right?
19 [2017-01-12T00:52:34] <killerspaz> yeah so that script is the launching point of the playground
20 [2017-01-12T00:52:37] <mingsterism> cos i intend to use digitalocean
21 [2017-01-12T00:53:08] <killerspaz> the dev is likely using vagrant to orchestrate docker composition
22 [2017-01-12T00:53:09] <mingsterism> i mean to load up the network, he isnt using vagrant. just purely docker right?
23 [2017-01-12T00:53:18] <killerspaz> i'm not a vagrant user so i'm uncertain of most of it
24 [2017-01-12T00:53:29] <mingsterism> oh. do you know how to find it. because vagrant is causing me many headaches
25 [2017-01-12T00:53:40] <mingsterism> if i can just purely use docker ordocker-machinethat would be awesome
26 [2017-01-12T00:54:24] <killerspaz> it could be that something else is executing vagrant, i'm uncertain.... don't really plan on reading the source of a project i don't use
27 [2017-01-12T00:55:17] <mingsterism> totally understand. but actually its just a few files there. if u see the code.

29 [2017-01-12T00:55:36] <killerspaz> there's also this: [<-LINK->]
30 [2017-01-12T00:55:37] <mingsterism> i went through  them. it didnt seem like it was using vagrant. but just wasnt too sure.
31 [2017-01-12T00:56:49] <mingsterism> thanks  :)
32 [2017-01-12T00:56:52] <mingsterism> didnt see that earlier
33 [2017-01-12T01:08:06] <mingsterism> how can i create this purely in docker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-12T02:16:24] <dragon788> You may be able to do it with docker-compose but it might require Adobe extra networking commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-12T11:43:02] <milanvdmria> Currently I have build three images: alpine with postgres, pyspark, and airflow.I would like to connect those three (and execute their entrypoints.sh). But honestly, Im quite confused on how to tackle this problem.

17 [2017-01-13T13:07:37] <jacobus-brogly> CentOS is a major distro, you can have this error  flying under the radar

1 [2017-01-13T10:46:04] <graingert> anyone know what the timeline for docker-py 2 is ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T12:31:09] <dragon788> That isn't all Docker's fault, if CentOS has that installed from another package or repository it would fail no matter what Docker does

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T14:36:06] <SISheogorath> jeud: you can restart them. check out their logs etc. you don't need to usedocker runto start a container.docker runis just a shortcurt fordocker create && docker start

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T15:41:29] <killerspaz> jacobus-brogly: you do realize that error you keep getting is due to your ignorance of how a package manager works, right?
2 [2017-01-13T15:42:45] <killerspaz> has nothing to do with Docker, has to do with how your system already has a docker daemon installed.
3 [2017-01-13T15:43:30] <killerspaz> jeud: check this or something similar out: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-01-13T15:43:47] <killerspaz> i haven\'t found one that\'s "perfect," but it should give you most of the important info
5 [2017-01-13T15:44:56] <killerspaz> Anyone familiar with this change? I swear I never had that env var.... but now i'm curious why ANY value works?  [<-LINK->]

7 [2017-01-13T17:16:52] <killerspaz> sbbowers__twitter: we opted to use firewalled private registries to avoid having to worry about auth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T17:15:45] <dragon788> sbbowers__twitter: I\'d use a runtime volume mount or an environment variable passed in with an API key or equivalent, not sure what the "best practice" is
2 [2017-01-13T17:19:19] <dragon788> killerspaz: how did you install Compose on Windows that you got that env-var?
3 [2017-01-13T17:20:57] <killerspaz> it came packaged with Docker Toolbox
4 [2017-01-13T17:21:18] <killerspaz> Toolbox 1.12.6
5 [2017-01-13T17:23:42] <killerspaz> damnit, nowdocker-compose downis throwing python errors :/

7 [2017-01-13T17:25:04] <killerspaz> strange that I'm seeing this on a stable build....
8 [2017-01-13T17:25:27] <killerspaz> apparently means docker daemon can't be reached, but it USED to say explicitly it couldn't....
9 [2017-01-13T17:40:52] <killerspaz> i mean usually you have to copy a key, or embed the creds, or do some env vars... all of which end up storing some form of credentials (i.e.,git remote/.gitconfigwill show user/pass ifhttpsprotocol)....
10 [2017-01-13T17:41:18] <killerspaz> you can create read-only deploy users to alleviate any damage, but your IP is still at stake
11 [2017-01-13T17:41:29] <killerspaz> IP being intellectual property, not internet protocol addy
12 [2017-01-13T17:43:45] <SISheogorath> mhm passing credentials as build-arg -> bad idea
13 [2017-01-13T17:45:03] <SISheogorath> all this secret management is still bad in docker :/ it's sad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T17:34:04] <SISheogorath> jeud: You can also use a build-arg or download your keys from some trusted source and remove it in the same run step. The build arg is the pretty way but I'm not sure how it is placed inside the image so maybe it's secret, maybe not.

4 [2017-01-13T19:18:51] <killerspaz> why have 2 urls?! both pointing to the registry?

6 [2017-01-13T19:42:10] <killerspaz> bleeding edge version of what, that is
7 [2017-01-13T19:43:31] <killerspaz> hmm... looks like you have to enable auth if you want to access the registry with TLS... LAME
8 [2017-01-13T19:44:09] <killerspaz> i have TLS to enable exposure of theregistry, but auth disabled since it's behind a firewall... butdocker-registry-webassumes the only way to enable TLS is to also enable auth :/

15 [2017-01-13T20:56:02] <killerspaz> it's not the prettiest, but it gets the job done for now... i just want my devs to know what images are available to them

17 [2017-01-13T21:22:50] <killerspaz> i can't use bash for windows until you can write to the linux fs from within windows
18 [2017-01-13T21:23:00] <killerspaz> too painful otherwise
19 [2017-01-13T21:54:10] <killerspaz> if you write to it from windows it won't be accessible from LFW/UFW/whatevertf you wanna call it these days
20 [2017-01-13T21:54:32] <galvesribeiro> yes it
21 [2017-01-13T21:54:35] <killerspaz> they finally fixed the inotify issues about a month ago, though.. so that's nice
22 [2017-01-13T21:54:37] <galvesribeiro> there is a mount point
23 [2017-01-13T21:54:49] <killerspaz> no, that's from linux subspace
24 [2017-01-13T21:54:51] <killerspaz> not windows
25 [2017-01-13T21:55:07] <killerspaz> i can't open file explorer and place a file into the linux filesystem's home directory and see it in bash
26 [2017-01-13T21:55:26] <killerspaz> i can from bash write to the mount into linux though, yes
27 [2017-01-13T21:55:45] <galvesribeiro> you can put it on the C:\\something that will be available on /mnt/c/something
28 [2017-01-13T21:55:58] <killerspaz> that's not what i'm referencing
29 [2017-01-13T21:56:13] <galvesribeiro> you mean write directly to the linux partition... I got it
30 [2017-01-13T21:56:29] <galvesribeiro> I just don't know why you want to do that if the mount point works
31 [2017-01-13T21:56:34] <galvesribeiro> I use it all day
32 [2017-01-13T21:56:43] <killerspaz> i just said... i want to, FROM WINDOWS, WRITE TO LINUX
33 [2017-01-13T21:57:09] <galvesribeiro> yes, but I don't see why you need that :D
34 [2017-01-13T21:57:34] <galvesribeiro> you can write on the windows FS and use the file on linux thru the mount point
35 [2017-01-13T21:57:47] <galvesribeiro> I have linux C++ code in a windows directory
36 [2017-01-13T21:58:00] <galvesribeiro> which I build on linux but edit the files on windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T19:36:03] <dragon788> are you using a bleeding edge version that supports the new trusted binaries facilities?

4 [2017-01-13T21:21:31] <galvesribeiro> that happen while updating Bash for Windows here... I wonder if they are eventually giving up that docker VM on windows (for linux containers) and use bash for windows...
5 [2017-01-13T21:31:46] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz: what you mean? bash for windows has a linux fs...

1 [2017-01-13T21:23:34] <patrickleet> Hey - I'm trying to figure out how depends_on and healthcheck work in docker-compose 1.10https://github.com/docker/compose/releasesI see it vaguely documented but can't find any examples of how to use it. It says refer to the docs but I can't find docs for 1.10.Can anyone point me in the right direction?I want to use depends_on but wait for the service that I depend on to report as healthly before starting the next service.
2 [2017-01-13T21:25:30] <patrickleet> I've tried just adding a healthcheck to the dockerfile of the first image, and can verify it is working independently, however, depends_on does not wait for the healthcheck to be valid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-13T21:58:39] <killerspaz> it's not integrated enough for daily use imo.... if you wanna jump through hoops be my guest.. i have more important shit to do
2 [2017-01-13T21:59:01] <killerspaz> but write anything to %localappdata%\\Lxss\\rootfs and you'll never see it in bash
3 [2017-01-13T21:59:15] <galvesribeiro> yes, you are right, not the ideal
4 [2017-01-13T21:59:19] <galvesribeiro> but works for me
5 [2017-01-13T21:59:29] <galvesribeiro> I even call the build from windows
6 [2017-01-13T21:59:49] <galvesribeiro> bash -c /mnt/c/somepath/myscript.sh
7 [2017-01-13T21:59:55] <killerspaz> they have it Linux->Windows just great, now they just need the other way around and i'll be all ove rit
8 [2017-01-13T22:00:12] <killerspaz> can finally get off this horrible git bash
9 [2017-01-13T22:00:32] <galvesribeiro> yeah they will eventually get there
10 [2017-01-13T22:00:42] <galvesribeiro> the point is, the idea of bashfor windows is to be a tool
11 [2017-01-13T22:00:47] <galvesribeiro> not a complete OS inside windows
12 [2017-01-13T22:05:50] <galvesribeiro> anyway, was just a though... in all cases, docker for windows on windows 10, is just a dev tool. Its ok to have a VM hosting linux containers... in production, run in a real Linux, and windows containers on windows... docker is good enough to have a heterogeneous environment
13 [2017-01-13T22:36:18] <galvesribeiro> killerspaz:

16 [2017-01-13T22:39:26] <galvesribeiro> the client already works fine... only the dockerd which obviously require changes at kernel level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-14T03:46:45] <dragon788> with PowerShell for Linux you could probably add the Windows Filesystem as another "PSProvider" for cross system access
2 [2017-01-14T03:53:32] <galvesribeiro> dragon788: good idea
3 [2017-01-14T03:54:18] <galvesribeiro> although PS on linux is very unstable yet... and last time I tried on bash for windows it blow up the stdin/out
4 [2017-01-14T03:55:41] <dragon788> yeah, I think they are also working on the stdin/stdout in conjunction with the OpenSSH native binary for Windows
5 [2017-01-14T03:56:02] <galvesribeiro> yeah, that is a big win
6 [2017-01-14T03:56:46] <galvesribeiro> there are multiple libraries that work well today and allow SSH on powershell on windows
7 [2017-01-14T03:58:58] <dragon788> yeah, the native one that the OpenSSH for Windows team is working on is apparently hoping to go back upstream as well
8 [2017-01-14T04:00:45] <galvesribeiro> great

1 [2017-01-14T05:22:22] <ketchupmonkey> Did anyone have any issues running centos in docker? especially when restart services I keep on getting an error.

2 [2017-01-14T10:07:57] <SISheogorath> sounds not really nice :D first idea -> reboot
3 [2017-01-14T10:16:18] <SISheogorath> what exactly are you talking about?
4 [2017-01-14T18:20:06] <dragon788> ketchupmonkey:
5 [2017-01-14T18:20:14] <dragon788> typically you don't restart services, you restart containers
6 [2017-01-14T18:20:47] <dragon788> if you are trying to run a complex multi-service application you need to use something liketinito manage the initialization, because "init" isn\'t running in most containers
7 [2017-01-14T18:21:04] <dragon788> containers != VMs, so don't try to run a full OS in them

2 [2017-01-14T09:19:36] <Bajix> So this is a thing… any ideas?
3 [2017-01-14T10:08:38] <Bajix> Yea… I just made a new instance, reconfigured my load balancers, and cloudfront instead
4 [2017-01-14T10:09:04] <Bajix> I think it’s for automating things ;o
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-14T20:18:00] <ketchupmonkey> dragon788: oh the reason why i ask is because when i am just troubleshooting an apache service that is serving up my JS app when I use docker exec to see why the node died I was shocked with the error message when I just restarted the service, which I never faced that issue when I am using let's say an ubuntu image
2 [2017-01-14T20:35:58] <ketchupmonkey> i was using the latest ubuntu base image so i believe it should be systemd
3 [2017-01-14T20:36:48] <ketchupmonkey> I just found it weird why the ubuntu container image would allow me to restart an apache service while a centos:latest won't let me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-14T20:25:55] <dragon788> were you using systemd in your Ubuntu image as well or was it using Upstart or something else?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-14T20:46:13] <SISheogorath> ketchupmonkey: containers are more like a big single binary you're running on your server than a VM. (If we speak about how to handle it) so yeah don't try to do things like writing systemd.service files in containers. it's waste of time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-15T06:51:51] <sabrehagen> Is it true to say that theswarmimage on docker hub ( [<-LINK->] ) is the old docker swarm, and not 'swarm mode'?
2 [2017-01-15T13:11:34] <galvesribeiro> sabrehagen: te
3 [2017-01-15T13:11:42] <galvesribeiro> Yes
4 [2017-01-16T03:32:44] <sabrehagen> galvesribeiro: thanks
5 [2017-01-16T03:33:06] <sabrehagen> I keep gettingError response from daemon: Timeout was reached before node was joined. The attempt to join the swarm will continue in the background. Use the "docker info" command to see the current swarm status of your node.when I try and join nodes to my swarm. What could be making them take so long to join?
6 [2017-01-16T03:34:41] <galvesribeiro> I was never able to get swarm to work
7 [2017-01-16T03:34:53] <galvesribeiro> The swarm init just stuck and dont do anything
8 [2017-01-16T03:37:41] <sabrehagen> damn
9 [2017-01-16T04:42:19] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: thanks for running the experiment. disappointing that mine doesn't work. i deleted all my virtual machines and started a fresh. my current issue is that my workers are not listed in my swarm, however they appear to be added. your workers seem to be listed successfully (yourswarm-2machine). Here's my state: [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-01-16T05:09:12] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: Yep, definitely correct. --listen-addr is used when there are multiple networks on the host and it doesn\'t know which one to listen on. I\'ve avoided this by running the command directly within the machine. This gist shows the current state of my system. Worker 1 has attempted to join, leave, then rejoin and it\'s swarm state gets the error "context cancelled". Worker 2 never attempted to leave and it\'s still in a pending state: [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-01-16T05:18:00] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: thanks for the help nonetheless :) where can i get 1.13.0-rc7?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-16T03:39:57] <kinghuang> Do you have all the required ports open and accessible between your nodes?
2 [2017-01-16T03:40:36] <kinghuang> I have multiple swarms running. Once I got all the ports and stuff set up, they connected without problems.
3 [2017-01-16T03:42:05] <kinghuang> See [<-LINK->] for the list of ports. Note that 4789 and 7946 are both tcp and udp.
4 [2017-01-16T03:45:35] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: this is the state i'm in, and not sure how to get out of it: [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-16T03:47:31] <galvesribeiro> kinghuang: I meant docker for windows on windows 10
6 [2017-01-16T03:47:50] <kinghuang> Hmm, I'm not very familiar with using docker-machine. But, it looks like the swarm is broken, in any case.
7 [2017-01-16T03:48:05] <kinghuang> How about forcing manager1 out of swarm mode, and re-initializing it as a manager?
8 [2017-01-16T03:48:27] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: agreed. will try that now...
9 [2017-01-16T03:48:40] <kinghuang>  [<-CODE->]
10 [2017-01-16T03:50:00] <sabrehagen> kinghuang: my cluster seems to be broken. i keep encountering this: [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-01-16T03:50:15] <kinghuang> galvesribeiro: Ah, I haven't tried on Windows 10, either! My server nodes as RHEL 7 VMs. And, I've used Docker for Mac.
12 [2017-01-16T03:51:42] <kinghuang> sabrehagen: Hmm, manager1 is probably stuck trying to process other swarm commands.
13 [2017-01-16T04:19:04] <kinghuang> sabrehagen: For what it's worth, I've just downloaded VirtualBox and used docker-machine to create a two-node swarm without problems. Here's a copy of my terminal commands and output. [<-LINK->]
14 [2017-01-16T04:59:51] <kinghuang> sabrehagen: That's really weird that it thinks worker1 is already part of the swarm. You're totally sure that $WORKER1_IP is correct? What happens if you leave out the --listen-addr argument?
15 [2017-01-16T05:16:11] <kinghuang> sabrehagen: Not sure what to suggest! The only major difference that I can see is you're using Docker 1.12.6, while my test run was using Docker 1.13.0-rc7.
16 [2017-01-16T05:16:34] <kinghuang> That said, I've never had problems with 1.12.x like this. But, that was on RHEL 7 VMs, not VirtualBox VMs created with docker-machine.
17 [2017-01-16T05:19:57] <kinghuang> Not sure how it works with docker-machine. That's just what it downloaded for me when I created my first docker-machine machine.
18 [2017-01-16T05:23:44] <kinghuang> sabrehagen: Sorry, I don't know much about docker-machine! For installs on your own VM, you can get release candidates by installing fromhttps://test.docker.com/. Good luck!

1 [2017-01-16T09:51:50] <milanvdmria> I have the following compose to setup Airflow: [<-CODE->] But when I do a docker-compose, I dont see the echos of the entrypoints of those two dockerfiles. How can I execute the entrypoints with a compose (so that the database for examples gets initialized).
2 [2017-01-16T10:51:00] <milanvdmria> I got it running, had the parameter -d so I couldnt see the output of my entrypoints and therefore thought it was not running.
3 [2017-01-16T10:51:21] <milanvdmria> Other question, Airflow needs to connect to the docker with postgres.
4 [2017-01-16T10:51:55] <milanvdmria> Therefore I have to create a jdbc url but I am unsure on how to create that. What is the host for example?
5 [2017-01-16T12:48:28] <milanvdmria> The host seems to be the name in the docker compose file
6 [2017-01-16T12:48:37] <milanvdmria> So that is solved too now

1 [2017-01-16T17:25:16] <galvesribeiro> ok... just got confirmation... Swarm-mode is not available on windows yet (D4W or Windows Server containers)
2 [2017-01-16T17:25:24] <galvesribeiro> so, I have a question...
3 [2017-01-16T17:29:07] <galvesribeiro> Is there a way to create a container network in Docker that span multiple nodes/servers?
4 [2017-01-16T17:29:24] <galvesribeiro> (without using swarm. for example 2 stand alone docker hosts)
5 [2017-01-16T17:30:05] <kinghuang> galvesribeiro: No, you need swarm mode and overlay networks for that.
6 [2017-01-16T17:30:19] <galvesribeiro> :(
7 [2017-01-16T17:31:04] <galvesribeiro> kinghuang: so create a new orchestrator/cluster management is impossible?
8 [2017-01-16T17:32:24] <kinghuang> Well, you could certainly use other networking tools to create your own VLANs and  stuff. But, to use Docker's native functionality for spanning networks across multiple engines, you'll need Swarm mode.
9 [2017-01-16T17:33:21] <galvesribeiro> :(
10 [2017-01-16T17:38:13] <galvesribeiro> that is frustrating :(
11 [2017-01-16T17:44:06] <galvesribeiro> kinghuang: looks like would need to create a network driver/plugin [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-01-16T18:07:25] <kinghuang> Each item in that list is a layer in the image.
13 [2017-01-16T18:08:51] <kinghuang> Images are composed of layers. When an image is created from a Dockerfile, each instruction results in a new layer. See [<-LINK->] in Docker Overview.
14 [2017-01-16T18:09:13] <jeud> thanks@kinghuang:)
15 [2017-01-16T19:18:11] <kinghuang> The publish argument is in the wrong place. You've passed-p 27017:27017as a command to the container. So, when the container starts, it tries to run-p 27017:27017instead ofmongodas the command, fails, and exits.
16 [2017-01-16T19:18:15] <kinghuang> What you want isdocker run --name mongo -d -p 27017:27017 mongo.
17 [2017-01-16T19:19:10] <kinghuang> That way-p(--publish) is an argument to theruncommand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-16T17:59:48] <jeud> hi when downloading an image what are in the list of this download ?
2 [2017-01-16T18:02:05] <jeud> i meant, the image is split into multiple pieces or each piece is a commit of the image repository ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-16T18:58:50] <diegoaguilar> I trieddocker run --name mongo -d mongo -p 27017:27017to start a mongo container with port 20017 exposed to host

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-16T20:21:14] <milanvdmria> Can a Docker on a host call another docker container on the same host?
2 [2017-01-16T20:21:44] <milanvdmria> (if they are on the same network due to docker-compose)
3 [2017-01-16T20:21:56] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Containers on the same docker network can communicate with each other.
4 [2017-01-16T20:22:44] <kinghuang> If you don't specify a network for your Docker Compose services, they'll both be on thedefaultnetwork for that compose project.
5 [2017-01-16T20:23:08] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: Oke, because I find [<-LINK->] quite confusing on what the exact command is to execute adocker runfrom the other container.
6 [2017-01-16T20:28:41] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Are you trying to connect to a network created from a Docker Compose project, from a container started outside of compose usingdocker run?
7 [2017-01-16T20:29:01] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: Inside the docker compose
8 [2017-01-16T20:29:38] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: So one container of the compose to another one in the compose.
9 [2017-01-16T20:29:38] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: All the services inside your Docker Compose project belong to the same network, unless you specify otherwise.
10 [2017-01-16T20:30:21] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: So can you just calldocker runthen? Will it link to the container running in the compose network?
11 [2017-01-16T20:30:31] <milanvdmria> Or do you need some extra parameters?
12 [2017-01-16T20:31:05] <kinghuang> No, if you calldocker runto start a container that's not started by Docker Compose, then you will need to specify the network that Docker Compose created to access those services.
13 [2017-01-16T20:32:05] <kinghuang> Assuming you didn't specify any networks in your Docker Compose file, the network will be named$PROJECT_NAME_default. If you didn't specify a project name, it is based on the name of the directory that your compose file is in.
14 [2017-01-16T20:33:10] <kinghuang> So, let's say your compose file is in a directory named “myproject”. Then, to run a separate container attached to the network that your Docker Compose services are in, you'd dodocker run ---network myproject_default ….
15 [2017-01-16T20:36:13] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: Thanks!I found that defining a project name in the compose file is still not possible, is that correct? Because that makes it quite awkward to know this parameter for the network.
16 [2017-01-16T20:37:36] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: There's a few ways to define the project name.
17 [2017-01-16T20:38:10] <kinghuang> First, you can pass--project-nameor-pto thedocker-composecommand.
18 [2017-01-16T20:38:56] <kinghuang> Docker Compose can also pick up the project name from theCOMPOSE_PROJECT_NAMEenvironment variable.
19 [2017-01-16T20:39:31] <kinghuang> Personally, I set my project name in a.envfile to go with my compose files.
20 [2017-01-16T20:40:09] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: I like that last one. Can docker compose read this file as input?
21 [2017-01-16T20:41:20] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Yes, Docker Compose reads everything in.envand uses it for default environment variables. See “ [<-LINK->] ” for more info.
22 [2017-01-16T20:41:46] <milanvdmria> Thats cool, thanks!
23 [2017-01-16T20:43:40] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: You're welcome!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-16T21:39:26] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: Ive set everything up to come to the conclusion that you need docker in docker to run adocker runcommand of course.Ive looked around and it seems that this kind of behaviour is discouraged. Is there any workaround to execute adocker runcommand without installing docker in docker?
2 [2017-01-16T21:40:13] <milanvdmria> You can do it with the-vflag it seems. How would this translate into docker-compose?
3 [2017-01-16T21:40:40] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: I assume you're talking about callingdocker run …from within a container? What would you like do accomplish with it?
4 [2017-01-16T21:42:06] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: I would like to run a python script in another container from another docker in the same network.
5 [2017-01-16T21:43:18] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Ok, and you want to issue the command to run the Python contain from inside another container?
6 [2017-01-16T21:43:57] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: Indeed. Something asdocker run --network ... python script.py
7 [2017-01-16T21:45:43] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: If you really need to do that from inside the container, mounting /var/run/docker.sock into the calling container will work. In the Docker Compose file, you would simply have the following in the service declaration: [<-CODE->]
8 [2017-01-16T21:47:14] <kinghuang> Then, the container can communicate with the Docker Engine that it's running on.
9 [2017-01-16T21:49:38] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: It still gives the error that thedockercommand is not found.
10 [2017-01-16T21:50:11] <milanvdmria> I only need to add the line to volumes for the docker container I want to run the command in I suppose?
11 [2017-01-16T21:50:16] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Well, that just gives you access to the socket. You still need the Docker client installed.
12 [2017-01-16T21:50:22] <milanvdmria> Ah
13 [2017-01-16T21:50:50] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: So I still need to install docker on my alpine then.
14 [2017-01-16T21:52:02] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Yes. Depending on what your needs and design are, you can also start with the [<-LINK->] . I do this for CI tasks that build Docker images and other Docker operations.
15 [2017-01-16T21:52:54] <kinghuang> Not the dind tags, but the plain (or git) tags, with/var/run/docker.sockmounted in.
16 [2017-01-16T21:55:02] <kinghuang> For example: [<-CODE->]
17 [2017-01-16T23:23:05] <milanvdmria> kinghuang: How could I solvedial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.?
18 [2017-01-16T23:40:38] <kinghuang> milanvdmria: Do you modify the user in your container? If it's not running as root, then you'll need to set permissions as appropriate to your setup so that the user inside your container can access/var/run/docker.sock.
19 [2017-01-17T09:30:51] <milanvdmria> @dragon788 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
20 [2017-01-17T09:31:32] <milanvdmria> And the airflow one runs under aUSER airflow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T05:04:09] <dragon788> milanvdmria: you also need to put the user running docker outside of the container in the docker group or use sudo, this gives them access to that socket
2 [2017-01-17T05:05:38] <dragon788> If you have a full example of what you are trying to do we may be able to propose a better way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T11:09:25] <jaguarg> hi, I have been trying to figure out an issue for a few days.
2 [2017-01-17T11:09:50] <jaguarg> my containers is running a service on port 8080
3 [2017-01-17T11:10:04] <jaguarg> this ports is exposed
4 [2017-01-17T11:37:13] <jaguarg> a68c91a7977b        d7d996294eb6        "/usr/bin/run_authori"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8545->8545/tcp, 8180/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30302->30300/tcp   lonely_cori
5 [2017-01-17T11:37:38] <jaguarg> but I can't connect to these ports on my host
6 [2017-01-17T11:37:42] <jaguarg> any idea ?
7 [2017-01-17T11:38:02] <jaguarg> when I login to the container, I can confirm that the services are running on the ports
8 [2017-01-17T11:38:12] <jaguarg> but not accessble from the host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T12:02:58] <milanvdmria>  [<-CODE->] Im trying todocker runfrom inside a docker to another docker container on the network. But I got a permission denied on the socket. I looked around and it seemed that I had to add the user to the docker group.But im using Alpine and it says in my setup it cannot find the docker service.
2 [2017-01-17T12:32:28] <milanvdmria> I also am looking into [<-LINK->] and check the--privilegedparameter. But it is quite unclear on how to use this to call another container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T13:12:43] <marcelmfs> milanvdmria: don't use privileged, you'll have to mount the docker socket from the host into the container, don't do docker in docker, it's best to do docker outside docker as in [<-LINK->] ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T14:48:16] <sdikby> how can i upgrade my docker installation to 1.12.6 ??
2 [2017-01-17T14:52:26] <marcelmfs> it's stable, so it should be safe to do it
3 [2017-01-17T18:54:47] <sdikby> SISheogorath: folloying the instrcution in the docker website
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T16:30:42] <jaguarg> hello is anybody using docker to package parity ?
2 [2017-01-17T16:33:55] <jaguarg> looks like I can't access the any of the parity ports from the host
3 [2017-01-17T16:34:10] <jaguarg> when connected to the vm, i can see all is working ok
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T16:34:17] <atul1989> can anyone help me to configure the docker private registry , i am hooked one place , i launched registry 2 container , and service is running , dont know where which config file need to configure , docker tag is working fine , but while push the image into same registry it is giving me following message , dont know what it is ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T16:59:31] <killerspaz> atul1989: you didn't post any message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T17:03:56] <marcelmfs> Has anyone here been able to use hardware acceleration (DRI) in a headless Xvfb container to run protractor tests on WebGL enabled pages?
2 [2017-01-17T17:05:05] <marcelmfs> I've tried to share the/tmp/.X11-unixsocket,/dev/drmdevices, and enablexhost +forwarding but still getting timeout when trying to target a page with canvas with protractor...
3 [2017-01-17T17:09:33] <killerspaz> haven't attempted DRI yet, but will need to soon, I'd be interested to see your findings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T18:44:41] <SISheogorath> sdikby: how did you install docker?
2 [2017-01-17T19:04:18] <SISheogorath> in case you are on linux you should upgrade it using your regular package managment.
3 [2017-01-17T19:04:46] <SISheogorath> In case you are on windows or osx download the package you used to install and install it over your existing setup
4 [2017-01-17T19:05:47] <SISheogorath> please notice that upgrading the dockerengine should stop all your currently running containers
5 [2017-01-17T19:06:20] <SISheogorath> make sure they are up again after an upgrade. In case you did not use the--restartparameter you may have to restart them manually
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T19:18:08] <jacobus-brogly> killerspaz: your ignorance of how a package manager works, right?_thats a retarded remark since there is no docker installed on my system what so ever... yes i checked with yum...has nothing to do with Docker, has to do with how your system already has a docker daemon installed.I explicitly stated docker on centos distro is trying to install 2 conflicting packages, again no docker isntalled; nada!  I commend you for having telepathic abilities so you can see what I have on my machine
2 [2017-01-17T19:20:49] <SISheogorath> Are you still stugeling with the SELinux rules@jacobus-brogly?
3 [2017-01-17T19:25:11] <jacobus-brogly> Sheogorath, no i explictly installed  with the package full name  .docker...noarch.x84...
4 [2017-01-17T19:25:16] <jacobus-brogly> instead of docker-engine
5 [2017-01-17T19:25:25] <jacobus-brogly> and the  error went away
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-17T19:28:17] <SISheogorath> I see. Any way to reproduce the error if it\'s not a "personal setup problem" :D As we should file a bug report in case there are conflicts that are based on common setups
2 [2017-01-18T02:43:17] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: related to [<-ISSUE->] there should be a swagger specs somewhere
3 [2017-01-18T02:43:55] <SISheogorath> Not sure where ^^ but somewhere it should exist
4 [2017-01-18T02:45:20] <galvesribeiro> yay
5 [2017-01-18T02:45:23] <galvesribeiro> indeed it has

13 [2017-01-18T02:58:02] <galvesribeiro> hahaha
14 [2017-01-18T02:58:19] <galvesribeiro> it is called automatic properties
15 [2017-01-18T02:58:27] <galvesribeiro> to avoid you have backing fields
16 [2017-01-18T02:58:32] <galvesribeiro> the compiler generate them for you
17 [2017-01-18T03:06:56] <SISheogorath> I still prefer pointer

1 [2017-01-18T02:25:53] <galvesribeiro> hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T02:26:14] <jeffsui> hi what's up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T02:26:25] <galvesribeiro> is there any doc that describe the structure of docker Monitoring events reported by/eventsremote API?
2 [2017-01-18T02:26:36] <galvesribeiro> I want the json structure
3 [2017-01-18T02:26:44] <galvesribeiro> there is just a couple of sample in docs page
4 [2017-01-18T02:26:52] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-18T02:35:52] <galvesribeiro> anyone?@SISheogorath?
6 [2017-01-18T02:43:48] <galvesribeiro> I found this [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-01-18T02:43:54] <galvesribeiro> done if it is just it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T06:13:15] <nischay30> hi tell me one thingif i have containers running with docker compose and network is created ..no if i want to link the same network to other docker compose file..can i link?
2 [2017-01-18T06:13:23] <nischay30> *now
3 [2017-01-18T06:15:13] <gadget_mnky_twitter> Just define the network as external
4 [2017-01-18T06:15:18] <gadget_mnky_twitter> In the other compose file
5 [2017-01-18T06:17:17] <nischay30> thanks a lot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T06:40:05] <NargiT> Hey guys is there a gitter for hub.docker ? Or I can complain here
2 [2017-01-18T06:40:06] <NargiT> ?
3 [2017-01-18T15:21:23] <SISheogorath> NargiT: currently there is no channel for Hub. Maybe try the docker forums
4 [2017-01-18T15:21:53] <SISheogorath> buts101: how would you do it without docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T13:06:24] <cedvdb> Hey, I'm a bit rusty with docker,  I have an instance of cassandra that is in a docker, assuming it's running on port 9042 can I connect from my pc onto it ? [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-01-18T13:17:42] <cedvdb> 0.0.0.0:9042->9042/tcp
3 [2017-01-18T13:22:22] <gadget_mnky_twitter> You should be able to
4 [2017-01-18T13:22:30] <gadget_mnky_twitter> Oh wait
5 [2017-01-18T13:22:34] <gadget_mnky_twitter> The port is not bound yet
6 [2017-01-18T14:02:15] <cedvdb> I'm out, going on holiday, have a nice day
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T14:16:42] <buts101> how to sync php-mysql web application sync on two docker host?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T18:09:12] <JnMik> cedvdb: docker exec -ti <image_id> bash for connect into shell
2 [2017-01-18T18:10:00] <JnMik> cedvdb: if you wanna check if 9042 is listening on your host, try telnet onto it or just use netstat -tulpn and see if your computer is listening on that port
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T18:09:13] <killerspaz> Using docker registry:2, TLS enabled, I can't seem to get a CURL request to the v2 api to delete images... Server keeps saying not a TLS handshake, but I'm using--cacertwith my curl command... Any ideas?
2 [2017-01-18T18:15:42] <killerspaz> omfg, i figured it out... i was hitting http, but it requires https... DUHHHH
3 [2017-01-18T18:19:32] <galvesribeiro> :P
4 [2017-01-18T18:19:36] <galvesribeiro> that happens :D
5 [2017-01-18T18:21:34] <killerspaz> alright, still having issues though... i can query the catalog, but can't access any of the actual repositories... also, just hitting /v2 gives me an empty json object, where docs say it should indicate version info and pathing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T21:56:45] <milanvdmria> From inside a docker container, I calldocker-compose -f file.yml run some-name python script.pymultiple times.I getCannot create container for service some-name: Conflict. The name...as error. Does this mean that I cannot run multipledocker-compose runin parallel?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-18T22:16:55] <dragon788> milanvdmria: you want to do a "docker-compose scale" if you want to run more containers iirc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T01:11:56] <neiled> I want a docker container to build my assets, then I want nginx to server them in another container. Should I use volumes for that? Should I serve the generated assets from a volume?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T02:41:48] <SISheogorath> If it's a simple build process it's easier to extend the nginx container and build your assets during a docker build process. Reason: it's a lot easier to scale. But if you really want to build it in separated containers, yes, volumes are the way to go.
2 [2017-01-19T02:42:14] <SISheogorath> neiled: see above
3 [2017-01-19T08:06:34] <SISheogorath> nischay30: Hostmapping? Can you explain what exactly you mean?
4 [2017-01-19T08:09:20] <SISheogorath> brunocfnba: In most cases this error appears when your entrypoint script orCMDis not intended the right place, Missing +x or has another error like missing Linux file endings if you build the container on Windows. You can may explain or link how you created the image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T02:54:16] <brunocfnba> Hey, I need to run a simple docker compose file with 2 services. I\'m using the entrypoint command in compose and getting this error when I run itinvalid header field value "oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused \\"exec: \\Anyone faced this already?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T05:50:02] <atul1989> how can you please let me know how can configure private docker registry first tiem, i has been install and start the registry server on centos 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T05:50:58] <nischay30> hello,suppose i have compose file in which there is only one service named dockercloud/hell-world . now i want to do host-mapping for this service.how should i do it?i dont want to make a entry in /etc/hosts manually
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T13:58:09] <arputcu> hello i use docker with restart policy always where can i found any history when the docker conatiner was restarted?
2 [2017-01-19T13:58:20] <arputcu> i only can found the last start time
3 [2017-01-19T13:58:33] <am0nshi> arputcu: docker ps?
4 [2017-01-19T13:58:52] <arputcu> am0nshi: docker ps shows me the last start
5 [2017-01-19T13:58:59] <arputcu> but not all bevore
6 [2017-01-19T13:59:05] <arputcu> not?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T14:45:42] <killerspaz> brunocfnba: can you give us more info about how you're starting?
2 [2017-01-19T14:46:42] <killerspaz> nischay30: check out docker networking, which is built into docker-compose through config: [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-01-19T16:00:25] <killerspaz> marcusrios: just dealt with this last night... did you get the image digest first?
4 [2017-01-19T16:01:37] <killerspaz> use-vwhen curling to see the header response onGET /v2/<name>/manifests/<tagName>, you'll see aDocker-Content-Digestheader which is the SHA you need to use to delete with
5 [2017-01-19T16:04:29] <marcusrios> Yes@killerspaz. I run the follow command:curl -i -XGET "http://docker-registry-server:5000/v2/any-app/manifests/tag1"And I using the Docker-Content-Digest in the DELETE command
6 [2017-01-19T16:04:32] <killerspaz> marcusrios: I made some dumb functions to help me out with it: [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-01-19T16:05:31] <killerspaz> also, i think the key isenablednotenable
8 [2017-01-19T16:06:09] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->]
9 [2017-01-19T16:06:19] <killerspaz> yep.... i was bit by the same thing... change that and restart
10 [2017-01-19T16:06:31] <killerspaz> fyi, if that's all you're changing, i suggest using the env var(s)
11 [2017-01-19T16:08:25] <killerspaz> Here's my compose config for npm, bower, docker, and docker web services: [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-01-19T16:08:59] <killerspaz> you can see I useREGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED: "true"
13 [2017-01-19T16:17:15] <killerspaz> marcusrios: any luck?
14 [2017-01-19T16:18:41] <marcusrios> killerspaz: Until now nothing.The delete really option was wrong, but even after changing the problem persists
15 [2017-01-19T16:19:35] <killerspaz> hmmm... not sure why you'd still get that error....
16 [2017-01-19T17:12:48] <marcusrios> @killerspazProblem solved. [<-CODE->] Thank's for the help :D
17 [2017-01-19T18:01:35] <killerspaz> marcusrios: - I've tried without it, and it was working for me.... so i figured I'd leave it off... still, that's lame to have to accept that header for a DIGEST.
18 [2017-01-19T18:03:19] <killerspaz> marcusrios: also, that won't delete the images off disk, it just marks it for garbage collection and removes it from the db.. you need to run manual garbage collection to delete them [<-LINK->]
19 [2017-01-19T23:55:16] <killerspaz> Has anyone messed with rsyslog in containers? I got it running, but hostnames are some kind of UUID and not the service name I was expecting... curious if anyone knows any tricks
20 [2017-01-20T02:10:19] <killerspaz> i'm trying to think of the best way of gathering all the various information outputs... lshw, lsusb, etc etc....  i was originally thinking rsyslog, but now that seems cumbersome in a way.
21 [2017-01-20T02:10:57] <killerspaz> i wanted each container to tell me their knowledge to build a profile of the compose
22 [2017-01-20T02:11:33] <killerspaz> from a sysadmin pov that is.... was thinking of rsyslog to elasticsearch
23 [2017-01-20T03:20:25] <killerspaz> dragon788: not sure what you mean fully... but I want to see a profile of the system information; stuff i'm messing with deals a lot with connected devices, data streams through said devices, and logging. So i wanted to capture that from the various containers into a single container that would batch send them to a central system.
24 [2017-01-20T03:21:09] <killerspaz> well, for example, one container is responsible for all the udev controls, so in theory I would make it responsible for logging necessary information
25 [2017-01-20T03:22:04] <killerspaz> and the other thing i didn't mention is there could be thousands of these deployments, not just one, and internet connectivity isn't guaranteed. So in a common case, data will have to persist locally until it can be brought online.
26 [2017-01-20T03:22:07] <killerspaz> yeah
27 [2017-01-20T03:22:22] <killerspaz> lots of crazy volume stuff, misc communcation ports, sub nets, etc etc
28 [2017-01-20T03:22:32] <killerspaz> wel, crazy to me, maybe not to others
29 [2017-01-20T03:23:39] <killerspaz> your typical "cloud instance manager" wouldn\'t really cut it for this i don\'t believe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T15:56:51] <marcusrios> Hello guys, [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Anyone have this problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-19T17:57:30] <thiagopecanha> Hey guys, I am trying to use secret in docker beta 1.13.0-rc7 to share my local ssh-key to my dev container, however I have a few questions about it... as it is something RC, I've not found too much support for that yet.... Do you have any advice or another way to do it? pls...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T00:57:41] <dragon788> I believe there are some options for capturing the output of containers, typically you run the service in the foreground and have it dumped to standard out and then use Docker commands to capture the standard out or attached to that process
2 [2017-01-20T03:18:19] <dragon788> killerspaz: that sounds more like reverse engineering the host which is limited by the cgroup permissions granted to containers
3 [2017-01-20T03:20:32] <dragon788> Since the OS inside the container is really secondary to the application (s) it is hosting all that information doesn't seem incredibly useful, if you really need it a container with puppet or chef would have 'facts' you could examine regarding all that info
4 [2017-01-20T03:22:02] <dragon788> Ahhh, are you doing USB connected devices and other types with a single container sharing to others?
5 [2017-01-20T03:23:47] <dragon788> Are containers really the best way to do this? I know it's a buzz word technology but sometimes the overhead of architecting that kind of solution kills the advantages of containers vs VMs
6 [2017-01-20T03:24:04] <killerspaz> well our system is very modular so it actually fits very well imo
7 [2017-01-20T03:24:23] <killerspaz> easier than building custom images and compiling them every time, we just have services that we swap out
8 [2017-01-20T03:25:07] <killerspaz> just different rancheros configs for different setups
9 [2017-01-20T03:48:36] <dragon788> That's pretty slick
10 [2017-01-20T03:55:37] <killerspaz> i think so, it's been a lot of fun and headaches :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T02:54:13] <redhedded1> I wrote this the other day, it is long and filled with code, but may give you some ideas. [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-01-20T02:54:53] <redhedded1> it is my first attempt at doing any monitoring/logging management - feedback/corrections are welcome of course
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T04:29:58] <originalsosa> Has anyone solved the issue with a host with multiple network interfaces being able to route traffic to the docker container? e.g I have eth0 and eth1 serving external traffic that needs to be routed to my container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T08:44:34] <nischay30> hii have one issuei created a swarm with two systems.1 is manager and 1 is workernow i have deployed two services1 is deployed on my manager system and other one on my vagrant box which is worker.1 service is occupying 3000 port and other one 8080 port.now when i try to curl the service which is deployed on my system i am able to do that but the other service i am not able to>
2 [2017-01-20T08:44:44] <nischay30> can anybody explain me why?
3 [2017-01-20T13:23:10] <nischay30> SISheogorath: Thanks i figured out later.that was the issue
4 [2017-01-20T13:23:44] <nischay30> any reference to use the docker events for services through Apis

1 [2017-01-20T10:34:48] <argeas> hi all ! anyone has managed to get containers with maven isntalled ... withouth needing to install maven everytime a container starts ?
2 [2017-01-20T12:47:04] <argeas> SISheogorath: do you mean : mvn install ? or the package of maven while I build the docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T10:39:38] <SISheogorath> originalsosa: As containers are kind of abtraction on userspace level (mostly) and routing is something you do in kernel space it's not the best idea to do it in container. Sure you can do it with docker but it possibly breaks the isolation. I would recommend you the usage of a VM in this case. it's better for isolated kernel operations. If you only need to route traffic directly to your container thant you should use another network driver like macvlan or ipvlan
2 [2017-01-20T10:40:19] <SISheogorath> nischay30: did you create an overlay network for you application and joined your services in? if not you should do that ;)
3 [2017-01-20T10:40:45] <SISheogorath> argeas: How about installing maven while your docker build process?
4 [2017-01-20T19:10:16] <SISheogorath> argeas: What every you want to install :D
5 [2017-01-20T19:12:55] <SISheogorath> nischay30: services like? [<-LINK->] ?
6 [2017-01-21T16:37:12] <SISheogorath> buts101: context?
7 [2017-01-21T16:38:05] <SISheogorath> erichermansson: What kind of network bridge do you mean? Docker uses a Linux network bridge by default. (in case you are on Linux)
8 [2017-01-21T16:39:22] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro:
9 [2017-01-21T16:41:13] <SISheogorath> Lol I can't paste into the gitter.im app x.x
10 [2017-01-21T16:41:26] <SISheogorath> I'll send it to you in slack
11 [2017-01-21T16:41:26] <galvesribeiro> man, gitter and slack are terrible
12 [2017-01-21T16:41:34] <galvesribeiro> freaking slow and buggy
13 [2017-01-21T16:41:37] <galvesribeiro> ok ;)
14 [2017-01-21T16:43:45] <SISheogorath> I prefer IRC but not for docker. As it is located on Freenode and my backlog on Freenode has thousands and thousands of messages :/ I try to avoid opening it
15 [2017-01-21T16:44:08] <galvesribeiro> hehehe
16 [2017-01-21T16:44:10] <galvesribeiro> yeah
17 [2017-01-21T16:44:15] <galvesribeiro> I loved IRC
18 [2017-01-21T16:44:22] <galvesribeiro> unfortunately people dropped it
19 [2017-01-21T16:44:23] <galvesribeiro> anyway
20 [2017-01-21T16:44:28] <galvesribeiro> I got your message there
21 [2017-01-21T16:44:33] <galvesribeiro> and yes, I saw the spotify one
22 [2017-01-21T16:44:44] <galvesribeiro> but it has the zookeeper server in it
23 [2017-01-21T16:44:52] <galvesribeiro> not sure if it is a good approach for production
24 [2017-01-21T16:44:55] <galvesribeiro> will research on that
25 [2017-01-21T16:45:08] <galvesribeiro> thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T15:26:39] <galvesribeiro> anyone ever used Kafka in docker?
2 [2017-01-21T15:27:33] <galvesribeiro> ouch
3 [2017-01-21T15:27:41] <galvesribeiro> there is no official container :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T15:40:50] <buts101> SISheogorath: how then?
2 [2017-01-21T16:41:07] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: ?
3 [2017-01-21T16:41:20] <galvesribeiro> hhahaha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T16:31:44] <erichermansson> Anyone know how to get bridged networking in docker?
2 [2017-01-21T16:52:12] <erichermansson> SISheogorath: the bridge im talking about is the kind of bridge I use on my KVM. Like the instans can be accessible via my router
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T17:00:02] <kinghuang> galvesribeiro: We use Kafka in Docker. Ended up building our own images for [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] , and [<-LINK->] .
2 [2017-01-21T17:00:48] <kinghuang>  [<-LINK->] has images, too, which we started with. But, they're not very well maintained and too bulky.
3 [2017-01-21T17:01:53] <kinghuang> galvesribeiro: You still need ZooKeeper. We switched to the [<-LINK->] . It got added recently.
4 [2017-01-21T17:02:06] <galvesribeiro> ok
5 [2017-01-21T17:02:08] <galvesribeiro> understood
6 [2017-01-21T17:02:30] <galvesribeiro> I'm considering add a Stream provider for Orleans usign Kafka
7 [2017-01-21T17:02:52] <galvesribeiro> today there are abunch  others like Azure Queue services and Azure ServiceBus/EventHub
8 [2017-01-21T17:03:02] <galvesribeiro> but linux users are asking us to have it
9 [2017-01-21T17:03:11] <galvesribeiro> and I have a project here that will run on linux
10 [2017-01-21T17:03:29] <galvesribeiro> so I probably will need Kafka as it is the most used stream solution
11 [2017-01-21T17:03:56] <galvesribeiro> just considering that it needs a lot of things to get to work
12 [2017-01-21T17:04:11] <galvesribeiro> too much moving parts :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T17:00:43] <galvesribeiro> kinghuang: nice :D so we don't need zookeeper?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-21T17:05:06] <kinghuang> galvesribeiro: Cool. It's working well for us deployed as a stack on Docker (swarm mode). We're mainly using it for stream data out of PostgreSQL with [<-LINK->] right now. We'll be doing more development in the upcoming months.
2 [2017-01-21T17:06:00] <galvesribeiro> nice! thanks@kinghuang, will have a look on that :D
3 [2017-01-21T17:07:01] <kinghuang> We've got our own image for bottledwater, too. It's being migrated from our private GitLab server to GitHub and Docker Hub next week.
4 [2017-01-21T17:17:42] <galvesribeiro> kinghuang: I'm new on kafka and ZK, so as much as a read, I have the feeling that its performance and resiliecen relytoo muchon ZK...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-22T17:25:39] <w0rldart> Hey guys! I have created a Swarm (1 manager, 3 workers) on DigitalOcean, each of 512mb
2 [2017-01-22T17:25:58] <w0rldart> Now, I was wondering what's best in terms of deploying an image to production
3 [2017-01-22T17:26:18] <w0rldart> this Docker image, is built to handle multiple sites
4 [2017-01-22T17:26:27] <w0rldart> this one exactly [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-01-22T17:26:56] <w0rldart> now, so far I have been reading that it's best to deploy one container per app
6 [2017-01-22T17:27:14] <w0rldart> under what case I would deploy one container that can serve multiple apps?
7 [2017-01-22T19:29:19] <w0rldart> SISheogorath: fantastic explanation! Thank you so much
8 [2017-01-22T19:29:22] <w0rldart> I thought so too
9 [2017-01-22T19:29:41] <w0rldart> but it just gets confusing with people doing so many alternatives
10 [2017-01-22T19:31:02] <w0rldart> Question is though, knowing that Docker Swarm already does some load balancing, should I look into additional load balancing for Nginx via HaProxy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-22T18:52:58] <SISheogorath> @w0rldart There should be no case where you deploy multiple apps per container. But there are some images out there who does it. Reason for this is that those images are more or less a bootstrap script for a virtual machine. Not really good. But very simple to build.I took a short look at the side and I'm not sure if it is a good idea to use it as they describe. For example I would place one container per wordpress side using the official wordpress image and also let TLS handled by an API driven Reverse proxy like Traefik. So you never run into a problem with certificates and you can really microservice it.By the way: Another important benefit from one Site per container is that you can create backups by simple snapshot the volume. And if you have to restore a blog you can simple take a snapshot, boot your database and blog up again from that snapshotted volume and everything is fine. While you have to run ugly backup scripts etc. when you have all blogs in a single database as you run a mutli-site setup.
2 [2017-01-22T18:55:40] <galvesribeiro> I just realized that docker for Mac is a VM as well...
3 [2017-01-22T18:55:58] <galvesribeiro> once were VirtualBox, now on 1.13 it is HyperKit
4 [2017-01-22T18:56:03] <galvesribeiro> still a VM
5 [2017-01-22T19:32:55] <SISheogorath> We don't do additional load balancing. You have x Instances of you reverse proxy and X instances of your service. Trafik itself handles the traffic than and/or  if you use nginx you can simply address the service you want to use. For short therm connections it's not a problem
6 [2017-01-22T19:33:53] <SISheogorath> if we talk about long therm connections with heavy resource usage you can start writing custom load banancing or scale your service because right now the L4-LB in swarm mode only does RR over all tasks
7 [2017-01-22T19:36:00] <w0rldart> Sorry, would you mind defining L4  and RR please? I have not seen those terminologies before
8 [2017-01-22T19:38:26] <SISheogorath> L4 := Layer 4 (referring to the ISO/OSI model in therms of protocols TCP/UDP)RR := Round Robin
9 [2017-01-22T19:38:42] <w0rldart> oh right! Thank you  very much for your help
10 [2017-01-22T19:39:17] <w0rldart> going to stalk you for a bit on github now
11 [2017-01-22T19:39:45] <SISheogorath> Further information: L4 -> [<-LINK->] RR-> [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-01-22T19:40:03] <SISheogorath> Feel free to do that and take a stop at my blog :D
13 [2017-01-23T00:29:40] <w0rldart> thanks@SISheogorathvery useful information
14 [2017-01-23T00:30:56] <w0rldart> What is the way to deploy my local volumes for my project (wordpress and mysql) to my swarm? Any thoughts guys?
15 [2017-01-23T00:33:05] <w0rldart> I am working with this docker-composer.yml
16 [2017-01-23T00:33:08] <w0rldart>  [<-LINK->]
17 [2017-01-23T00:48:39] <w0rldart> Looking into Flocker... seems that, that might be the best solutions so far
18 [2017-01-23T01:10:02] <SISheogorath> depending on the size of your project and where you set it up you can also user glusterfs. [<-LINK->]
19 [2017-01-23T02:00:06] <w0rldart> glusterfs is no longer maintained [<-LINK->]
20 [2017-01-23T02:01:11] <w0rldart> "UNMAINTAINED: This library is not maintained anymore. Fork it, copy it or do what you please the the code, but this repository won\'t get updates and fixes."
21 [2017-01-23T02:02:56] <w0rldart> weird because the article you share is from January 7, 2017 whilst GlusterFS repo hadn't had any updates since 6 months ago
22 [2017-01-23T02:55:10] <SISheogorath> glusterfs itself is still maintained. the docker glusterfs driver you linked maybe not
23 [2017-01-23T02:56:11] <SISheogorath> In my project where I used this glusterfs setup we mounted it withbinddriver and have the glusterfs volumes itself mounted on all nodes directly
24 [2017-01-23T02:57:04] <SISheogorath> And you should check the network for the project you linked: [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-01-23T02:57:12] <SISheogorath> there are some maintained forks ^^
26 [2017-01-23T02:58:10] <SISheogorath> But currently flocker is hyped so may use flocker :D haven't tried it right now :X
27 [2017-01-23T03:17:43] <w0rldart> Flocker is shutting down
28 [2017-01-23T03:17:45] <w0rldart>  [<-LINK->]
29 [2017-01-23T03:57:16] <SISheogorath> I would recommend you one container per database. which should also result in one volume per database. As mentioned that's a good for multiple reasons. I menioned backups above but there is also scalability, security, etc. you should try to isolate your services as much as you can in order to prevent bad effects and simplify your further way.
30 [2017-01-23T04:01:43] <SISheogorath> btw thanks for following me on Twitter ;)
31 [2017-01-23T04:04:37] <w0rldart> *github :D
32 [2017-01-23T04:05:00] <w0rldart> twitter now too
33 [2017-01-23T04:05:01] <w0rldart> hah
34 [2017-01-23T04:05:59] <SISheogorath> Oh I missread it :D it was another alex xD
35 [2017-01-23T04:26:29] <SISheogorath> :D Most of the time I read "don\'t use cloud storage providers" no further explaination but I read it multiple times not :D Maybe they are too expensive or they do other crazy stuff ^^ I can refer to myself and run my backups using snapshorts of my volumes so using cloud storage not sure hot it\'ll end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-23T03:33:21] <w0rldart> What do you think is best, a generic volume called mysql (as an example) of 10gb where all the databases live, or a volume per database?
2 [2017-01-23T03:33:40] <w0rldart> problem with a volume per database is that I'd might end up with a lot of volumes
3 [2017-01-23T03:59:03] <w0rldart> Fair point
4 [2017-01-23T03:59:05] <w0rldart> Thank you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-23T04:06:26] <w0rldart> Alright, so what I am going to do next (after a bit of sleep) is to get my self a volume on Digital Ocean on AWS EBS where I can push my volumes, and that way have everything nicely in sync

3 [2017-01-23T04:06:56] <w0rldart> if you didn't know about it
4 [2017-01-23T04:07:17] <w0rldart> and they try and run a docker-composer up on the swarm manager
5 [2017-01-23T04:07:28] <w0rldart> and see whether all hell breaks loose or not

1 [2017-01-23T05:03:12] <vigneshchalapathy> can anyone tell me how to edit source code of project deployed in docker
2 [2017-01-23T05:03:23] <vigneshchalapathy> Operatin system windows
3 [2017-01-23T05:24:56] <vigneshchalapathy> I dont want it in docker.I just want to edit the source code of [<-LINK->] that is available through docker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-23T05:19:40] <soapoperator> Hello, i am progressing step by step with docker, i successeed to run an httpd container. Then i try to run php:7.1.0-apache... it works well for html but not for php?phpinfo() was empty... How explain that?When i run the container which kind of command i have to run?http-foregrounddoes have any sens?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-23T05:20:55] <SISheogorath> @vigneshchalapathy So you have this project you want to modify? (moved from private back to channel) [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-01-23T05:25:15] <SISheogorath>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-01-23T05:26:07] <SISheogorath> vigneshchalapathy: you linked the sourcecode... If you don't want to do anything in docker this channel is the wrong place to ask
4 [2017-01-23T05:26:43] <vigneshchalapathy> sheogorath: yeah ok
5 [2017-01-23T05:26:57] <SISheogorath> mail the developer or anything else. It's provided by GPLv3 so it's open source and you can change what every you want as long as you republicate your changes
6 [2017-01-23T05:27:14] <SISheogorath> And name the authors
7 [2017-01-23T05:27:22] <vigneshchalapathy> But i am asking  how to use docker as a development environent
8 [2017-01-23T05:27:37] <vigneshchalapathy> environment
9 [2017-01-23T05:27:45] <vigneshchalapathy> in windows
10 [2017-01-23T05:27:57] <SISheogorath> well, do your changes, build the container, check if it works. Same game like everywhere else
11 [2017-01-23T05:28:17] <qiyue49> install windows toolbox
12 [2017-01-23T05:28:29] <vigneshchalapathy> ok
13 [2017-01-23T05:28:37] <SISheogorath> but I should mention that their Dockerfile is not the best for using it in a development environment
14 [2017-01-23T05:29:10] <SISheogorath> You can also use Docker for Windows. Depends your way to work
15 [2017-01-23T05:29:49] <vigneshchalapathy> ok thank you
16 [2017-01-23T05:32:23] <vigneshchalapathy> sheogorath: where can i find docker project's source code
17 [2017-01-23T05:36:42] <SISheogorath> Depending on what exactly you're searching for under the docker organisation on github: [<-LINK->]
18 [2017-01-23T05:38:39] <vigneshchalapathy> No,I have deployed a project in docker.where can i find the sourcecode of the project deployed in docker
19 [2017-01-23T05:39:24] <vigneshchalapathy> /mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/containers/f5bc5e550b7d146b09ebcc573b342b1e61a7be545868ef088ccc0b320ba
20 [2017-01-23T05:41:03] <vigneshchalapathy> even i was not able to reach the above directory
21 [2017-01-23T05:44:21] <SISheogorath> where ever you copied it into the container. Please notice that the containers itself are using layered file systems so you can't see it directly as long as the file system is not mounted. Easiest way  to mount it: Run the container and inside the container an sh instance.
22 [2017-01-23T05:47:22] <SISheogorath> may want to read [<-LINK->]
23 [2017-01-23T05:47:56] <SISheogorath> In order to learn how docker handles files in its file system
24 [2017-01-23T05:58:47] <vigneshchalapathy> thank you

1 [2017-01-23T06:28:24] <soapoperator> SISheogorath: thank you for the answer. i change right of my file and it seems to work now (?). If i want to enable mod_rewrite, the better practice if to run the commandea2enmod rewriteat start or to modify the container with terminal?
2 [2017-01-23T06:31:15] <SISheogorath> I personally would extend the container. But you can do it also by running it at startup. Depends on what works better for you. In case you extend the container (means you run it during build process) you can also copy the sources of you application in there. That helps to create a real and useful container application. If you already do it. Place it in the container build process.
3 [2017-01-23T09:33:01] <SISheogorath> in regular that's what docker compose do if something changed
4 [2017-01-23T09:33:28] <SISheogorath> you should change your setup if it is a problem when your container gets destroyed
5 [2017-01-24T00:03:40] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: Check that the user running the container can read the file (means the user inside the container)
6 [2017-01-24T00:04:52] <SISheogorath> rightisleft: You can use a logging driver to send the logs to a central logging instance or usedocker logsinstead of cat

10 [2017-01-24T00:13:18] <SISheogorath> And 2. Move the NPM Install part directly behind your copy process of the package.json

1 [2017-01-23T09:23:29] <matglas86_twitter> Hi there. I have a question about docker compose. I want to assign a new memory limit to a container but on restart it does not propogate from my adjusted compose file to the container. Is there a way to force that without throwing away the container?
2 [2017-01-23T09:24:06] <SISheogorath> docker update<-- ?
3 [2017-01-23T09:24:51] <matglas86_twitter> but that does not work with compose does it?
4 [2017-01-23T09:27:11] <matglas86_twitter> ooh wait I had to use docker-compose up
5 [2017-01-23T09:27:35] <matglas86_twitter> But it did recreate the container :(

3 [2017-01-24T21:43:17] <w0rldart> Having created a Swarm from another machine of mine
4 [2017-01-24T21:43:27] <w0rldart> at DigitalOcean
5 [2017-01-24T21:43:40] <w0rldart> how can I list them on my other machine?
6 [2017-01-24T21:44:04] <w0rldart> so, doingdocker-machine lson machine 1 will list all the machines I have created
7 [2017-01-24T21:44:18] <w0rldart> but doing that onmachine 2will list nothing

1 [2017-01-25T12:40:55] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: actually yes. I met that issue without compose but the service was starting and worked so I ignored it :X
2 [2017-01-25T12:43:47] <SISheogorath> SeanSassenrath: rewrite and proxy pass in the same statement? Sounds like your server answers before it passes the request? (guess) I really prefer Traefik as reverse proxy these days

1 [2017-01-26T19:29:20] <killerspaz> Is there a way to add dns entries on an external service in a docker-compose?  I want my containers to always access the host as "healthSystem" (or something similar), but the real ip/hostname is facaded by docker
2 [2017-01-26T21:02:10] <killerspaz> damn gitter was down
3 [2017-01-26T21:02:24] <killerspaz> ok, i think i found what i needed: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-01-26T21:03:07] <killerspaz> i wish it was available on the network level rather than on the service level :/
5 [2017-01-26T21:05:01] <killerspaz> unless i'm missing something? Seems like having to add an extra_host to every service is kinda lame
6 [2017-01-26T21:25:11] <killerspaz> but is there any guarantee there's a 1 to 1 mapping of these flags for docker-compose?
7 [2017-01-26T21:28:29] <killerspaz> i.e., [<-CODE->]
8 [2017-01-26T21:35:18] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->] lol
9 [2017-01-26T21:35:32] <killerspaz> gonna give it a whirl
10 [2017-01-26T21:36:39] <killerspaz> actually config is an array, so even slightly funkier: [<-CODE->]
11 [2017-01-26T21:40:27] <killerspaz> i must have butchered the syntax cuz it keeps failing....
12 [2017-01-26T21:40:58] <killerspaz> i guess i'm having a hard time understanding is the ipam config a top-level, or under a network?
13 [2017-01-26T21:44:15] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-01-26T21:58:07] <killerspaz> SISheogorath: yeah don't think that'll suffice... apparently any defined hosts there have to be within the subnet
15 [2017-01-26T21:58:59] <killerspaz> AND ihaveto define a subnet, which isn't ideal in my situation

1 [2017-01-27T15:33:31] <killerspaz> I'm sure I know the answer, but there isn't a way to just declare ENV vars in docker-compose.yml is there? Like a block of variable definitions? They have to be defaulted in EVERY single place used?
2 [2017-01-27T15:39:32] <killerspaz> mmm not exactly, I want the opportunity for whoever is spinning up teh service to supply ENV vars, but it's hard to know which ones are needed without scanning an entire config setup (which spans 3 different files as it is).... I'd like to be able to just have a block of variables defined, and their default values: [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-01-27T15:42:45] <killerspaz> that way a user can instantly scan all the values
4 [2017-01-27T15:51:22] <killerspaz> @SISheogorathI'm even not sure what you need this for :X there is dns outside ^^I don't want to run my own DNS, plus a DNS isn't very flexible when working in various environments (dev, test, prod) without creating tons of entries.... The way I'm approaching it is just supply a variable to docker-compose and it'll override the host IP in /etc/hosts
5 [2017-01-27T16:03:15] <killerspaz> I can't affect the compose if it's in an entrypoint script, which we dont' use entrypoints, only commands
6 [2017-01-27T16:05:41] <killerspaz> i think i can get away with multiple env-files
7 [2017-01-27T16:13:08] <killerspaz> clear volumes that aren't being used
8 [2017-01-27T16:13:10] <killerspaz> docker volume ls
9 [2017-01-27T16:13:28] <killerspaz> docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
10 [2017-01-27T16:14:54] <killerspaz> that's dangerous btw, only run that if you don't mind losing persisted data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T15:37:47] <SISheogorath> You mean a central place like for the creation of networks? No. But you can use ENV files and include them
2 [2017-01-27T15:59:27] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: default values are something I assign in the entrypoint script of the container, not the compose file.

1 [2017-01-27T16:12:12] <playground> Hi, I start getting this error today when try to create a docker image Error response from daemon: write /var/lib/docker/image/aufs/.tmp-repositories.json437787979: no space left on deviceHow can I increase space in docker without having to recreate virtualbox?
2 [2017-01-27T16:15:37] <playground> I see three local volumes, how do I know which one to remove
3 [2017-01-27T16:19:03] <playground> killerspaz: How do those volumes get created?
4 [2017-01-27T16:20:30] <killerspaz> based on images you might use from dockerhub, or any volumes you're defining when running containers
5 [2017-01-27T16:20:59] <killerspaz> docker volume inspect VOL_ID | less
6 [2017-01-27T16:29:25] <playground> ok, i try this commanddocker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)but it\'s  complaining ""docker volume rm" requires at least 1 argument(s)."
7 [2017-01-27T16:29:44] <playground> am I using the command correctly?
8 [2017-01-27T16:30:07] <SISheogorath> yes
9 [2017-01-27T16:30:20] <SISheogorath> but that means that you volumes are assigned to a running/existing container
10 [2017-01-27T16:31:19] <playground> hmm
11 [2017-01-27T16:32:04] <SISheogorath> maybe it is easier to dodocker rmi $(docker images -q)but make sure you don't have any non running self build images that you want to keep
12 [2017-01-27T16:36:53] <playground> thanks guys for your help
13 [2017-01-27T16:38:39] <playground> killerspaz: I got one other question, I have this app that I\'m trying to dockerize, when running in the container "docker run -p 49168:4200 new-ng-project", it runs with no error but i can\'t access the app via localhost:49168. Any idea why?
14 [2017-01-27T16:38:55] <killerspaz> if you just want to blast everything you possibly can, here's an alias i wrote i use often while developing: [<-CODE->]

24 [2017-01-27T16:42:34] <killerspaz> might wanna spend some time reading the docs, loooooots to learn that I couldn't just give you in a 10 second spiel.
25 [2017-01-27T16:43:02] <jeffsui> or you can  read [<-LINK->] first :)
26 [2017-01-27T16:43:10] <playground> I know, I lots commands to learn
27 [2017-01-27T16:43:26] <jeffsui> step by step
28 [2017-01-27T16:45:45] <killerspaz> never found books to be all that great, imo.... but that's just me... different people learn differently
29 [2017-01-27T16:46:08] <killerspaz> exactly... books are usually full of bloat, or out dated (granted that one says it's always up to date, i have my doubts)
30 [2017-01-27T16:46:23] <SISheogorath> I love reading books but not for technical things.
31 [2017-01-27T16:47:06] <killerspaz> lol i'm too busy reading docs and source to read anything else :/
32 [2017-01-27T16:47:20] <killerspaz> i've always said I should dedicate time to read fiction
33 [2017-01-27T16:48:40] <jeffsui> that's ok .different people learn docker in different way.
34 [2017-01-27T16:49:21] <playground> so what is a good concise docker reference doc that you can point me to :-)?
35 [2017-01-27T16:50:43] <playground> is this a good start [<-LINK->] ?
36 [2017-01-27T16:52:49] <playground> ok, thanks@jeffsui

38 [2017-01-27T16:53:13] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->] WTF!?!?!
39 [2017-01-27T16:54:06] <killerspaz> even this [<-ISSUE->] says it should be +x... wtf gives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T16:44:32] <SISheogorath> lol I don't know but everytime someone want me to read a book about an application I think it is more useful to read the sourcecode itself :X
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T16:49:53] <killerspaz> so i've been fighting this issue where my scripts with +x on them are -x in the container.... compose not telling me why, etc... finally build manually with docker engine, and of course it tells me:SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. All files and directories added to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive files and directories.
2 [2017-01-27T16:50:17] <killerspaz> buuuuuuut... those aren't the permissions on the file

1 [2017-01-27T18:42:11] <soapoperator> hello, i run a container with php/apache + mariadb + phpmyadmin with docker-compose in a custom network. I would to run  another container... Is it possible to get phpmadmin works with all network together to get one url? Is sharing container recommand by the guidelines of docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T18:52:05] <SISheogorath> The recommendation by best practice says 1 process per container. Now you can think about is phpmyadmin an own process? not really but it's an own application so it's maybe better to  split it into another container because in case you have to scale there is no need in scalaing phpmyadmin. And maybe the scaling of phpmyadmin ends up in race conditions you don't want to have. So my personal answer is: split it out. and to bring them together on the same subdomain use a reverse proxy. My recommendation for this is: traefik.io
2 [2017-01-27T18:52:21] <SISheogorath> but you can also add a simply reverse proxy rule to your apache config
3 [2017-01-27T23:36:00] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: looks like your phpmyadmin is not configured to use the network
4 [2017-01-28T01:09:53] <SISheogorath> maybe it needs tty?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T22:54:35] <soapoperator> @SISheogorath Thank you for your answer.I am trying to split it out. In my container php + mariadb (container 1), i pass environment variable MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD. In my phpmyadmin container (container 2), i pass environment variables MYSQL_USERNAME=root, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and PMA_HOSTS (i try : the ip address of the container 1 and the network name). Unfortunatly i get an error when i try to login: [<-CODE->] Do i have to add php to the container 2? Could it explain the issue?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T22:58:20] <killerspaz> I feel you're kinda missing the point of containers and how they work; might want to research docker a bit more... Try starting here: [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-01-28T00:27:32] <killerspaz> Anyone have any ideas why my rsyslogd dies withRUN rsyslogdin my dockerfile? but if I exec into it, I can start it fine (after killing the pid file erroneously left around)
2 [2017-01-28T01:40:15] <killerspaz> tty for what? it's the host
3 [2017-01-28T01:40:33] <killerspaz> and even when disabling the tcp stuff it still crashes
4 [2017-01-28T02:14:45] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->] my dockerfile.... it seems to run, but no output in docker logs, so i can't even think of where to start debugging
5 [2017-01-28T02:15:10] <killerspaz> CMD is set through docker-compose, that's working fine (runs a node app)
6 [2017-01-28T03:10:25] <killerspaz> bah, figured it out.... I forgotRUNstatements execute during build, not runtime :/ can't believe i was hung up on that!
7 [2017-01-28T03:24:06] <SISheogorath> lol just saw your most and message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T11:49:39] <soapoperator> @killerspaz Thank you for the advice  I read a lot of thing without practicing. It'svery new for me. Finaly i progress faster when i face to the problem. The problem was with a volume for config.inc.ini.@SISheogorath Finaly i succeed to make phpmyadmin communicate with the container help with: [<-CODE->] But when i add another external, it doesn't work. I will try to inverse: add the phpmyadmin network to my mysql container...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T17:15:58] <galvesribeiro> is it possible to “import” a docker-compose file into another?
2 [2017-01-28T17:17:15] <galvesribeiro> I mean, I have multiple projects inside a same solution (a .Net Core application) and each project has its own docker-compose file… I want to have a solution level docker-compose file which describe all that services relationship… is it possible?
3 [2017-01-28T17:17:48] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T17:47:55] <ioleo> I'm running cassandra (official image) inside a docker. Another service (app) is in another container, and it seems the underlaying library makes a connection as soon as the service is started. That connection will fail, if there is no keyspace in cassandra, and the app will shutdown with an exception.
2 [2017-01-28T17:50:24] <ioleo> I was trying to figure out how can I make sure that as soon as cassandra starts - first thing it does is check if it has a keyspace, and if not - create it.
3 [2017-01-28T17:50:54] <ioleo> Anyone had this problem? Google & stackOverflow did not help much :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T17:58:56] <Awiu_twitter> As far as I understand this responsibility is of the App which is using Cassandra. I am also having a technology stack where my App is using Cassandra, it looks for keyspace and tables and if it's not there, it creates it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T19:34:44] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: there is a import statement in version 2.1(?) I know it is there and not working in version 3 xD
2 [2017-01-28T19:35:05] <galvesribeiro> hahahaah
3 [2017-01-28T19:35:20] <galvesribeiro> I’m playing with v3
4 [2017-01-28T19:35:39] <galvesribeiro> too much text files and command lines for us Windows users :P
5 [2017-01-28T19:36:03] <SISheogorath> In this case sry :/
6 [2017-01-28T19:36:36] <galvesribeiro> so the import isnt working on v3, it is a bug, and will be fixed, right?
7 [2017-01-28T19:37:11] <galvesribeiro> I mean, it is something that will be fixed and not something that was deprecated, correct?
8 [2017-01-28T19:38:13] <SISheogorath> Not sure. The try to keep local dependencies away from v3

13 [2017-01-28T19:42:02] <galvesribeiro> each of the inner files has only its own dependencies and itself

15 [2017-01-28T19:42:50] <SISheogorath> It'll come to v3
16 [2017-01-28T19:43:35] <galvesribeiro> ok, so today extends will not help me
17 [2017-01-28T19:43:37] <galvesribeiro> understood
18 [2017-01-28T19:46:25] <galvesribeiro> Note: This option is not yet supported when deploying a stack in swarm mode with a (version 3) Compose file. Use docker-compose config to generate a configuration with all extends options resolved, and deploy from that.

22 [2017-01-28T19:47:07] <galvesribeiro> they can extend the original ones
23 [2017-01-28T19:47:20] <galvesribeiro> it is just a diff image with a DEBUG env variable

33 [2017-01-28T20:08:15] <galvesribeiro> In all cases, I think the proper way to handle this debug/prod stuff, is by using overrides
34 [2017-01-28T20:08:17] <galvesribeiro> not extends
35 [2017-01-28T20:27:36] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: any way to conditionaly call aRUNfrom a docker file?
36 [2017-01-28T20:27:50] <galvesribeiro> I mean, without generate an extra layer
37 [2017-01-28T20:28:09] <galvesribeiro> for example, I have this:
38 [2017-01-28T20:28:17] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
39 [2017-01-28T20:28:27] <galvesribeiro> I want this to only run if I’m in debug
40 [2017-01-28T20:28:34] <galvesribeiro> today I have 2 dockerfiles
41 [2017-01-28T20:28:56] <SISheogorath> No. But you can use--squashfrom experimental to simply create it as a single layer
42 [2017-01-28T20:28:59] <galvesribeiro> if I could have just one and check if I’m in debug run this, otherwise not…
43 [2017-01-28T20:29:14] <galvesribeiro> humm
44 [2017-01-28T20:29:21] <galvesribeiro> but the caller of this docker file is a compose file
45 [2017-01-28T20:29:36] <SISheogorath> eh okay, that's bad
46 [2017-01-28T20:29:48] <galvesribeiro> I want to pass this command as a ARG
47 [2017-01-28T20:29:55] <SISheogorath> I would may simply use a--build-arg:D
48 [2017-01-28T20:30:11] <galvesribeiro> so only when I’m using the compose file that is for debug, this is passed
49 [2017-01-28T20:30:23] <SISheogorath> than it's easy :D
50 [2017-01-28T20:30:41] <galvesribeiro> Define easy :P
51 [2017-01-28T20:31:27] <SISheogorath> This: [<-CODE->]
52 [2017-01-28T20:32:11] <galvesribeiro> ok but, that will generate the extra layer for that RUN even it it doesnt run the command, right?
53 [2017-01-28T20:32:20] <galvesribeiro> or the layers are only generated on write operations?
54 [2017-01-28T20:32:25] <SISheogorath> right so it's an empty layer
55 [2017-01-28T20:32:35] <galvesribeiro> ok, I want avoid that
56 [2017-01-28T20:32:36] <galvesribeiro> :)
57 [2017-01-28T20:32:40] <SISheogorath> why?
58 [2017-01-28T20:32:59] <galvesribeiro> why do I need an empty layet in a production image? :D
59 [2017-01-28T20:33:00] <SISheogorath> as long as you stay lower than 42 layers it doesn't hurt anything ^^
60 [2017-01-28T20:33:14] <galvesribeiro> ok ok
61 [2017-01-28T20:33:15] <galvesribeiro> got it
62 [2017-01-28T20:33:32] <galvesribeiro> btw, just curious, why this cabalistical number 42?
63 [2017-01-28T20:33:35] <SISheogorath> well the other option is to maintain two images :D
64 [2017-01-28T20:34:19] <galvesribeiro> hehehe that is what I’m trying to avoid
65 [2017-01-28T20:34:20] <galvesribeiro> :)
66 [2017-01-28T20:35:11] <galvesribeiro> I can’t pass a command expression thru ARGs from a docker-compose.yml, can’t I
67 [2017-01-28T20:35:11] <galvesribeiro> ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T20:38:53] <SISheogorath> in general you shouldn't be able to build any image in docker-compose v3 anyways
2 [2017-01-28T20:39:21] <SISheogorath> reason: v3 is for distributed deployment and builds are only available locally
3 [2017-01-28T20:39:21] <galvesribeiro> oh
4 [2017-01-28T20:39:29] <galvesribeiro> ic
5 [2017-01-28T20:39:42] <galvesribeiro> So avoid build: in compose
6 [2017-01-28T20:39:43] <galvesribeiro> ic
7 [2017-01-28T20:39:55] <galvesribeiro> makes sense
8 [2017-01-28T20:40:24] <galvesribeiro> so lets keep 2 docker files instead
9 [2017-01-28T20:41:41] <galvesribeiro> but in all cases, build should be available so people can develop using it
10 [2017-01-28T20:42:09] <galvesribeiro> but I agree that the compose file for production shouldn’t have any build statements and assume the images are available in the registry
11 [2017-01-28T23:37:52] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: question for a linuxer :P
12 [2017-01-28T23:37:57] <galvesribeiro> how to make this:
13 [2017-01-28T23:38:03] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-01-28T23:38:10] <galvesribeiro> to fit in a single line?
15 [2017-01-28T23:38:28] <galvesribeiro> tried this and not work:
16 [2017-01-28T23:38:32] <galvesribeiro> "dotnet build DockerTest.sln; docker-compose build; danglingImages=$(docker images -q --filter \'dangling=true\') if [[ ! -z $danglingImages ]] then docker rmi -f $danglingImages fi"
17 [2017-01-28T23:40:36] <galvesribeiro> that way I’m calling docker twice
18 [2017-01-28T23:40:36] <galvesribeiro> :)
19 [2017-01-28T23:40:44] <galvesribeiro> it slow down the build :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-28T23:40:00] <SISheogorath> why are you do this? do [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-01-28T23:40:46] <SISheogorath> wc -l-> count lines
3 [2017-01-28T23:41:04] <galvesribeiro> yes, but docker images doesnt
4 [2017-01-28T23:41:06] <galvesribeiro> :)
5 [2017-01-28T23:41:14] <galvesribeiro> it call the API twice
6 [2017-01-28T23:41:48] <galvesribeiro> I mean, it call the API twice to check for dangling
7 [2017-01-28T23:41:52] <galvesribeiro> when it should do once
8 [2017-01-28T23:45:42] <SISheogorath> if you really want:
9 [2017-01-28T23:46:15] <galvesribeiro> it works I just tested, it just not optimal when you have tons of images dungling arount :)
10 [2017-01-28T23:46:20] <galvesribeiro> but thanks :D
11 [2017-01-28T23:46:29] <SISheogorath>  [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-01-28T23:46:49] <SISheogorath> in general with docker 1.13 the new docker system commands are better :X
13 [2017-01-28T23:48:42] <galvesribeiro> the last one didnt worked
14 [2017-01-28T23:48:50] <galvesribeiro> the dungling are there :(
15 [2017-01-28T23:48:56] <galvesribeiro> btw, I’m on 1.13
16 [2017-01-28T23:49:07] <SISheogorath> than throw the shit away xD
17 [2017-01-28T23:49:17] <galvesribeiro> ?
18 [2017-01-28T23:49:26] <galvesribeiro> what do I do then? :P
19 [2017-01-28T23:49:52] <SISheogorath> the bad scripts :D usedocker system prune
20 [2017-01-28T23:50:55] <galvesribeiro> hehehe it hang the build process with
21 [2017-01-28T23:51:02] <galvesribeiro>  [<-CODE->]
22 [2017-01-28T23:51:39] <galvesribeiro> I can’t do that… who knows if the developer has a stopped container outside this given project heheh
23 [2017-01-28T23:51:41] <SISheogorath> there is-f
24 [2017-01-28T23:51:48] <SISheogorath> did I missed to tell that? xD
25 [2017-01-28T23:52:00] <galvesribeiro> better to stick with the ugly script
26 [2017-01-28T23:52:26] <SISheogorath> as you wish ^^
27 [2017-01-28T23:52:52] <galvesribeiro> ok so what do I need do to fix the last script you pasted?
28 [2017-01-28T23:59:44] <galvesribeiro> screw that
29 [2017-01-28T23:59:49] <galvesribeiro> docker prune will be
30 [2017-01-28T23:59:58] <SISheogorath> ok
31 [2017-01-29T00:00:59] <galvesribeiro> scared
32 [2017-01-29T00:01:00] <galvesribeiro> Deleted Networks:docker_gwbridge
33 [2017-01-29T00:01:04] <galvesribeiro> it removed this network
34 [2017-01-29T00:01:20] <galvesribeiro> I never created that so I assume it is from docker4Mac o.O
35 [2017-01-29T00:01:26] <galvesribeiro> I hope it didn’t break anything

I want to be able to create and deploy a windows container running IIS ( [<-LINK->] ), then be able to access is through IIS manager remotely.  Can I do this using the default ContainerAdministrator user, or should I create a new one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T10:31:25] <jMonsinjon> Maybe Docker don\'t like your local path. Did you tried to use WORKDIR instruction before and remove the "./" prefix ?
2 [2017-01-31T10:31:46] <coding-yogi> yes
3 [2017-01-31T10:59:46] <jMonsinjon> I already had this issue....
4 [2017-01-31T11:00:17] <jMonsinjon> DId your script starts with a "shebang" ?
5 [2017-01-31T11:00:29] <jMonsinjon> like #!/bin/sh
6 [2017-01-31T11:00:56] <jMonsinjon> yep
7 [2017-01-31T11:01:21] <jMonsinjon> it happends to me when i forget to add the shebang
8 [2017-01-31T11:03:28] <jMonsinjon> the #!/bin/bash doesn't work in alpine (if you use an alpine base image)

3 [2017-01-31T11:55:31] <elcolie> My question is "How to use Django container connect to host postgres?"
4 [2017-01-31T11:56:17] <elcolie> I had configure the host-postgres to accept all the connection and let container connect to host-postgres by this line [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T13:48:11] <SISheogorath> DJQTDJ: I guess you picked the wrong channel. That's an HTTP CORS violation. Check for CORS in you favorite search engine.
2 [2017-01-31T13:51:35] <SISheogorath> aniket-21: Alpine has no bash installed. You can maybe add it byapk add --no-cache bashbut in general that sounds bad. Write  the script to work with/bin/sh
3 [2017-01-31T13:53:08] <jMonsinjon> aniket-21: @SISheogorathagree, that's why I asked what was the basic image used

1 [2017-01-31T14:09:55] <argeas> argeas: hi all . i have 2 android devices..  I start the container like this  docker run -d --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --name auto1 appium/appium-project-base:latesti can see both devices..but second container cant either device
2 [2017-01-31T14:13:26] <dragon788> aniket-21: if you runwhich bashin your container it should return the correct path to bash if it is in your PATH, if not check/usr/bin/bash
3 [2017-01-31T14:14:48] <dragon788> I don't know if Alpine includesenvbut you could also try#! /usr/bin/env bashwhich looks for it automatically
4 [2017-01-31T14:15:36] <coding-yogi> Bash is not a prob, i tried running some other commands and they work
5 [2017-01-31T14:15:59] <coding-yogi> Problem is my file has windows new line char and hence causing problem
6 [2017-01-31T14:16:27] <coding-yogi> ^M denotes that
7 [2017-01-31T14:16:33] <dragon788> Ah, using notepad++ or vim is a good way to fix that
8 [2017-01-31T14:16:50] <coding-yogi> Yeah
9 [2017-01-31T14:17:42] <dragon788> I'm so used to reading past the ^M I didn't notice it, bash definitely cares though

1 [2017-01-31T14:53:59] <iDVB> anyone know of a workflow to successfully usenpm linkwhile developing in a docker container? Eg. I'd like to setup a link inside the docker node_modules folder that is able to link to the host machine custommodule that I'm developing
2 [2017-01-31T15:04:57] <iDVB> SISheogorath: yup, guess that is what I'll have to do. Just seems dirty. Liked the idea that usingnpm linklocally (not in docker) didn't make ANY changes to the source files, yet let you dev that module.
3 [2017-01-31T15:15:54] <iDVB> SISheogorath: can you provide a sample command for mounting on startup?
4 [2017-01-31T15:16:50] <iDVB> Guess I'm getting caught up on the fact that the containers node_modules folder will already contain the public module and not the symlink
5 [2017-01-31T16:06:38] <iDVB> Really struggling with this. can't seem to get it to work
6 [2017-01-31T16:07:31] <iDVB>  [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-01-31T16:08:31] <iDVB> the react-player module is failing on launch saying it can't find the deps.Error: Cannot resolve module 'react' in /deps/react-player/lib/players
8 [2017-01-31T16:19:31] <iDVB> well... its definitly a combo... since this works fine withoutnpm link
9 [2017-01-31T16:20:27] <iDVB> near pulling my hair out though. Since I need to get on with module dev but docker at this moment is more of an obstacle would love to understand how to get this to work.
10 [2017-01-31T16:20:55] <iDVB> in my head.... I just need to add the volume (docker-compose in my case )- ./../react-player:/deps/react-player
11 [2017-01-31T16:21:49] <iDVB> which maps the host's local git clone of the react-player module then mapping it over to a folder that the container can ref
12 [2017-01-31T16:22:43] <iDVB> then I try to link that container's folder ...
13 [2017-01-31T16:22:53] <iDVB>  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T15:02:51] <SISheogorath> iDVB: copy it into the container and usenpm linkas usual?
2 [2017-01-31T15:06:30] <SISheogorath> or mount it on container startup
3 [2017-01-31T15:48:49] <SISheogorath> Oh yes that's possible. Never tried but using-v /path/to/module:/lokal-moduleand runnpm linkin entrypoint script maybe works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T16:11:45] <killerspaz> galvesribeiro: @SISheogorathbtw, that dangling alias is useless with 1.13... [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-01-31T16:12:08] <galvesribeiro> yeah I’m using prune now
3 [2017-01-31T16:12:32] <galvesribeiro> I’m just afraid that it may remove stopped containers in the developer machine that it isn’t suppose to
4 [2017-01-31T16:12:34] <galvesribeiro> anyway
5 [2017-01-31T16:12:58] <killerspaz> well it's a development machine, it's meant to break :P
6 [2017-01-31T16:13:09] <galvesribeiro> hahahah
7 [2017-01-31T16:13:12] <killerspaz> i assume all development to be stateless while i work in containers
8 [2017-01-31T16:13:12] <galvesribeiro> true
9 [2017-01-31T16:13:19] <galvesribeiro> yes it is
10 [2017-01-31T16:13:37] <killerspaz> i run purge like 40x a day :P
11 [2017-01-31T16:14:00] <galvesribeiro> in my case it run every time I build the .net project :P
12 [2017-01-31T16:14:18] <galvesribeiro> actually not anymore...
13 [2017-01-31T16:14:22] <galvesribeiro> I just made a volume
14 [2017-01-31T16:14:28] <galvesribeiro> pointing to the build output
15 [2017-01-31T16:14:40] <galvesribeiro> now Idocker-compose up -donce
16 [2017-01-31T16:14:45] <galvesribeiro> and keep the containers running
17 [2017-01-31T16:14:57] <galvesribeiro> the entrypoint istail -f /dev/null
18 [2017-01-31T16:15:04] <galvesribeiro> so it keep up forever
19 [2017-01-31T16:15:17] <galvesribeiro> and my tooling is starting the debugger and the app viadocker exec
20 [2017-01-31T16:15:44] <galvesribeiro> so if I stop debug, it close the debugger process… so just need to run again :)
21 [2017-01-31T16:15:50] <galvesribeiro> the cycle got easy now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T16:18:57] <SISheogorath> iDVB: sounds more like a problem with your dependencies than with docker itself
2 [2017-01-31T16:23:13] <SISheogorath> File permissions?yarn install -fmaybe ignores the problem that it possibly has no write permissions to the module directory
3 [2017-01-31T16:23:32] <iDVB> yup.... tried that andyarn upgrade
4 [2017-01-31T16:23:55] <iDVB> :( thought for sure someone had a workflow for this
5 [2017-01-31T16:24:36] <SISheogorath> I personally prefer Dockerfiles in my repos and copy everything in
6 [2017-01-31T16:24:49] <iDVB> or is there just a way to get COPY docker command to support symlinks
7 [2017-01-31T16:25:17] <iDVB> going to try the dockerfile next
8 [2017-01-31T16:26:18] <SISheogorath> O.o if you copy Symlinks you have pointers to dead endpoint if you don't copy the target to the correct location, too
9 [2017-01-31T16:27:07] <iDVB> sorry.... not following
10 [2017-01-31T16:27:34] <iDVB> I would just expect it to copy over the result of following the symlink
11 [2017-01-31T16:32:19] <killerspaz> Usinglinkin that context is super strange.... Highly suggested to avoid that like the plague.
12 [2017-01-31T16:32:32] <killerspaz> You should actually commit it as a module and define it as a dependency in yourpackage.jsonproperly
13 [2017-01-31T16:32:49] <killerspaz> also, depending on your environment, links do not work (esp with virtualbox)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T16:34:39] <iDVB> killerspaz: npm link/yarn linkis a very typical module dev workflow. It allows you to develop a specific module while in the context of a larger app without having to add/commit/push/yarn upgrade each time you make a single line change to the component.
2 [2017-01-31T16:35:27] <iDVB> for us... it might be a docker-for-dev show stopper if there isnt a work around.
3 [2017-01-31T16:35:58] <iDVB> I just tried making the changes to the dockerfile and gotERROR: Service 'web' failed to build: Forbidden path outside the build context: ../react-player ()
4 [2017-01-31T16:35:59] <killerspaz> DEV workflow, not deployment, which is what docker is, a deployment mechanism
5 [2017-01-31T16:36:25] <killerspaz> I know precisely what linking modules does
6 [2017-01-31T16:37:27] <killerspaz> This is also a "won\'t fix" on both docker and virtualbox\'s issue lists
7 [2017-01-31T16:37:29] <iDVB> killerspaz: I sense an abstract debate.... but is it not fair to say that people use docker as their dev workflow? so rather then deving on the host... you instead dev in docker? This is what we've been doing for a few months now... successfully too, this has been the first road block.
8 [2017-01-31T16:38:16] <killerspaz> you've been doing it locally only, it's not feasible in docker as it's not a best practice to deploy a dev workflow
9 [2017-01-31T16:39:19] <killerspaz> the other issue about the build context means you can't include anything above your build folder
10 [2017-01-31T16:40:20] <iDVB> no I mean in response to your"DEV workflow, not deployment, which is what docker is, a deployment mechanism"we\'ve been using docker as our dev workflow.... the only piece of that typical workflow is the linking of modules.
11 [2017-01-31T16:40:47] <SISheogorath> What makes no sense to me is that you build from directoryA while developing directoryB.
12 [2017-01-31T16:41:26] <killerspaz> eh, that part can make sense.... chicken or the egg issue with dependencies
13 [2017-01-31T16:41:27] <iDVB> wait.... what are we debating here.... docker-for-dev or docker+npmlink ?
14 [2017-01-31T16:41:48] <killerspaz> you start working on something, then realize you can abstract some logic, then your main work involves iterating a dependency
15 [2017-01-31T16:42:13] <SISheogorath> You can work around your issue by running you container as the same user as you normal user and use yarn install to relink your dependencies but be aware of the possibility that this breaks your local dependencies
16 [2017-01-31T16:43:20] <iDVB> SISheogorath: that sounds hopeful.... just not sure what it means in application
17 [2017-01-31T16:44:16] <killerspaz> first, what environment are you@iDVB
18 [2017-01-31T16:44:41] <SISheogorath> Not sure what platform you're on :D try-u $(whoami)with docker run
19 [2017-01-31T16:44:46] <iDVB> Anyway@killerspazdon't shatter my perspective of docker. :D so far things have been REALLY great as the dev workflow.... even got it pushing blue/green deploys to AWS EB (prod) so we are so far very happy
20 [2017-01-31T16:45:03] <iDVB> host or container env?
21 [2017-01-31T16:45:06] <killerspaz> host
22 [2017-01-31T16:45:11] <iDVB> macOS
23 [2017-01-31T16:45:14] <killerspaz> this is actually a virtualbox issue, not docker
24 [2017-01-31T16:45:30] <killerspaz> yeah, so virtualbox on windows NOR osx support links
25 [2017-01-31T16:45:36] <killerspaz> from the host fs
26 [2017-01-31T16:45:57] <killerspaz> been an issue for about 6 years now
27 [2017-01-31T16:46:02] <iDVB> killerspaz: I need to read up more on that .... was not aware that vbox was used at all under the covers of docker.
28 [2017-01-31T16:47:00] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: docker4mac shouldn't use virtualbox anymore, should it?
29 [2017-01-31T16:47:05] <killerspaz> ??? it's part of the install to install vbox if it's not on your system
30 [2017-01-31T16:47:07] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
31 [2017-01-31T16:47:29] <iDVB> complete miss on my part... but coincidentally ran into this topic last night.  We're someone was saying that--net=hostalso does not work on macOS host and that you have to explicitly declare the ports with-p port:port
32 [2017-01-31T16:47:33] <killerspaz> oh well i suppose that's the key, was Docker Toolbox used?
33 [2017-01-31T16:48:52] <iDVB> With Docker for Mac, you have a new, native virtualization system running (HyperKit) which takes the place of the VirtualBox system.
34 [2017-01-31T16:49:22] <iDVB> sounds to me like vbox is not a dep? I DO have vbox installed though... just was not aware it was using it.
35 [2017-01-31T16:50:37] <killerspaz> did you use Docker for Mac, or DockerToolbox to install?
36 [2017-01-31T16:50:43] <killerspaz> easy test would bedocker-machine ls
37 [2017-01-31T16:50:55] <killerspaz> if it comes up at all, you have toolbox installed
38 [2017-01-31T16:51:35] <iDVB> I have it installed
39 [2017-01-31T16:51:49] <iDVB> does that mean I'm oldschool or newschool
40 [2017-01-31T16:51:51] <iDVB> :P
41 [2017-01-31T16:52:42] <killerspaz> i'm still using docker toolbox myself, so i guess we're both oldschool
42 [2017-01-31T16:53:15] <killerspaz> last i tried native docker it was too much a PITA to get running, so i'm just letting them iron out all the major issues first
43 [2017-01-31T16:54:12] <iDVB> ya I thought I heard there was some kinda update recently
44 [2017-01-31T16:55:53] <iDVB> anyway... it sounds like others have gotten a work around working... [<-LINK->] it's just its pushing my understanding of docker.
45 [2017-01-31T16:56:41] <iDVB> also... he's further complicating things by using Vagrant. :P
46 [2017-01-31T16:58:58] <killerspaz> the only workaround i know is to manually symlink them
47 [2017-01-31T17:06:51] <iDVB> killerspaz: in application... how do I do that? I thought I had tried everything :P
48 [2017-01-31T17:07:56] <iDVB> SISheogorath: ha. Use the tool for the job. Didn't know Sketch and Photoshop work on Linux. ;)
49 [2017-01-31T17:08:53] <dragon788> he's saying run a Vagrant box that is Linux and do your Docker fun inside that :P
50 [2017-01-31T17:09:04] <dragon788> aka boot2docker phat style :)
51 [2017-01-31T17:09:29] <iDVB> ah... simlar to what this dude is doing I guess.... [<-LINK->]
52 [2017-01-31T17:09:47] <iDVB> which may be a requirement to get this workflow working
53 [2017-01-31T17:09:48] <dragon788> the other advantage is that Vagrant provides another isolation layer, so you aren't doing un-reproducible stuff on your host+Docker that you can't perform on another machine
54 [2017-01-31T17:10:20] <iDVB> fair nuff..... thats my newb showing...... I thought I was doing that by using docker in the first place
55 [2017-01-31T17:10:21] <iDVB> :D
56 [2017-01-31T17:10:33] <iDVB> makes sense now though
57 [2017-01-31T17:11:11] <dragon788> yeah, that's a pretty good start, it's a bit complex, but one thing I found with node is the stupid depth and magic symlinking they do always ends poorly on Windows, and trying to manage your code outside of Vagrant and sharing it in using a shared folder is a recipe for pain
58 [2017-01-31T17:12:31] <dragon788> yeah, Docker gives you some isolation, but especially on anything but Linux, you are using additional layers of abstraction you don\'t know about (boot2docker/Virtualbox) that makes troubleshooting and the basic "link"/"expose" stuff tricky to debug
59 [2017-01-31T17:12:47] <SISheogorath> iDVB: If you really want everything works on linux :D :D :D
60 [2017-01-31T17:13:19] <dragon788> if you do it in a Vagrant box you have a simple entrypoint that works on ANY system the same way, and then you can use Docker in Linux via the Vagrant box, which keeps things very consistent
61 [2017-01-31T17:13:38] <SISheogorath> best example: Wine for Microsoft Office :D Don't know why people do that but there are people doing that :D
62 [2017-01-31T17:16:26] <dragon788> sometimes you just need that one stupid proprietaryFLOOR()function that OpenOffice might not have yet :P
63 [2017-01-31T17:16:47] <dragon788> I bought a license for CrossOver Office quite a while ago when it was cheap, still haven't gotten around to using it yet
64 [2017-01-31T17:19:17] <dragon788> if you really want a mind blowing trip, check out Jess Frizzel's (sp?)  dotfiles repository, she operates almost completely within Docker, she's using a Docker container for Firefox, for Mutt, for IRC, pretty much anything that can be shoved into a container and shared to a host session she has done so, gives an ultimate portable experience, and she even has a SICK alias that looks for a binary locally, if it can't find it then it checks the namespace to see if there is a Docker container for that command and pulls it down, otherwise it returns 'command not found'
65 [2017-01-31T17:19:58] <SISheogorath> Today I am nearly convinced that there is no need for most non-console software on a machine anyways. Simply caused by the fact that everything else is able to run in a webbrowser today. Nearly every usecase already has an electron/webapp :D
66 [2017-01-31T17:21:51] <SISheogorath> Hyper is the best example :D A terminal emulator in as electron app :D So lovely
67 [2017-01-31T17:24:15] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure if docker is the solution for everything :D But her dotfiles look interesting :D
68 [2017-01-31T21:19:35] <dragon788> if you rundocker stop <containerid>they should persist if you start them again, but any time you rundocker run <imagename>it will typically create a new container
69 [2017-01-31T21:23:53] <SISheogorath> phonoloop_twitter: currently not possible explicit by Dockerfile ordocker build. You can maybe load it like in a usual shellscript in your run part.
70 [2017-01-31T21:24:32] <phonoloop_twitter> ok, thank you
71 [2017-01-31T21:24:46] <SISheogorath> you're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T16:58:31] <SISheogorath> You mac guys... :D Running Docker in linux is so simple, works out of the box and has no problems with anything :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T17:32:34] <sbromberger> hi all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T17:33:11] <sbromberger> I have a really stupid docker question. I had to reinstall docker on my mac, and now my ubuntu images don’t persist any of the apt-get updates I run in the container. Did something change? How do I get back “persistent” containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T21:19:45] <phonoloop_twitter> Anyone knows how to load a .env file inside a docker file? I would like to use some data from that file to complete my build.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-31T23:41:35] <N0bl3> Hello docker community, i have trouble setting it up with webstorm am i in the right place? :)
2 [2017-01-31T23:42:48] <SISheogorath> In general the docker community is may not the right place to discuss problems of a JavaScript IDE :D
3 [2017-01-31T23:43:11] <SISheogorath> but if you have a problem with docker and webstorm working together we maybe can help
4 [2017-01-31T23:44:33] <SISheogorath> In general the best way to get an answer is asking the explicit question. I can also recommend: [<-LINK->] Which explains in detail the best way to get answers in IRC Channels, Forums and other community driven platforms
5 [2017-01-31T23:51:48] <N0bl3> SISheogorath: well ... i was able to find that this is directly to webstorm as in powershell all works fine :) So thank you anyway :D
6 [2017-01-31T23:52:07] <SISheogorath> you're welcome
7 [2017-02-01T04:51:49] <SISheogorath> in your container you have to use you database container name/link-alias to connect to it. (in your casedatabase) instead of local host.
8 [2017-02-01T04:52:22] <SISheogorath> Containers don't have the loopback ports of your host environment
9 [2017-02-01T04:52:50] <SISheogorath> as they have their ownlodevice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T04:35:03] <raul782> hi guys, I’ve been using docker-compose to build my local stack [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-02-01T04:35:52] <raul782> The issue is that my apache server can’t connect to my redis server
3 [2017-02-01T04:36:12] <raul782> when It tries to connect through  localhost:6379
4 [2017-02-01T04:36:21] <raul782> Is there something that I’m missing
5 [2017-02-01T04:36:40] <raul782> I’ve checked my /etc/hosts and the only reference is the web server ips
6 [2017-02-01T04:36:44] <raul782> and container id
7 [2017-02-01T04:36:48] <raul782> I’m using docker 1.13
8 [2017-02-01T04:37:37] <raul782> What is strange is that I can connect to my database through localhost:3306
9 [2017-02-01T05:30:47] <raul782> SISheogorath: thanks, you were right I needed to use redis on apache, you made my day :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T05:27:01] <patsissons> dockerfile question, if my base image defines a volume, is it just redundant to also define the same volume?
2 [2017-02-01T07:01:47] <patsissons> gadget_mnky_twitter: thanks, that was my suspicion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T05:56:52] <gadget_mnky_twitter> patsissons: do you really need to define it? Most of the host mounted volumes are usually -v and done iirc
2 [2017-02-01T05:57:07] <gadget_mnky_twitter> To answer your question specifically, it is redundant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T06:40:18] <soapoperator> hello, i use docker-compose to run some container (wordpress for exemple), do you have a clever solution to deal with the permission issue: volumes use ww-data:www-data.I try to adduser :"1000:1000"but it get a connexion error.The only solution i find is to add my usr to www-data group thenchmodthe folder. But it\'s not very elegant and a n arg in docker-compose could be more consistent.
2 [2017-02-01T06:41:06] <gadget_mnky_twitter> that sounds a bit off
3 [2017-02-01T06:41:10] <gadget_mnky_twitter> odd*
4 [2017-02-01T06:41:12] <gadget_mnky_twitter> could you elaborate a tad more
5 [2017-02-01T06:41:29] <gadget_mnky_twitter> on how you are running the container? and where is the folder ?
6 [2017-02-01T06:48:29] <soapoperator> @gadget_mnky_twitter for exemple, i run the file: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-02-01T06:50:39] <soapoperator> But i try to install directly in another container apache + mariadb + php but i get an 500 error during the install... And i suspect the container user don't have right to copy and edit wp-config file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T07:16:09] <coding-yogi> Does docker-compose up also build the image?
2 [2017-02-01T07:16:29] <coding-yogi> or i explicitly need to build and then run up
3 [2017-02-01T07:17:01] <coding-yogi> also is run only used to start a single docker container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T08:10:38] <ahmadiq> @aniket-21 docker-compose up will build the image if it doesn't exist already.after that it will run without rebuild the image unless run with --build optiondocker-compose run is used to execute a one-time command in one of the services  configured in the docker-compose file
2 [2017-02-01T08:11:46] <coding-yogi> thanks@ahmadiq
3 [2017-02-01T08:12:26] <coding-yogi> I have a docker compose file where I am creating an image for my microservice and also it needs a rabbitmq image..so I have both in compose file
4 [2017-02-01T08:13:00] <coding-yogi> now before I bring up the containers, can i run a command with "run" in rabbitmq image?>
5 [2017-02-01T08:16:23] <ahmadiq> it will execute the command in the container one time, but if the service has links,  it will start those containers as well, but probably wont stop them i think
6 [2017-02-01T08:17:12] <ahmadiq> what kind of command are you trying to run in the rabbitmq image btw.there may be an easier way of what you're trying to accomplish
7 [2017-02-01T08:17:57] <coding-yogi> just a work around for now, microservice is expecting one exchange to be available and its not creating the same if its not available
8 [2017-02-01T08:18:08] <coding-yogi> this needs a code fix on microservice side
9 [2017-02-01T08:18:29] <coding-yogi> but as a workaround, I wish to use rabbitmq commandline to create that exchange
10 [2017-02-01T08:18:44] <coding-yogi> before my microservice starts
11 [2017-02-01T08:22:14] <ahmadiq> perhaps you can use thecommandoption in the compose file to specify the command to run in the rabbitmq container, and specifydepends_onoption in the other service so that the rabbitmq container always starts before the other one
12 [2017-02-01T08:23:38] <coding-yogi> but it says it overrides default command
13 [2017-02-01T08:24:09] <coding-yogi> does that mean it overrides CMD from Dockerfile?
14 [2017-02-01T08:24:21] <gadget_mnky_twitter> yes
15 [2017-02-01T08:24:37] <gadget_mnky_twitter> if compose has a separate command specified, the one in Dockerfile will be overridden.
16 [2017-02-01T08:24:44] <gadget_mnky_twitter> rule of thumb: There is always 1 command that is executed
17 [2017-02-01T08:25:07] <coding-yogi> yep, that's why I am not using that
18 [2017-02-01T08:25:26] <coding-yogi> cos default command starts the rabbitmq server
19 [2017-02-01T08:25:40] <gadget_mnky_twitter> you can always add to that in your dockerfile using &&
20 [2017-02-01T08:25:47] <gadget_mnky_twitter> though it may not be the best thing to do
21 [2017-02-01T08:28:39] <coding-yogi> that can be one of the options
22 [2017-02-01T10:22:14] <gadget_mnky_twitter> that should be just fine
23 [2017-02-01T10:22:40] <gadget_mnky_twitter> if you are building a service at runtime using compose, you can also use reload/restart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T09:03:38] <pkariz> hi, i have docker-compose.yml which starts 4 containers (all needed always). Whats the \'sequence\' i should use for development? im thinking "docker-compose up" and "docker-compose down" after i finish...is that ok?
2 [2017-02-01T11:51:25] <pkariz> ok ty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T18:29:54] <anand79> Hi I am new to docker. When I do docker run hello-world in windows 7 where does the image files get copied to?
2 [2017-02-01T18:33:10] <anand79> I downloaded docker toolbox and running it from the docker terminal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T19:14:31] <leon> Hi! I’m playing around with docker and spring boot.Spring boot apps get built with gradle and outputs a fat jar.But when I want to deploy said fat jar, I only need the JRE, not the JDK.What are the best practices when it comes to apps that need a build step, such as angular-cli apps, spring boot apps?
2 [2017-02-01T19:15:45] <leon> I want to be able to use the docker cloud auto build / test features to build my spring boot apps, and my angular apps, but then take the output of the build and store it in another image which only contains the artifacts from the first build
3 [2017-02-01T19:16:06] <leon> which is optimized for runtime
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T19:18:55] <SISheogorath> Why ship the output around? Simply build it and keep it in your image. Install all build dependencies, build your app and delete the dependencies and unnecessary packages/libraries/etc.
2 [2017-02-01T19:19:35] <SISheogorath> But if you really want use a buildhook for it and do crazy things
3 [2017-02-01T19:28:05] <SISheogorath> leon: But I also know some people who try to avoid a rebuild in the docker image so they simply install their build artifacts to the container and start them
4 [2017-02-01T19:29:47] <leon> Since I’m thinking about using docker cloud to do continuous deployment, it would be best if everything was build and tested by docker cloud
5 [2017-02-01T19:30:01] <leon> if this is a pipe dream or not time will have to tell
6 [2017-02-01T19:31:19] <leon> I’ve been using gradle’s docker plugin to build and push images which workes great, so I could still use that for deployment, but use docker cloud’s auto test feature to run the gradle tests on git pushes and pull requests
7 [2017-02-02T01:38:32] <SISheogorath> @robdoesstuff if you can share some run statements, sure we will have some ideas. [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-01T22:35:58] <Vernuft123> Hi, im using kitematic and downloaded an image. Its started up and i can see the IP. I also have Virtual Box Boot 2 Dock running.
2 [2017-02-01T22:36:04] <Vernuft123> How can i acces this image?
3 [2017-02-01T22:36:26] <Vernuft123> I tried [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-02-01T22:46:23] <Vernuft123> i can also ping it 192.168.99.100:32768
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-02T00:41:45] <dragon788> is the image setup with an "EXPOSE" or can you supply that as part of your run command?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-02T01:02:22] <robdoesstuff> Hi Guys, I'm super frustrated with a really basic networking issue and am wondering if anyone could shed some light on this. It's really pretty simple: I have a little webserver (karma) that runs on port 9876, and it spawns another process (phantomjs) which connects to port 9876 and runs the tests. None of this is to be exposed or externally mapped. All I need is karma binding to 0.0.0.0:9876 and phantomjs to connect to <whateverinterface>:9876. The problem is that this doesn't seem to work at all in Docker 1.12 or 1.13 on Linux or OSX. Any ideas?
2 [2017-02-02T03:02:36] <robdoesstuff> Same container. You can test this with any container which has any port.
3 [2017-02-02T03:02:55] <robdoesstuff> just run your container and then exec -t -i <container> sh
4 [2017-02-02T03:03:07] <SISheogorath> and what did you run there?
5 [2017-02-02T03:03:08] <robdoesstuff> an in the shell, do netstat -ln to see what ports it is listening on internally
6 [2017-02-02T03:03:32] <robdoesstuff> and then try to telnet to localhost or the container internal ip at the port and see if you establish a connection
7 [2017-02-02T03:03:42] <robdoesstuff> Sorry, what do you mean what did I run there?
8 [2017-02-02T03:03:47] <robdoesstuff> "docker run <container>"
9 [2017-02-02T03:04:32] <robdoesstuff> Steps are: 1) Run container. 2) Go into shell inside container. 3) Try to connect to any internal service port.
10 [2017-02-02T03:04:35] <SISheogorath> I know it works because I have done that mutiple times ._. That's howHEALTHCHECKs work
11 [2017-02-02T03:04:48] <robdoesstuff> really?
12 [2017-02-02T03:05:01] <robdoesstuff> I spent 4 hours today trying this every which way
13 [2017-02-02T03:05:18] <robdoesstuff> I can access the port externally from outside the container when I map it (-p port:port)
14 [2017-02-02T03:05:42] <robdoesstuff> so I can connect my host browser into karma running in the container like that
15 [2017-02-02T03:05:43] <SISheogorath> trydocker run -d --name inspircd inspircd/inspircd-docker && docker exec -it inspircd telnet 127.0.0.1 6667
16 [2017-02-02T03:05:45] <robdoesstuff> but that's really not the objective :)
17 [2017-02-02T03:06:00] <robdoesstuff> let me check that out.
18 [2017-02-02T03:07:06] <robdoesstuff> wtf
19 [2017-02-02T03:07:17] <SISheogorath> not sure thattelnetexists in the container :D if case it doesn't you can also runnc:D
20 [2017-02-02T03:07:30] <robdoesstuff> right I was using alpine so didn't have nc
21 [2017-02-02T03:07:41] <robdoesstuff> Ok so I see a difference
22 [2017-02-02T03:07:43] <robdoesstuff> I'll show you.
23 [2017-02-02T03:07:47] <robdoesstuff> btw it does work right there
24 [2017-02-02T03:07:58] <robdoesstuff> telnet localhost 6667 from inside the container connected and jumped into ident
25 [2017-02-02T03:09:56] <robdoesstuff> Here is the netstat from the working container:
26 [2017-02-02T03:09:58] <robdoesstuff> tcp        0      0 :::6667                 :::*                    LISTEN
27 [2017-02-02T03:10:02] <robdoesstuff> and from the non-working one:
28 [2017-02-02T03:10:13] <robdoesstuff> tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9876            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
29 [2017-02-02T03:10:24] <robdoesstuff> So apparently you must bind to IPv6
30 [2017-02-02T03:10:31] <robdoesstuff> in order for ip4 to work...
31 [2017-02-02T03:10:33] <robdoesstuff> :(
32 [2017-02-02T03:10:44] <robdoesstuff> Sounds like a familiar bug
33 [2017-02-02T03:10:48] <SISheogorath> not sure. can you share the container?
34 [2017-02-02T03:10:54] <robdoesstuff> I can't unfortunately, private repo
35 [2017-02-02T03:11:00] <SISheogorath> I see, no problem
36 [2017-02-02T03:11:00] <robdoesstuff> let's see
37 [2017-02-02T03:11:19] <robdoesstuff> yeah there isn't a super fast way for me to share that
38 [2017-02-02T03:12:37] <robdoesstuff> Can I see your dockerfile?

43 [2017-02-02T03:14:32] <robdoesstuff> I came across a similar one today for building phantomjs
44 [2017-02-02T03:14:37] <robdoesstuff> yeah alpine has been working great for us
45 [2017-02-02T03:14:47] <robdoesstuff> other than the issue I'm having right now
46 [2017-02-02T03:15:08] <SISheogorath> phantomjs on alpine is a bit unperfect
47 [2017-02-02T03:15:19] <robdoesstuff> I'm thinking of making a new base layer which is node alpine w/headless browser for running tests
48 [2017-02-02T03:15:24] <robdoesstuff> why unperfect?
49 [2017-02-02T03:15:39] <robdoesstuff> the bin hardly added any footprint
50 [2017-02-02T03:17:16] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] <-- working to fix their phantomJS setup but currently still broken :/
51 [2017-02-02T03:17:58] <robdoesstuff> oh I found a totally different way to do that today that worked for me
52 [2017-02-02T03:18:12] <robdoesstuff> well first of all there is a prebuilt version we're using now that's in an npm
53 [2017-02-02T03:18:15] <SISheogorath> share it?
54 [2017-02-02T03:18:28] <robdoesstuff> but I found this run command to build it on alpine and delete all the deps, leaving just the bin
55 [2017-02-02T03:18:31] <robdoesstuff> yeah finding..
56 [2017-02-02T03:18:53] <robdoesstuff>  [<-LINK->]
57 [2017-02-02T03:22:39] <robdoesstuff> Ugh, perhaps this was a red herring
58 [2017-02-02T03:22:44] <robdoesstuff> Here's my new netstat -ln
59 [2017-02-02T03:22:47] <robdoesstuff> tcp        0      0 :::9876                 :::*                    LISTEN
60 [2017-02-02T03:22:53] <robdoesstuff> and I still can't establish connection...
61 [2017-02-02T03:27:33] <robdoesstuff> I'm wondering if there's something about the incoming connection that makes node.js freeze and not establish?
62 [2017-02-02T03:42:24] <SISheogorath> not sure as mentioned I had some crazy problems with phantomJS on alpine not sure if it is involved here

1 [2017-02-02T13:35:16] <argeas> hi all:I am trying to start a container and have it see a specific device(phone) is it possible instead of : docker run -d  -t -i --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/066 .   to use the device serial number? at the docker run command ?
2 [2017-02-02T14:18:34] <argeas> dragon788: thought the same.. thanks !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-02T14:04:00] <dragon788> it probably can't see the device's serial number with that USB access, what you'd need to do is a pre-script that queries the serial number on the host side and resolves it to the correct USB bus and passes that into the run command

1 [2017-02-02T19:17:58] <austinfrey> is there any downtime to currently running services when running astack updateto  add a new service to the stack?
2 [2017-02-02T19:19:01] <killerspaz> i'd assume existing connections will yield to their TTL while new ones are routed to the new container instances
3 [2017-02-02T19:21:19] <austinfrey> so you'd guess that only changes would be implemented, current services would be untouched.  just wasn't sure if it essentially stops the current stack and starts everything all at once with the new stack config or just looks for changes in the config and implements those
4 [2017-02-02T19:21:20] <austinfrey> thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-02T21:07:11] <SISheogorath> currently docker starts the new service, waits until it's healthy and once that's done it stops the old instance or stops the update process

1 [2017-02-03T04:28:45] <ely029> hey gang how to setup a database in dockerized mssql server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-03T04:28:59] <gadget_mnky_twitter> ely029: could you be more specific ?
2 [2017-02-03T04:29:21] <gadget_mnky_twitter> you can mount a set of sql files in a given location and those would be executed when you start the container
3 [2017-02-03T04:29:27] <gadget_mnky_twitter> official documentation provides that
4 [2017-02-03T04:29:54] <ely029> Awww I will set it up in volume in yaml file
5 [2017-02-03T04:30:04] <gadget_mnky_twitter> yeps
6 [2017-02-03T04:30:15] <ely029> damn haha I just a beginner
7 [2017-02-03T04:30:16] <gadget_mnky_twitter> just mount the volume with .sql files and map it to entrypoint folder
8 [2017-02-03T04:30:18] <gadget_mnky_twitter> that’s all
9 [2017-02-03T04:30:47] <ely029> How to test it if the database is created?
10 [2017-02-03T04:30:57] <gadget_mnky_twitter> or trace logs
11 [2017-02-03T04:30:59] <gadget_mnky_twitter> just login :)
12 [2017-02-03T04:31:38] <ely029> docker run -it?
13 [2017-02-03T04:31:45] <ely029> in the container?
14 [2017-02-03T04:31:55] <gadget_mnky_twitter> if you are exposing the mysql port to host, just directly run mysql and connect
15 [2017-02-03T04:32:14] <gadget_mnky_twitter> or you can do a docker logs -f <ID> and you will see if those files are picked up and executed; or not
16 [2017-02-03T04:33:11] <ely029> <ip>:<port> i just run it on the browser?
17 [2017-02-03T04:33:26] <gadget_mnky_twitter> command line login for mysql?

1 [2017-02-03T08:53:59] <4406arthur> Hi all,I wonder that  the lantency  in swarm replicated services model ,if  I set redis replica = 3,  the state of them always keep same ?
2 [2017-02-03T09:47:47] <4406arthur> you are right, but I didn’t setup redis cluster config, swarm mode also sync it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-03T09:32:23] <SISheogorath> what type of state are you talking about? docker doesn't manage the memory and process management of the application. If you run redis and scale it up to 3 swarm makes sure that there are always 3 redis instances running. How they kept in sync is your/the applications problem
2 [2017-02-06T00:59:27] <SISheogorath> egyptianpharoh: if you rely on docker and have no time to fix everything yourself I really recommend you Docker CS. To your actual problem I can't really help you with it as there are tons of information missing like that you did before, what you did when it caused and what work arounds you are talking about. But as this is a chat it's not the right place for all this information. Maybe open an Thread on [<-LINK->] or on Stack Overflow.
3 [2017-02-06T01:08:05] <SISheogorath> LuisUrrutia: Dockerfile is something like a makefile for Docker images. So it runs ondocker buildin case you usedocker runand the image has information about an "entrypoint script" it runs the entrypoint script withCMDas parameter (in case you don\'t specify anything else after the image name in you run statement). If there is no entrypoint script specified it runs theCMDstatement directly. Here we depend on your way to specify it. In case you writeCMD "./somecommand arg1 arg2"it\'ll call the specified command with the defined default shell (in regular/bin/sh -c). In case you use the array notation (CMD ["somecommand", "arg1", "arg2"]) it calls the command directly without the shell.

1 [2017-02-03T20:42:32] <killerspaz> Hopefully a quick question... Running Win10, Docker Toolbox, rancheros as docker-machine, and trying to volume mount/dev:/devi get\\dev: "\\\\dev" includes invalid characters for a local volume name, only "[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]" are allowedWHYYYY??
2 [2017-02-03T21:41:31] <killerspaz> but shouldn't it use the the  VM as the host fs?
3 [2017-02-03T22:30:18] <killerspaz> no, i'm not on win10 pro
4 [2017-02-04T00:40:29] <killerspaz> did you docker login?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-03T21:18:27] <dragon788> on a Linux guest /dev might be valid, but on Windows that wouldn't fly without a drive specification, and it looks like it is auto escaping possibly which could make the path look like a network share instead of a local drive, really not sure of the inner workings of that

1 [2017-02-05T19:03:38] <killerspaz> Not because it's a bigger image, but because more is operating.... You can have an Alpine based image with a 2gb file copied to it and it'd consume less memory than a standard debian image.
2 [2017-02-05T19:05:08] <killerspaz> snimavat: likely the daemon hung a short bit, enough for the timediff to be great enough to invalidate requests. You should be able to restart the daemon (docker-machine restart)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-06T13:07:59] <marcelmfs> egyptianpharoh: here's one fix: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-06T15:26:16] <marcelmfs> snimavat: osx's docker VM is set to be UTC, you don't have an option there.
2 [2017-02-06T15:27:19] <marcelmfs> What you CAN do, however, is to create a docker image with a different TZ setting, it's up to you to set that up.
3 [2017-02-06T15:28:19] <marcelmfs> in order to check the TZ setting of the docker machine (VM served by Xhyve hypervisor on osx), do the following:
4 [2017-02-06T15:28:22] <marcelmfs> screen -AmdS docker ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty
5 [2017-02-06T15:28:30] <marcelmfs> screen -S docker -p 0 -X stuff
6 [2017-02-06T15:28:41] <marcelmfs> screen -r docker
7 [2017-02-06T15:28:49] <marcelmfs> then:cat /etc/TZ
8 [2017-02-06T15:29:36] <marcelmfs> you can also change the contents of/etc/TZ, but that will be volatile, if you reinstall/restart docker you'll lose that change.
9 [2017-02-06T15:30:48] <marcelmfs> to disconnect from thescreensession, doControl-A, D, and then to kill the screen:screen -S docker -X quit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-06T15:36:30] <killerspaz> snimavat: i was under the impression that docker for osx still requires a VM, which must be created via docker-machine

1 [2017-02-06T18:32:52] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: Docker still uses a VM but it doesn't rely on any non-native libraries to do it. It uses some kind of Virtualisation layer based in MacOS kernel.

1 [2017-02-06T23:38:27] <LuisUrrutia> Hi there,I have 3 webapps (angular), so i want to know if i want to deploy it through docker i have to:create 1 docker for every webapp and (3 dockers) + 1 docker of nginx? \ncreate 1 docker for every webapp with nginx in every container (3 dockers webapp + nginx)?\ncreate a single docker with all of this?I want to update every single webapp in isolated way.. so what is the best way to archive that?
2 [2017-02-06T23:42:11] <LuisUrrutia> So, i have to create 1 container with nginx, and 1 container for every webapp right? 4 container in total, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-06T23:40:42] <dragon788> You could use a single nginx to front and potentially load balance your applications but you'll need to manage service discovery using one of the many tools available
2 [2017-02-06T23:41:09] <dragon788> Keeping your other applications isolated is a good idea
3 [2017-02-06T23:43:03] <SISheogorath> I personally would prefer traefik instead of nginx as loadbalancer
4 [2017-02-06T23:45:00] <SISheogorath> As an API driven reverse Proxy its more or less the future
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-06T23:48:24] <LuisUrrutia> oh, all right, but with traefik my webapps must be served by a web server or not? i mean, reverse proxy doesn't serve files right? this just link to an internal service running in a port, or not?
2 [2017-02-06T23:52:42] <SISheogorath> yes, that's correct
3 [2017-02-06T23:54:08] <LuisUrrutia> Which webserver would you recommend? express, nginx, apache, other?
4 [2017-02-06T23:57:04] <SISheogorath> if you already serve your webpage using NodeJS than express is the right choice. In case you have no backend: nginx as fastest or apache as most common webserver.
5 [2017-02-07T00:01:50] <killerspaz> nginx is good and can be a super simple setup, but the docs are horrible
6 [2017-02-07T00:02:35] <killerspaz> let me rephrase, the docs are good, but not even near thorough
7 [2017-02-07T00:13:02] <LuisUrrutia> oh ok, thanks u very much@dragon788@SISheogorath@killerspaz! :D
8 [2017-02-07T00:23:33] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: the wonderful docs from apache are the reason I still stay with it :D
9 [2017-02-07T00:29:13] <killerspaz> the wonderful memory leak it's had since it's inception is the reason i don't :P
10 [2017-02-07T00:29:36] <killerspaz> honestly i just started using nginx about a year ago, and not in too advanced of ways yet
11 [2017-02-07T00:29:45] <killerspaz> hardest thing i've done with it is ssl websockets
12 [2017-02-07T00:29:49] <killerspaz> and that wasn't that hard
13 [2017-02-07T00:31:01] <SISheogorath> nginx as reverse proxy in docker -> If it can't resolve the ip of the service the container dies... That was annoying and there is only a ugly workaround
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 [2017-02-07T03:12:15] <killerspaz> you can spin up another docker machine, sure
3 [2017-02-07T03:12:35] <killerspaz> would it suffice to build a separate docker-compose and use an alternate network?
4 [2017-02-07T03:12:41] <killerspaz> that would be less overhead on your system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-07T06:36:53] <ely029> guys in the production server? what do you prefer in booting a docker container? create a .sh file or start it from running docker-compose up in the terminal?
2 [2017-02-07T06:39:10] <ixiadev1_twitter> we should run it from docker-compose
3 [2017-02-07T06:39:37] <ixiadev1_twitter> but usually, I have installed Rancher to manage it
4 [2017-02-07T06:53:56] <ely029> I have problem in docker. It seems the php and apache is started up but When I was refreshing the php file its looks like a text file
5 [2017-02-07T06:55:33] <ely029> alright
6 [2017-02-07T06:55:42] <ely029> here is the scenario.
7 [2017-02-07T06:56:59] <ely029> I ran the docker-compose then its all up then WHen I refresh the php file is not working correctly but when I running a html file its looks fine
8 [2017-02-07T06:57:08] <ely029> I think the problem is the php?
9 [2017-02-07T06:59:20] <ely029> the apache is up and running
10 [2017-02-07T06:59:51] <ely029> I am just make a sample phpinfo in a php file
11 [2017-02-07T07:00:04] <ely029> thats weird

1 [2017-02-07T09:33:24] <jeserkin> hey guys
2 [2017-02-07T09:34:18] <jeserkin> can there be multipleEXPOSEcalls in same Dockerfile?
3 [2017-02-07T09:44:07] <jeserkin> I've just looked at 3 different components

7 [2017-02-07T09:45:27] <jeserkin> and at the end two of them have different ports
8 [2017-02-07T09:46:09] <jeserkin> I would like to group those 3 components under 1 Dockerfile :)
9 [2017-02-07T10:43:05] <jeserkin> I did hope, that it would be easier, but I haven't found any suitable container for my needs...sadly
10 [2017-02-07T10:43:34] <jeserkin> As mentioned I do require debian, apache2.4, mysql and php7
11 [2017-02-07T10:43:56] <jMonsinjon> In the same container ?
12 [2017-02-07T10:44:01] <jeserkin> Yes
13 [2017-02-07T10:44:05] <jeserkin> As one vm
14 [2017-02-07T10:44:25] <jMonsinjon> Couldn't mysql stay in its own container ?
15 [2017-02-07T10:45:17] <jeserkin> What would I win with that? Generaly on hosting everything is in same place if we are not talking about AWS of course.
16 [2017-02-07T10:46:17] <jMonsinjon> In Docker philosophy, a container only run a single process
17 [2017-02-07T10:46:46] <jMonsinjon> If you want to use Mysql, run a mysql container
18 [2017-02-07T10:47:10] <jMonsinjon> You want tu run an apache server with httpd ? Run an apache container
19 [2017-02-07T10:47:23] <sopanshewale> in service - one container
20 [2017-02-07T10:52:31] <jMonsinjon> jeserkin: In your case, I would take the Apache Dockerfile, and I would add a RUN instruction to install php. And I will use another container for MySQL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-07T09:36:40] <jMonsinjon> Hi, not a best practice but yes you can !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-07T10:08:12] <jMonsinjon> Hi@jeserkin, lot of work for doing that. Keep in mind that your container's lifecycle will be associate to the PID 1 lifecycle. (That's why in httpd and apache2, the CMD instruction launchs the applications in foreground). So you have to choose wich one will run in foreground...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-07T10:58:21] <jMonsinjon> Hummmm I'm not an expert but, old VMWare apps uses VTx for virtualization, and Docker needs new Hyper-V virtualization
2 [2017-02-07T10:59:02] <Vernuft123> Hyper-V needs to be enabled at OS level am i right?
3 [2017-02-07T10:59:07] <jMonsinjon> If you disable Hyper-V to run VMWare with VTx, it seems that Docker will not run
4 [2017-02-07T10:59:19] <jMonsinjon> I think so...
5 [2017-02-07T10:59:40] <Vernuft123> Ok, il try at my Home PC to see if task manager shows virtualisation as enabled
6 [2017-02-07T10:59:47] <Vernuft123> then il set HYPER-V in windows
7 [2017-02-07T10:59:51] <Vernuft123> hpefully that will work
8 [2017-02-07T10:59:56] <Vernuft123> thanks for your input
9 [2017-02-07T11:00:18] <jMonsinjon> you're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-07T13:35:38] <SISheogorath> jeserkin: The practice to have one container per process makes sure everything is scalable. A container in Docker is not a VM. The whole Docker ecosystem is not build to work like that. So if you push everything in a single container you'll run in trouble soon. It's easier and better to follow the one process per container rule and use one of the tutorials who explain how to setup application this way
2 [2017-02-07T21:35:20] <SISheogorath>  [<-CODE->] In genereal you can mount the volume to a directory in your filesystem. In this case you make sure it is accessible on all nodes in your multi node setup or use it like a regular directory in a single node setup.If you have a more complex structure it highly depends on your backend. In general on multinode setups you want to use a volume driver like rexray or gluster or s3. If you are on a single node setup you may want to use named volumes. [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-02-07T21:36:57] <SISheogorath> thePedroPaulino: Dockers best pratice say one process per container. And your image should be as minimal as possible. So you should use 2 dockerfiles

Right now I am working on an Angular 2 app that integrates with Firebase. From my understanding the workflow with docker is to have a docker file in the directory in which you are doing development, then have docker mount your working directory and build everything inside of the container?

1 [2017-02-08T18:40:14] <verwilst> I'm wondering how to run docker in production.. do you start loads of docker containers on the OS of the physical server? Or do you guys contain the containers per customer for example in an additional qemu vm for example?

2 [2017-02-09T06:02:52] <mingsterism> i want to stream data between 2 docker containers on the same network within a single host
3 [2017-02-09T06:03:05] <mingsterism> how can that  be done?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T07:54:47] <ely029> I have a problem about networking. How can I make a same gateway to connect 2 image containers here is my docker-compose.yml```version: '2'services:  frontend:   build: .   container_name: erp2_frontend   networks:      erp2_frontend:          ipv4_address: 172.25.0.1   ports: [<-CODE->] volumes: [<-CODE->] links: [<-CODE->] backend:   image: alpine:latest   container_name: erp2_backend   networks:     erp2_backend:         ipv4_address: 172.25.0.2   ports: [<-CODE->] networks:   erp2_frontend:      driver: bridge      ipam:        config: [<-CODE->] erp2_backend:      driver: bridge      ipam:        config: [<-CODE->] ```
2 [2017-02-09T07:56:28] <ely029> sorry I pass it again
3 [2017-02-09T07:56:53] <ely029>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-02-09T08:29:13] <ely029> how can I connect them?
5 [2017-02-09T08:50:07] <ely029> connect the 2 containers I dont have any idea? with different gateway they can coomunicate?
6 [2017-02-09T09:31:01] <ely029> how can I ran a docker command in the docker-compose.yml file?

3 [2017-02-09T08:17:09] <comeUpWithItLater> What if i want to use other dir outside of  /Users?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T11:17:15] <jMonsinjon> ely029: Why did you create 2 different networks with the same subnet ? If you want them to communication, the easiest way is tu put them into same bridge subnetwork
2 [2017-02-09T11:17:53] <jMonsinjon> ely029: In the bridge subnetwork, containers can communicate by service name
3 [2017-02-09T11:19:40] <jMonsinjon> ely029: I do not use "link" anymore since DNS resolution in bridge networks
4 [2017-02-09T11:22:48] <jMonsinjon> ely029: Consider this docker-compose file :
5 [2017-02-09T11:23:12] <jMonsinjon>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-02-09T11:24:33] <jMonsinjon> In your container 'erp2_frontend' you can execute a request like ' [<-LINK->] ' and it will respond
7 [2017-02-09T11:25:43] <jMonsinjon> ely029: And if you must have two separate networks, your frontend service could be registered in both

1 [2017-02-09T11:51:36] <atul1989> i want to build new docker images from my container, means once i hit command docker build so to go instead of public docker hub it should pick FROM OS , to private docker registry which i configured , Please help to find out solution for same problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T16:05:24] <dragon788> to push to a private registry you need to tag the image with the address of your registry as the first portion of the name and then when you push it will use that to know where to push it
2 [2017-02-09T16:06:17] <dragon788> egdocker tag myimage my.repository.url/myimage:latestand when you push it then it should push it to your internal repository, but double check the docs on that because I'm going from memory that's nearly a year old

1 [2017-02-09T16:07:23] <ciminuv> Hi everyone, I am new to Docker, I have just successfuly deployed a new Rails app to Docker Cloud. But It looks like everything (all services describled in docker-compose) is packed as a single image running on Docker Cloud. So that on the production, I cannot check to see the status ofpostgres,redis,sidekiq, etc.
2 [2017-02-09T16:07:53] <ciminuv> Everything work well on development mode by following command:docker-compose up, but production.
3 [2017-02-09T16:09:41] <ciminuv> Any ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T16:54:35] <onerealfunnyguy> can anyone point me in the right direction to get docker networking set-up to run home-assistant run inside docker and still be able to scan all the devices on the pysical lan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T17:13:45] <killerspaz> Quick question, I had my head wrapped around this and now i'm stumped... I have nvm installing node in the build, works fine, but when i useCMD  node /app/index.jsit says node isn't found... Also when runningenvmy node env vars are missing (it actually appears to show my LOCAL environment vars) ... When I run the image and bash in, it DOES find node, and my env vars are fine. WHYYYYY
2 [2017-02-09T17:14:12] <killerspaz> usingENTRYPOINT node .orENTRYPOINT ['node', '.']neither work
3 [2017-02-09T17:14:47] <killerspaz> however, if i copynode .into anentrypoint.shand doENTRYPOINT ./entrypoint.shit works juuuuust fine, but i don't want an entire file for a single command like that
4 [2017-02-09T17:15:21] <killerspaz> note:ENTRYPOINT /bin/sh -c "node ."DOES work, but I don\'t want to reference/bin/shin any fashion.
5 [2017-02-09T17:21:22] <killerspaz> I'm sure@dragon788or@SISheogorathhave some wisdom to dole out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T17:23:12] <dragon788> so you have node installed inside the container? have you inserted the install location to the PATH inside the container as well?
2 [2017-02-09T17:27:43] <killerspaz> yep
3 [2017-02-09T17:28:17] <killerspaz> like i said, if i run the container manually but pass/bin/bashat the end to bash in, it shows all the right env vars, binary points to the right path, my PATH is right, etc etc
4 [2017-02-09T17:28:34] <killerspaz> it's literally like OUTSIDE of the container executing IN doesn't work, and it's stumping the hell out of me
5 [2017-02-09T17:36:42] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-02-09T17:36:44] <killerspaz> my setup
7 [2017-02-09T17:37:39] <killerspaz> actually, that's latest in git, we've fixed the ENV vars to hold the proper paths, if anyone catches that... there's a/versions/missing out of theNODE_PATHandPATHvars
8 [2017-02-09T17:38:07] <killerspaz> i just hate seeing /bin/sh in front of the command
9 [2017-02-09T17:39:19] <killerspaz> we're doing this a ton in alpine images, this is our only ubuntu based image... that's about the only major difference
10 [2017-02-09T18:21:45] <killerspaz> Back in the day you had to, now it automatically does that, the output even indicates it's setting an alias default -> v7.2.1 and setting up symlinks
11 [2017-02-09T18:21:55] <killerspaz> which btw, again, when i bash in, all exist correctly
12 [2017-02-09T18:54:11] <killerspaz> even withnvm use nodedoesn't seem to fix anything :/
13 [2017-02-09T19:04:29] <killerspaz> what\'s confusing the hell out of me isCMD executable param1should be/bin/sh -c executable param, but for some reason i\'m having to doCMD /bin/sh -ic executable param1.. which wouldn\'t that translate to/bin sh -c "/bin sh -c \\"executable param\\""????
14 [2017-02-09T19:08:55] <killerspaz> DrummerKH: i've done both
15 [2017-02-09T19:09:11] <killerspaz> scroll up some for my full details of what i've attempted
16 [2017-02-09T19:09:29] <killerspaz> dragon788: it does... but i'm trying to avoid a ton of stupid stuff to start the container
17 [2017-02-09T19:09:40] <killerspaz> in every single Alpine image built literally 100% the exact same way i do not have this issue
18 [2017-02-09T19:09:57] <killerspaz> i can use the exact same docker file and just change to alpine instead of ubuntu and it works as expected
19 [2017-02-09T19:10:31] <killerspaz> DrummerKH: sounds like a bad bridge/ip tables config
20 [2017-02-09T19:10:59] <killerspaz> DrummerKH: see if this helps: [<-ISSUE->]
21 [2017-02-09T19:11:11] <killerspaz> dragon788: there is no "script for alpine", i\'m installing it via the 100% same way
22 [2017-02-09T19:11:19] <killerspaz> it's not adding from the package manager, it's adding from a curl request
23 [2017-02-09T19:11:38] <killerspaz> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
24 [2017-02-09T19:11:47] <killerspaz> nope
25 [2017-02-09T19:12:28] <killerspaz> i checked for that, read the entire source
26 [2017-02-09T19:13:14] <killerspaz> i have no clue why this works with one base image, and not another... neither alpine nor ubuntu define an entrypoint, only a CMD, which i override in both cases withnode .... alpine works, ubuntu doesn't
27 [2017-02-09T19:17:04] <killerspaz> if my ENV vars would work, i think this would be a moot point
28 [2017-02-09T19:24:28] <killerspaz> dragon788: i posted relevant dockerfile and docker-compose setup.... it has something to do with env vars not being available for some reason... i just can't figure it out
29 [2017-02-09T19:26:03] <killerspaz> nope, literally can change the FROM ubuntu to FROM alpine, and get rid of the apt-get stuff, and it works fine here
30 [2017-02-09T19:28:50] <killerspaz> whatever, i'm over this bullshit.... just gonna/bin/sh -cit and hate life for a short bit and move on
31 [2017-02-09T21:22:25] <dragon788> lol
32 [2017-02-09T22:53:58] <killerspaz> any... i use a simple node script to write to stdout or stderr, and only stderr shows unless i specifically usedocker-compose logs... the output fromdocker-compose up(in foreground) is only showing stderr output
33 [2017-02-09T22:57:45] <killerspaz> yep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T18:03:08] <dragon788> so just calling node without a full path works in Alpine?
2 [2017-02-09T18:05:17] <dragon788> after you do annvm install $node_versiondon't you also need to do annvm use nodein order to create the proper symlinks?
3 [2017-02-09T18:05:32] <dragon788> that should eliminate the need to do anything else
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T19:03:34] <DrummerKH> Hi guys, sorry for the offtop. But i think my issue is very stupid :). I have launched nginx container using docker-compose, but from inside the container i cant reach any remote connections differ from 80 or 443 ports. May be you know such problem? For example, i have running webserver on 48002 port on the another machine, i trying using curl connect to it but i got Connection refused, and same error with any port except 80 and 443.
2 [2017-02-09T19:05:49] <DrummerKH> killerspaz: i think you need useCMD ["executable", "param1"]
3 [2017-02-09T19:09:54] <DrummerKH> killerspaz: Ok sorry, may be you know the fix of my issue?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T19:05:57] <dragon788> ahhhh,@killerspazdoes thenvm install $node_versionmodify the.bashrcor.bash_profileor something? if yousource .bashrcafter you do thenvm installyou may be able to call node without having to do much else
2 [2017-02-09T19:10:47] <dragon788> I wonder if the nvm script for alpine does something different for alpine vs ubuntu, like installing to/usr/share/binwhich exists in the path on Alpine but not Ubuntu or something like that
3 [2017-02-09T19:11:42] <dragon788> you are using the nvm.sh script, I'm assuming that has distribution detection and runs different depending on the distro it's installed to
4 [2017-02-09T19:25:07] <dragon788> are you passing in any via ENV that would make it weird? but you said it works fine when Alpine and only breaks on Ubuntu?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T22:03:59] <killerspaz> Anyone notice how docker-compose is only outputting stderr? I have to check logs manually while developing, kind of a PITA
2 [2017-02-09T22:11:37] <killerspaz> that damn/bin/shthing put me in a fowl-ass mood.
3 [2017-02-09T23:11:38] <killerspaz> i'm on docker 1.13 on winows, using a rancheros docker-machine (which iirc is 1.12.6)
4 [2017-02-09T23:11:42] <killerspaz> dunno if that's the problem
5 [2017-02-09T23:11:58] <kbluescode> I'm on Elementary OS LInux, Docker 1.13 on my host machine
6 [2017-02-09T23:12:14] <kbluescode> what are you calling to log to stdout?
7 [2017-02-09T23:17:51] <killerspaz> same as you, console object
8 [2017-02-09T23:17:54] <killerspaz> log/error
9 [2017-02-09T23:17:59] <killerspaz> bbiab, driving home
10 [2017-02-09T23:28:58] <kbluescode> killerspaz: just tested it with docker-machine runningdocker-compose upand it worked fine there too
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-09T22:39:37] <kbluescode> killerspaz: just jumping in here, but what services are you running in docker-compose where you're only seeing stderr?
2 [2017-02-09T22:57:30] <kbluescode> and running just the container by itself withdocker runoutputs the logs fine?
3 [2017-02-09T23:01:19] <kbluescode> weird, I get the same logs back and forth from my go web servers indocker-compose upanddocker-compose logs
4 [2017-02-09T23:03:44] <kbluescode> I'm just going to spin up a custom node container I have and try to run some code in it through compose
5 [2017-02-09T23:11:08] <kbluescode> so yeah, just got it to run fine with docker-compose up
6 [2017-02-09T23:11:17] <kbluescode> just ranconsole.log('hi')and it logged

1 [2017-02-10T09:50:55] <weickmanna> building a container with a docker version that is greater than the docker version that will eventually run that container … is that a safe thing to do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-10T13:04:49] <jMonsinjon> weickmanna: depends on the number of gap versions
2 [2017-02-10T13:05:17] <jMonsinjon> weickmanna: most important is kernel's hosts versions

2 [2017-02-10T18:25:25] <killerspaz> i mean i made these docker images, and i know it's not the container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-10T18:18:52] <kbluescode> killerspaz: what version of docker-compose?
2 [2017-02-10T18:19:02] <kbluescode> also it might just be the container itself, honestly

1 [2017-02-10T19:10:54] <donny-dont> with a windows container in docker is there a cap on the amount of memory it can use?

4 [2017-02-10T19:13:51] <killerspaz> or... virtualbox or hyper-v?
5 [2017-02-10T19:14:30] <donny-dont> its hyper-v docker for windows 1.13.1 running an image thats descended from microsoft/windowsservercore

7 [2017-02-10T19:15:03] <killerspaz> you supply them while creating.. Never used hyper-v myself, but i'm sure there's a way to change it after the fact
8 [2017-02-10T19:15:17] <donny-dont> ah cool didnt see those options
9 [2017-02-10T19:15:51] <donny-dont> saw a cpu and memory slider when working in linux but nothing in the ui when i switched to windows
10 [2017-02-10T19:23:04] <donny-dont> killerspaz: i think this might be for the linux machines
11 [2017-02-10T19:23:27] <donny-dont> i dont see anything virtual machines for the windows instance
12 [2017-02-10T19:23:35] <donny-dont> granted im new to this so could be missing something
13 [2017-02-10T22:35:01] <donny-dont> killerspaz: in case anyone else ends up asking something similar
14 [2017-02-10T22:35:04] <donny-dont> i got it to work
15 [2017-02-10T22:35:14] <donny-dont> built WebKit for windows in a docker container using MSBuild
16 [2017-02-10T22:35:57] <donny-dont> --memory=Xgand--cpu-count=8
17 [2017-02-10T22:36:01] <donny-dont> solved my problem
18 [2017-02-10T22:36:07] <donny-dont> where X was a stupid number :)
19 [2017-02-10T22:36:21] <donny-dont> doesnt have anything to do with the hyperv settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-10T19:16:29] <killerspaz> Speaking of... does anyone have any sources for discussion around the future of docker on windows? I keep hearing that docker-toolbox isn't going to be supported in the near future, and want to know what that means for us that can't run hyper-v
2 [2017-02-10T19:25:35] <killerspaz> i use docker-toolbox which utilizes the virtualbox driver... the main instructions discuss hyper-v installation as the only alternative for windows, which runs native windows vm's. So i'm pretty sure either way, it's virtual machines. In my linux environments, the docker daemon runs natively in linux, and doesn't require any docker machines
3 [2017-02-10T19:26:29] <donny-dont> k ill keep digging around
4 [2017-02-10T19:26:31] <donny-dont> thank you!
5 [2017-02-10T19:26:35] <killerspaz> sure thing, good luck
6 [2017-02-11T01:13:44] <killerspaz> donny-dont: i was gonna ask if it was actually running out of mem or if your runtime needed more allocated

1 [2017-02-11T15:10:20] <vyscond> why boot2docker needs at least 512mb to run? :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-11T15:11:38] <gadget_mnky_twitter> vyscond: it's a vagrant vm.   Believe that's the minimum for Linux vm these days unless alpine
2 [2017-02-11T15:12:31] <vyscond> gadget_mnky_twitter: No. alpine is not the only one who can run on lower RAM
3 [2017-02-11T17:25:26] <vyscond> SISheogorath: Nope.
4 [2017-02-11T17:25:37] <vyscond> It's based on busybox, Sir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-11T16:59:34] <SISheogorath> hint: boot2docker is based on alpine
2 [2017-02-11T17:28:45] <SISheogorath> oh thanks I remember myself that someone told in the dockercommunity that it's based on alpine but I verified myself now. It's based on [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-02-11T18:36:23] <scippio> Hi all, I know this is not a specific Docker question... but exists some auto-deploy system? I mean... I have some servers with docker-compose services ... but every service need "dynamic" configuration. All configurations are connected via mounted volumes from host system. I have this configs in git ... and everytime I pushed I need pull on defined servers + do some actions (like restart http server etc..).
2 [2017-02-11T18:37:05] <scippio> ..or I must write my own utility for this? :-|
3 [2017-02-11T19:34:48] <scippio> I prefer files ... because I have dozens complex nginx config files... maybe some export into env variable is possible... but I think it's too ugly have this files in env variable ...
4 [2017-02-11T20:00:45] <scippio> SISheogorath: thanks for response... I think I\'ll write my "deployment tool" ... when I push to repository -> hook call my server/s a they run some script/s ...
5 [2017-02-11T20:01:40] <SISheogorath> well basically that's what ansible would do if you add it as a final deployment step :D
6 [2017-02-11T20:03:35] <SISheogorath> btw depending on what you use nginx for you can maybe replace it with traefik which would update it's settings based on the docker API, on the fly or check jwilder's nginx setup which is really awesome if you don't want to use traefik
7 [2017-02-11T20:07:57] <scippio> hmm.. traefik I don't need another web server... I like nginx. and it's not only about nginx but any other dozens services.
8 [2017-02-11T20:19:06] <SISheogorath> traefik is mainly used as reverse proxy and configured by API interface which makes it so powerful. and don't feel offended it was just a recommendation
9 [2017-02-11T20:34:30] <scippio> it's fine.. I understand, but I think traefik isn't what I need...
10 [2017-02-12T12:24:26] <vyscond> scippio: you mean kubernetes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-11T19:27:44] <SISheogorath> In genereal I prefer it to use environment variables to configure my services. Those you can easily edit and docker swarm (for example) will regonize the changes (as you change those variables by using thedocker service updatecommand) and redeploy the service. But I guess you search something like ansible, saltstack, puppet, ... If you really want to do that with files
2 [2017-02-11T19:29:04] <SISheogorath> Another maybe easy way is to use hooks for your version control which then runs something like an ansible playbook to your environment. (Hint: Ansible Tower has these things working nearly out of the box but is not free)
3 [2017-02-11T19:29:20] <SISheogorath> scippio: See above

1 [2017-02-12T20:57:01] <soapoperator> hello, i run a docker-compose config with nginx + php-fpm on a same network.  Unfortunatly, my php file are not interpreted but downloaded. I double check nginx config. My docker-compose file: [<-CODE->] Any idea?
2 [2017-02-12T21:08:06] <soapoperator> killerspaz:  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-02-12T21:21:05] <soapoperator> killerspaz: It doesn't change anything.  Could it be an problem with permissions of the html folder
4 [2017-02-12T21:22:22] <killerspaz> i don't believe so, because something is clearly reading them; php is interpreted, not a runtime, so +x isn't required
5 [2017-02-12T21:22:50] <killerspaz> just try completely removing that block you moved
6 [2017-02-12T21:22:54] <killerspaz> or commenting it out rather
7 [2017-02-12T21:26:08] <killerspaz> btw, you removed and recreated the container, right? when you did that conf change?
8 [2017-02-12T21:27:54] <killerspaz> oh well wait, i just noticed in your paste you have thedefault.confvolume commented out
9 [2017-02-12T21:32:12] <soapoperator> i try to removelocaltion /without anychange.
10 [2017-02-12T21:32:40] <killerspaz> did you see my reference to the comment?
11 [2017-02-12T21:32:54] <soapoperator> for default.conf, i use it in sites-available.
12 [2017-02-12T21:33:55] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
13 [2017-02-12T21:34:27] <killerspaz> your changes aren't taking affect because it's not there
14 [2017-02-12T21:35:19] <soapoperator> i comment it because i was thinking to use nginx default conf, didn't i?
15 [2017-02-12T21:36:23] <soapoperator> if i uncomment it i have to copy the file before, doesn't i?
16 [2017-02-12T21:36:25] <killerspaz> default doesn't use fastpass_cgi for php-fpm to do it's thing
17 [2017-02-12T21:36:51] <killerspaz> your default.conf you pasted does, but you're not putting that into the container for nginx to actually DO that
18 [2017-02-12T21:37:55] <killerspaz> uncomment,docker-compose down && docker-compose up -dand try again
19 [2017-02-12T21:44:44] <soapoperator> Things are changing... When i try to access to my php file i get anERR_CONNECTION_RESET... conf.d/default.conf is empty. I have to populate it.
20 [2017-02-12T21:46:09] <killerspaz> how are you verifying the conf is empty?
21 [2017-02-12T21:57:14] <soapoperator> i was thinking there is a duplication between./config/sites-available/default.conf:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.confand./config/conf.d/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.confin my volume...
22 [2017-02-12T21:58:21] <soapoperator> maybe i have to mount in a volume/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
23 [2017-02-12T22:01:16] <killerspaz> if anything i'd volume mount /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
24 [2017-02-12T22:01:24] <killerspaz> if i have it correct
25 [2017-02-12T22:06:32] <killerspaz> but really it's your config, good luck, i gotta go
26 [2017-02-12T22:06:45] <soapoperator> killerspaz: thank you for your help, i will retry tomorow. Now i know it-s only a nginx config issue. I am lost between the config file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-12T21:00:26] <killerspaz> soapoperator: what's the default.conf look like
2 [2017-02-12T21:13:38] <killerspaz> I could be wrong ,but i think it's yourlocation /block triggering
3 [2017-02-12T21:14:00] <killerspaz> put it after thelocation ~ \\.php$block n see if that fixes it

1 [2017-02-12T23:23:29] <simoami> hello, simple question, regarding tagging and pushing an image. if you tag an image (0.0.2) withlatest, does the previous image (0.0.1) lose the latest tag?
2 [2017-02-13T01:47:55] <kinghuang> simoami: Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T08:15:03] <kschlesselmann> What's the way to go if you build on an image that's not on docker hub?FROM <myRegistryUrl>/my/imageCan I insert the source registry with an external config somehow?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T09:01:50] <ketchupmonkey> hi everyone! I have a question about docker swarm in particular the load balancing aspect. I just wanted to clear up something. In a scenario where you have two physical machines and one is the swarm manager while the other one is the worker and they have a docker service which propagated containers to both hosts. If I do changes to my DNS server and point it to one of the physical machines(let's say the manager) and it wants to direct the request to the other machine(the worker) does that mean it will do an additional hop?
2 [2017-02-13T09:02:43] <ketchupmonkey> to reach the worker machine and as a result you don't have the same performance findings when comparing both machines?
3 [2017-02-13T09:03:09] <ketchupmonkey> or is there a way where both machines share a single IP?
4 [2017-02-13T09:04:34] <ketchupmonkey> the other solution I could think of is having a load balancer(like AWS elasticloadbalancer) in front of it but I am worried that if aws forwards the request to one of the nodes(manager) what if that nodes tries to send it to the other host(worker) then that adds an additional hop to reach the service/site
5 [2017-02-13T09:04:47] <ketchupmonkey> am I understanding this correctly or I've just confused myself
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T09:14:44] <ugurarpaci> The second case works exactly the same as you explained. In swarm mode, the daemon process aquires @ binds the published port and route the requests to the instances which is either manager or worker.
2 [2017-02-13T09:15:27] <ugurarpaci> Hope that helps
3 [2017-02-13T09:16:29] <ugurarpaci> on ELB case, even if the ec2 is not behind the elb the hop operation you mentioned emerges.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T09:53:50] <verwilst> How would you setup multiple httpd vhosts on a server with docker?
2 [2017-02-13T09:54:25] <verwilst> Each website its own php-fpm container and httpd container with shared webroot, i get that. But then you need an ip per website..
3 [2017-02-13T09:54:42] <ugurarpaci> You can use a reverse proxy ?@verwilst
4 [2017-02-13T09:54:53] <verwilst> Do you guys put a proxy in front of it? and the individual httpd containers listen on other ports?
5 [2017-02-13T09:55:12] <ugurarpaci> This is a dynamic proxy [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-02-13T09:55:26] <ugurarpaci> there is also haproxy version of that
7 [2017-02-13T09:55:28] <verwilst> so client -> httpd:80 -> httpd:8001 for example
8 [2017-02-13T09:55:54] <ugurarpaci> client -> proxy:80 -> httpd:80
9 [2017-02-13T09:56:06] <ugurarpaci> you wont have to expose & bind http's port
10 [2017-02-13T09:56:24] <ugurarpaci> so, all of your httpd processes can use the same port
11 [2017-02-13T09:56:48] <ugurarpaci> proxy will be routing it with the proper hostname
12 [2017-02-13T09:57:50] <verwilst> hm, but is linking new containers to the proxy once it's running even possible?
13 [2017-02-13T09:59:26] <ugurarpaci> proxy container mounts the docker socket daemon and listens docker events, this is what makes it dynamic actually. When a new container comes comes in with "docker run",  its event generation enables the routing thing.
14 [2017-02-13T09:59:55] <ugurarpaci> This process is actually explained in github page
15 [2017-02-13T10:04:32] <verwilst> i see
16 [2017-02-13T10:05:31] <ugurarpaci> I run more than 30 containers behind it, I must say it is smooth as hell
17 [2017-02-13T10:05:35] <ugurarpaci> so take a shot
18 [2017-02-13T10:06:09] <verwilst> i'd rather use apache, but i can base my knowledge off of the nginx-proxy thing :-)
19 [2017-02-13T10:06:48] <verwilst> is it secure to mount the docker unix socket?
20 [2017-02-13T10:07:04] <ugurarpaci> you mount it as read-only
21 [2017-02-13T10:07:27] <ugurarpaci> therefore no action is taken by the proxy
22 [2017-02-13T10:07:56] <verwilst> yeah, but maybe it could read sensitive data ;-)
23 [2017-02-13T10:32:47] <ugurarpaci> You are right, since it is a public image you can be cautious, you can create your own proxy image
24 [2017-02-13T15:47:00] <verwilst> you can read events through the ruby api, but the python api doesn't seem to have that feature
25 [2017-02-13T17:49:30] <ugurarpaci> you can use go as well@verwilst
26 [2017-02-13T20:00:45] <verwilst> i'd rather use python :-D

1 [2017-02-13T17:05:56] <Crizstian> Hello community this week, i’m bringing to you the third part of the series in "Build a NodeJS cinema microservice", that i wrote @medium and  it’s fully charged of nodejs development, as always i’m open to get feedback, contributions, or just a comment below =]https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-booking-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-3-9c384e21fbe0#.4il886ym9
2 [2017-02-14T19:03:45] <Crizstian> Thanks for the advice i will check it@SISheogorath
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T23:49:24] <scippio> vyscond: no... kubernetes is absolute different what I need... I just need deploy tool only.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-13T23:50:02] <ketchupmonkey> thanks@ugurarpacisorry for the late reply. Thank you for the info. I guess that is the drawback if we use docker swarm to distribute multiple containers
2 [2017-02-13T23:50:41] <ketchupmonkey> ugurarpaci: oh although I have a question what happens if the manager dies? as far as  I know you can only have one manager in a cluster right? or can you have multipler managers in a docker swarm?
3 [2017-02-14T00:39:17] <ketchupmonkey> SISheogorath: thanks i'll try to read up on the swarm modes i'm not really familiar with that.
4 [2017-02-14T00:41:19] <SISheogorath> ketchupmonkey: checkout [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-14T00:42:16] <ketchupmonkey> SISheogorath: thank you so much for link
6 [2017-02-14T00:42:17] <ketchupmonkey> :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T00:29:33] <SISheogorath> ketchupmonkey: It depends on what swarm you use. If you use swarmmode multiple managers are easy. If you use classic swarm multiple managers are possible but way more complex
2 [2017-02-14T00:31:51] <SISheogorath> verwilst: you can also take a look at Traefik. It works great and is more and more widely used

1 [2017-02-14T05:32:40] <ely029> how can I attach a bak file in a mssql server container?this is my docker-compose code: [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T12:04:38] <RobertBroersma> Hi Guys. I'm trying to build an angular2 app in a docker container and sharing the code via a volume with my nginx container. However I'm not seeing the dist folder appear in my container/volume. Am I doing something wrong?
2 [2017-02-14T12:06:02] <RobertBroersma> This is my angular dockerfile [<-CODE->] /usr/src/client is my volume folder
3 [2017-02-14T12:24:47] <RobertBroersma> atm like so: [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-02-14T12:25:49] <RobertBroersma> However I don't see the dist folder appearing either when I dodocker-compose run client ls /usr/src/clientIt seems like it only creates it and copies files to it the first time it runs, and it doesnt change after that
5 [2017-02-14T12:43:40] <RobertBroersma> It takes new files only when I dodocker-compose downand thendocker-compose up -d, so only first run
6 [2017-02-14T12:47:33] <RobertBroersma> Hmm, not even always then :/
7 [2017-02-14T13:35:58] <RobertBroersma> It works when I remove the volume and then docker-compose down and up
8 [2017-02-14T13:36:19] <RobertBroersma> I'm fairly new to docker, is there a better way, with some kind of non-persistent volume?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T12:17:45] <SISheogorath> RobertBroersma: how did you share the volume?
2 [2017-02-14T15:38:56] <SISheogorath> I'm actually not sure why you share the code by volume >.>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T15:43:03] <dragon788> ideally you would do the copies in your Dockerfile, you would simply volume mount your code directly where you need it in the container
2 [2017-02-14T15:43:10] <dragon788> then any changes you require will sync both ways
3 [2017-02-14T15:43:33] <dragon788> if you need a one way sync where it mounts the code but can't change it, you can change the volume mount options for that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T16:42:58] <RobertBroersma> I just read that I shouldn't ask my questions here. Should I go somewhere else?@SISheogorath Like I said I'm new to docker. I'm not sure why either. I just searched how to share my code with another container.@dragon788 I'm not sure what you mean. How is it different to volume mount in Dockerfile than in compose file? Basically what I have on my client container is a dist folder that I want to share with my nginx container
2 [2017-02-14T16:44:26] <killerspaz> RobertBroersma: no he's saying copy in your dockerfile, don't mount via ANYTHING
3 [2017-02-14T16:45:23] <killerspaz> COPY . /pathand notVOLUME /pathor-v path:/pathOR the volumes listed in your docker-compose
4 [2017-02-14T16:47:58] <RobertBroersma> @dragon788 I'll take from that I can continue here ;) [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-02-14T16:52:15] <killerspaz> you might need to elaborate fully on what your requirements are
6 [2017-02-14T16:54:52] <RobertBroersma> I have container 1: client. It has a ready for production dist folder.I have container 2: nginx. It runs nginx with a configuration to serve my static dist folder.I want to access the dist folder of client in nginx.
7 [2017-02-14T16:55:39] <RobertBroersma> It is for production. No need to update when I update code on my host
8 [2017-02-14T18:23:50] <killerspaz> use a volume in dockerfile and volumes-from in nginx
9 [2017-02-14T18:24:08] <killerspaz> i'm fighting dynamic ssl certs with IP changes :S
10 [2017-02-14T20:22:34] <RobertBroersma> Will try tomorrow, thanks@killerspaz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-14T16:44:22] <dragon788> RobertBroersma: there don't appear to be a lot of folks from Docker actually here discussing the project and how to contribute so there is a lot of Q&A, there is also the #Docker channel on IRC where people hang out, and it isn't currently synced up to this channel so asking in either place usually gets some sort of response
2 [2017-02-14T16:47:21] <dragon788> yeah, ideally you do it one way or the other, you either copy in everything every time it is run, or you do a straight volume mount at runtime (via docker run or docker compose) instead of doing both
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T08:03:53] <ugurarpaci> ketchupmonkey: do not even dare to use a single master on production :D
2 [2017-02-15T08:05:01] <ugurarpaci> If you like the action and high blood tension use 3, If you like to have a barbecue away from work, use 5 =)
3 [2017-02-15T08:05:33] <ugurarpaci> It depends on the CAP theorem, all in all It is what it is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T08:08:00] <tleguijt> ugurarpaci: I'm wondering; since you are on this topic, what if you have an average-load website. Right now we are running an Django application on a EC2 instance but want to convert my deployment to a Docker Swarm one (or utilize AWS Docker orchestration). Big plus is rolling updates and easy scaling. However, most of the times two small instances both running 1 docker instance of that application will be sufficient
2 [2017-02-15T08:08:27] <tleguijt> However, it will mean I will have at most 1 swarm master (or 2 masters that both controls the only 2 nodes that are in the swarm - if that even makes sense..)
3 [2017-02-15T08:09:16] <tleguijt> or will I instead have three running instances; one tiny one acting as KVS + swarm master, one running the application and acts as a second swarm master, and one node with only the application (part of the swarm as well)
4 [2017-02-15T08:09:32] <tleguijt> in case of scaling up we could spin up our 4th, 5th, etc.. EC2 instances
5 [2017-02-15T08:16:24] <ugurarpaci> -swarm seems working fine on auto-scaling on aws. Even if you are running a single ec2 instance, It is a nice practice to spin them up in autoscaling groups.-this is a general advise. If this is a development or pre-production environment, I guess it is okay to run it on a single EC2; first it is cost effective and It is easy to maintain since your are dealing with one EC2 (as soon as you do the backing up swarm directory to some other place like S3).On the other hand, If this environment is on production, you will still need at least 2 EC2 on different AZ to satisfy best practises of AWS. You can spin up a "t2" type instance master-only instance to satisfy consensus alongside to these 2 production servers.
6 [2017-02-15T08:21:37] <tleguijt> with those master-only instances in each AZ you mean just an instance that acts as a master or one that also runs the application instances? (in other words; only 1 instance that does-it-all per AZ or 2 instances per AZ (one acting as master, one acting as the node running the actual application)
7 [2017-02-15T08:24:15] <ugurarpaci> behind the elb, 2 managers. In addition to that 1 more manager-only (releatively a cheap instance just to satisfy the consensus) which does not accepts any requests.
8 [2017-02-15T08:26:02] <tleguijt> sounds reasonable, the manager-only instance could also serve as KVS
9 [2017-02-15T08:26:28] <ugurarpaci> sure
10 [2017-02-15T08:27:26] <ugurarpaci> If cost is not the concern, you can spin up identical 3 ec2 as kick-off all managers, then add rest of the incoming instances as workers
11 [2017-02-15T08:28:46] <tleguijt> you mean those 3 ec2 instances divided over 3 AZs?
12 [2017-02-15T08:29:00] <ugurarpaci> exactly
13 [2017-02-15T08:29:13] <ugurarpaci> in the VPC, of course
14 [2017-02-15T08:29:50] <tleguijt> we have to be cost-efficient, so the following setup might be a good trade-off:AZ1:   node1 (manager-only), node2 (manager + worker), node3 (worker-only)AZ2:  node4 (manager + worker)AZ3: node5 (worker-only)
15 [2017-02-15T08:29:57] <tleguijt> having the managers also span at least 2 AZs
16 [2017-02-15T08:31:03] <ugurarpaci> looks good
17 [2017-02-15T08:31:43] <tleguijt> great, thanks for your thoughts :-)
18 [2017-02-15T08:51:58] <ugurarpaci> NP

1 [2017-02-15T14:43:34] <murbanowicz> anyone here using nginx-proxy ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T17:02:16] <austinfrey> i\'m getting the following errorcontainer_linux.go:247: starting container process caused "exec: \\"node\\": executable file not found in $PATH"but node is definitely in the path and i can start my application manually from inside a running container, but not from command line with docker run or from the dockerfile withCMD ["node", "server.js"]
2 [2017-02-15T17:03:21] <austinfrey> ic an provide more details if needed, but this seems to work on one machine an not the other, any help is appreciated
3 [2017-02-15T17:19:44] <austinfrey> I'll try it, thanks. weird though, that it works on one machine but not another
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T17:18:56] <killerspaz> aafrey: Had this problem as well, no clue why it doesn\'t work the way docs say it should (i.e.,CMD node server.jsshould translate tosh -cexecution).... So I had to manually doCMD sh -c "node server.js"
2 [2017-02-15T17:19:43] <killerspaz> And actually I think i neededsh -icfor interactive login (i.e., reads user bash profile/bashrc)
3 [2017-02-15T17:20:08] <killerspaz> For my alpine images,CMD nodejs .works fine, for debian-based it isn't for some reason
4 [2017-02-15T17:24:24] <austinfrey> killerspaz: CMD sh -c "node server.js"did the trick, thanks! you saved me an afternoon of misery!
5 [2017-02-15T17:28:49] <SISheogorath> aafrey: use ["node", "server.js"] instead
6 [2017-02-15T17:29:03] <killerspaz> he was
7 [2017-02-15T17:29:10] <killerspaz> same problem i was having the other day
8 [2017-02-15T17:29:25] <killerspaz> it doesn't appear to be an interactive login, so env vars are just completely ignored
9 [2017-02-15T17:30:17] <killerspaz> I'm sure it's a bug, but I don't have the patience or time to formulate the proper words to describe it :P maybe after this insane rush to deadline i can contribute more
10 [2017-02-15T17:31:03] <SISheogorath> Nope he said he usedCMD "node server.js"which is something else thanCMD ["node", "server.js"]
11 [2017-02-15T17:31:54] <austinfrey> well i spoke to soon, usingCMD sh -c "node server.js"just leaves me withsh: not foundinstead
12 [2017-02-15T17:32:23] <austinfrey> and@SISheogorathif you look at my first post I was using your suggestion and that when I received the error
13 [2017-02-15T17:37:14] <SISheogorath> Oh yes, now I see. Sry. I just tested and it works in my case. What base image are you using?
14 [2017-02-15T17:40:23] <SISheogorath> node:6as well asnode:6-alpinework fine for me
15 [2017-02-15T17:43:27] <austinfrey> SISheogorath: I'm using alpine but i rolled my own image.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T17:58:15] <SISheogorath> Possibly there is a problem. Is it a fork of the original image?
2 [2017-02-15T18:01:23] <killerspaz> aafrey: alpine usesashshell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T18:21:29] <austinfrey> guys... i'm feeling foolish... i'd accidentally set my env PATH variable to something else...
2 [2017-02-15T18:23:51] <austinfrey> thanks for lending a hand
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-15T18:31:20] <lev-kuznetsov> Anybody here uses [<-LINK->] ? I'm trying to find API to get the host IP address of my container if I'm running in a Swarm
2 [2017-02-15T18:58:14] <lev-kuznetsov> More general then; I started a docker-machine VM on my Mac and did a swarm init.docker infoshows swarm active. When I start a container and dodocker inspect <container>it doesn't have theNodefield I would expect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T03:09:53] <killerspaz> Trying to get docker volume mounted into my jenkins container, anyone had success? I currently have: [<-CODE->] When I "exec" in i indeed see the binary, it is +x, but when i run it, it says not found still.... permissions look "ok" inside container [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-02-16T03:10:35] <killerspaz> started down the path via: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-02-16T03:22:16] <killerspaz> and to mention i'm running the official alpine image
4 [2017-02-16T03:38:26] <killerspaz> my understanding is i need docker out of docker as i've seen it coined in DooD in a blog post here: [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-16T03:38:39] <killerspaz> which i'm attempting, and apparently failing :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T04:27:35] <SISheogorath> Did you start Jenkins privileged?
2 [2017-02-16T04:28:02] <killerspaz> mm no, never saw that anywhere, i can try that
3 [2017-02-16T04:29:57] <killerspaz> still nope
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T04:35:37] <SISheogorath> If you really run docker in docker you need it. In you case you want to use the CLI. Not sure why it breaks. Can you runlddfor the docker command? To make sure nothing is missing
2 [2017-02-16T04:37:36] <SISheogorath> Oh and try to run your container with-u root
3 [2017-02-16T04:37:58] <killerspaz> so if i'm using compose, how do i do that? didn't see a reference in the compose format
4 [2017-02-16T04:39:09] <SISheogorath> Eh nice question >.> I'm not a fan/user of compose files
5 [2017-02-16T04:39:26] <SISheogorath> Not use about it but maybe there is a userflag too
6 [2017-02-16T04:41:08] <killerspaz> i saw group_add, which i added a user/group in the host, and added that user to docker group as well, so i'm expecting it to have elevated permissions
7 [2017-02-16T04:43:23] <SISheogorath> Yes, that's maybe it I guess it's a problem of your docker socket
8 [2017-02-16T04:44:23] <killerspaz> i'm running jenkins in a docker, which needs docker for the pipeline
9 [2017-02-16T04:44:47] <killerspaz> if i could avoid building a custom image by volume mounting the host docker, i'd prefer that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T06:20:12] <coding-yogi> Hi guys, I am unable to access our intranet nexus repo from inside the docker
2 [2017-02-16T06:20:20] <coding-yogi> I get the error, connection refused
3 [2017-02-16T06:20:29] <coding-yogi> any idea about how to get this working?
4 [2017-02-16T08:24:04] <ugurarpaci> murbanowicz: yeah
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T09:04:16] <soapoperator> Hello, i try to add some extension to php with docker compose. After some reading, i am trying to add it like that: [<-CODE->] Unfortunatly i get a 502 error.Who can i add multi commande line correctly?
2 [2017-02-16T09:07:00] <soapoperator> Maybe i have to add this line to the server :nginx:latest
3 [2017-02-16T09:11:38] <soapoperator> Without this, the container works well.
4 [2017-02-16T09:12:23] <sopanshewale> soapoperator: - i think you need to add  this inside Dockerfile
5 [2017-02-16T09:12:33] <sopanshewale> not in docker-compose, right?
6 [2017-02-16T09:13:00] <sopanshewale> under "build" value - mention the directory where you have "Dockefile"

1 [2017-02-16T14:13:35] <matrixbot> xav19hi
2 [2017-02-16T14:14:10] <matrixbot> xav19i'm trying to implement 'docker exec' in [<-LINK->] (a rust lib to talk to docker daemon)
3 [2017-02-16T14:14:54] <matrixbot> xav19i'd like to dump/log the http requests made by docker cli to debug what i'm doing
4 [2017-02-16T14:16:41] <matrixbot> xav19i'm on docker for mac
5 [2017-02-16T14:17:32] <matrixbot> xav19i tried to disable tls and use wireshark, but the daemon doesn\'t seem to like {"tls": false, "tlsverify": false}
6 [2017-02-16T14:17:42] <matrixbot> xav19is there an other way to do it ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T15:42:05] <dragon788> xav19: does the docker CLI use HTTP or does it use a direct socket connection?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T15:46:21] <matrixbot> xav19@dragon788, not sure... is there a way to know it?
2 [2017-02-16T15:46:32] <killerspaz> what's with that xav19 crap
3 [2017-02-16T15:46:55] <killerspaz> matrixbot wth
4 [2017-02-16T15:47:50] <matrixbot> xav19i'm not on gitter, i'm on riot.im (a matrix server)
5 [2017-02-16T15:48:06] <killerspaz> Interesting...  Hadn't heard of that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T15:49:12] <xpayn> oh now i (xav19) see the crap
2 [2017-02-16T15:56:27] <xpayn> dragon788: i guess it uses the socket, boondock uses it on any unix system, and it works
3 [2017-02-16T15:57:10] <xpayn> it certainly mimics how the cli works
4 [2017-02-16T15:57:23] <xpayn> but that's just guesses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T15:50:13] <killerspaz> Anyone successfully been able to get docker volume mounted inside another container? Running official Jenkins alpine image, which needs docker inside of it to run a pipeline. Trying to use the host docker daemon to alleviate version mismatches. I can't get it to work!
2 [2017-02-16T16:34:29] <killerspaz> my understanding is the socket, which is why i'm trying to mount it inside a container (unsuccessfully)
3 [2017-02-16T16:37:28] <xpayn> killerspaz: did you see this [<-LINK->] ?
4 [2017-02-16T16:38:04] <xpayn> it's a bit old but maybe there's something useful in it
5 [2017-02-16T16:38:10] <killerspaz> yeah but i want to avoid actually installing docker inside the container... I want it to be 100% the same docker daemon/client on the host
6 [2017-02-16T16:39:08] <killerspaz> I'm trying to avoid installing anything primarily to keep administration easy, and keep the version fracturing to zero.
7 [2017-02-16T16:42:38] <xpayn> did you try something likedocker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /path/to/docker/cli:/path/to/docker/cli ubuntu:latest /bin/bash?
8 [2017-02-16T16:43:35] <killerspaz> sure did
9 [2017-02-16T16:43:40] <killerspaz> that doesnt' even work as it is
10 [2017-02-16T16:43:50] <killerspaz> not sure if yo utried that
11 [2017-02-16T16:44:27] <xpayn> nope, i'm on mac, i would be surprise it's even possible on it
12 [2017-02-16T16:44:47] <killerspaz> err yeah, you'd have to do that ON the docker machine
13 [2017-02-16T16:44:53] <killerspaz> very possible though
14 [2017-02-16T16:44:59] <killerspaz> docker-machine ssh "docker run -it ...."
15 [2017-02-16T16:45:10] <killerspaz> i do it often when i need to mount linux-specific volumes
16 [2017-02-16T16:46:29] <killerspaz> but right now i'm on linux native
17 [2017-02-16T16:49:01] <killerspaz> i think it's linked libs are missing...
18 [2017-02-16T16:51:41] <killerspaz> oh yeah i remember someone telling me they changed that.... the landscape for docker is very confusing right now imo
19 [2017-02-16T16:52:56] <killerspaz> HUZZAH!
20 [2017-02-16T16:52:58] <killerspaz> I got it!
21 [2017-02-16T16:53:45] <killerspaz>  [<-LINK->]
22 [2017-02-16T16:53:51] <killerspaz> Needed all the dynamic linked files
23 [2017-02-16T21:23:38] <killerspaz> soapoperator: it's identical to dockerfile
24 [2017-02-16T21:23:58] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T16:50:43] <xpayn> docker for mac seems to be very peculiar beast based on hyperkit,docker-machine lsreturns nothing, not sure you can access the vm as it what possible with docker-toolbox/boot2docker
2 [2017-02-16T17:00:13] <xpayn> well done!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T17:07:51] <killerspaz> damn, ok so via cli i can access, but jenkins still can't :/Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
2 [2017-02-16T18:46:28] <killerspaz> can get it working with sudo added to the container image, but i really don't want that
3 [2017-02-16T20:31:45] <killerspaz> Finally got it all working, just took some stupid guid swap: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T21:13:57] <soapoperator> sopanshewale: interesting approch i don't know. I will try.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-16T22:31:11] <ketchupmonkey> ugurarpaci: haha thanks for the tip I'm just playing around with it no prod plans yet haha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T04:57:51] <soapoperator> @killerspaz i try this way with for example: [<-CODE->] But the container is running well but i get an 502 error when i try to access to php files.
2 [2017-02-17T05:01:44] <soapoperator> right, i didn't give all the config: [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T05:00:22] <killerspaz> i'd assume you'd need some volume to share files to the container, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-02-17T10:12:03] <jaksky> Hello, I am new to docker and docker registry. I have one particular question regarding tagging images. Does thelatestwork in a similar fashion as SNAPSHOT in maven (latest points to the latest image in the repository)?
2 [2017-02-17T11:17:55] <jaksky> SISheogorath: So what is common workflow used when you want to have versioned history of builds but having your compose everytime pull the latest for development purposes??
3 [2017-02-17T11:21:18] <jaksky> SISheogorath: Don't they override each other that the only last one is valid? That was my impression. Are you aware of any documentation where I could find that?
4 [2017-02-17T11:23:35] <SISheogorath> If you assignlatestto a new image, the old image will loose it, yes, but you can assign 9, 9.1, 9.1.3, and latest to the same image
5 [2017-02-17T15:04:02] <SISheogorath> If a tag exists locally it won't download the image. This includes self build images
6 [2017-02-17T15:08:34] <SISheogorath> latestis not an excemption. it is handled like any other tag. It's just the default value if there is nothing specified
7 [2017-02-17T16:19:15] <SISheogorath> in case you use--net=hostyou have all interfaces of the host inside your container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T10:41:52] <jyapujuju> i have installed docker and docker-compsor in arch as wiki said and created new rails app everything is okay and build successfully but don't know where  my all files goes :(
2 [2017-02-17T10:42:02] <jyapujuju> can somebody help me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T11:10:30] <SISheogorath> What files are you searching?
2 [2017-02-17T11:11:46] <SISheogorath> In general docker stores everything in/var/lib/docker/but that something you should never touch until you are very familiar with docker internals
3 [2017-02-17T11:12:23] <jyapujuju> i want them on Document /myapp
4 [2017-02-17T11:12:55] <jyapujuju> how can i do that?
5 [2017-02-17T11:13:32] <SISheogorath> I'm still not sure what exactly you are asking for
6 [2017-02-17T11:13:42] <SISheogorath> What type of files?
7 [2017-02-17T11:14:43] <jyapujuju> files which are build by docker
8 [2017-02-17T11:14:55] <jyapujuju>  [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-02-17T11:15:04] <jyapujuju> i follow the above wiki
10 [2017-02-17T11:15:29] <jyapujuju> i put all 4 files in /documnets/myapp
11 [2017-02-17T11:15:35] <SISheogorath> jaksky: latest is a custom tag which docker uses if nothing else is defined. On registry you have to create it explicitly
12 [2017-02-17T11:15:36] <jyapujuju> its build
13 [2017-02-17T11:17:12] <SISheogorath> jyapujuju: well in this case the files are stored inside your container filesystem. You can access it only while you are in the container or when you run some very ugly mount commands.
14 [2017-02-17T11:18:01] <SISheogorath> To enter the container start it and then rundocker exec -it containerid /bin/sh
15 [2017-02-17T11:19:01] <SISheogorath> jaksky: simply have tags with versions and tag assign thelatesttag to your device build
16 [2017-02-17T11:19:56] <SISheogorath> You can assign multiple tags to the same image.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T12:58:09] <jyapujuju> SISheogorath: so am not doing any wrong?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T14:04:27] <jaksky> SISheogorath: Is it somehow comparing timestamps on images? Let say you have a build server building images and you build it locally for a given tag - will it eventually download new one from repo?
2 [2017-02-17T15:07:39] <jaksky> SISheogorath: latestis not an exception
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T15:22:16] <felixheck> is there an easy way to get host's IP in docker-compose.yml w/o passing envs within thedocker-compose up?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T15:34:30] <SISheogorath> felixheck: why do you need the IP?
2 [2017-02-17T15:36:18] <felixheck> need the IP of the host in the inside of my application.The idea was to pass the IP dynamically as env into the container
3 [2017-02-17T15:39:45] <SISheogorath> O.o can't you use the containers IP? In genereal you should not need the hosts IP. If you need connections between services you can use docker networks.
4 [2017-02-17T15:42:58] <felixheck> Don't think so :DThe toolkit (seneca/seneca-mesh) uses SWIM as gossip algorithm to build a mesh across multiple maschines.They suggest to use--net=host. So it's the host ip what I need, isn't it? It's quite confusing. I'm new to docker and it's maybe not the simplest project to start with :D
5 [2017-02-17T16:43:19] <SISheogorath> jyapujuju: check your working directory
6 [2017-02-17T16:43:37] <SISheogorath> (in your container)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-17T16:28:24] <jyapujuju> docker-compose run web rake db:setup\nNo Rakefile found (looking for: rakefile, Rakefile, rakefile.rb, Rakefile.rb)

2 [2017-02-18T00:30:24] <killerspaz> felixheck: hey, fellow seneca user, and about to tackle the mesh myself. However, from my knowledge of both,net=hostis probably not needed, just the containers that need external access to have ports exposed so they CAN be reached by the public IP
3 [2017-02-18T00:31:21] <killerspaz> i have APIs built that are exposed on various ports, running on the default 10101 and 8080, but the 8080 is mapped to specific ports of our choosing

1 [2017-02-18T03:45:06] <scheung38> Is there Windows container for Docker thanks, need to run Wins apps on my Mac
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-18T04:17:39] <SISheogorath> There are Windows Containers, but they only run on Windows. As docker is a container runtime environment it uses a shared kernel. And this doesn't work for Windows on a non-windows platform. In case of Linux containers on Windows or Mac there is a VM running in background but you can imagine that this is not possible for Windows Containers for license reasons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-18T11:38:48] <vatsalparekh> any docker-compose contributer here? need help in codebase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-18T17:05:31] <killerspaz> scheung38: docker isn't virtualization, so that's not possible without some proxy to a daemon within a virtual machine running windows (how docker-toolbox works on windows/osx to communicate to a VM running linux)

3 [2017-02-19T06:50:26] <vito-c> is there a way to find out how much space is allocated to my images
4 [2017-02-19T07:50:05] <felixheck> docker Images?
5 [2017-02-19T12:32:27] <felixheck> Cause it should be a string ('...')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-19T10:12:23] <sandys> is there a way to get docker secrets during build time ? for example to access a private git repo?

5 [2017-02-19T12:43:55] <madpipeline> and I should encapsulate the whole thing in quotes?
6 [2017-02-19T12:44:06] <madpipeline> or just the container path??
7 [2017-02-19T12:44:17] <madpipeline> felixheck: ^

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-19T14:17:28] <felixheck> Why is there a bunch of whitespace between host and container definition?

1 [2017-02-19T14:30:08] <jyapujuju> my files are locked after docker-compose build ...
2 [2017-02-19T14:30:13] <jyapujuju> what to do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-19T15:03:27] <SISheogorath> sandys: no, docker secrets are swarm mode only and images are never build using swarm mode. I would suggest you to use git submodule or got subtree in your Repository and simply useADDorCOPY.  Never use secrets during build. There is no way to keep them secret right now
2 [2017-02-19T15:05:03] <SISheogorath> vito-c: in case you run docker 1.13 or higher:docker system df

2 [2017-02-20T06:38:24] <4406arthur> gadget_mnky_twitter: in my point of view, I thought cross node communicate depends on build-in LoadBalancing ? Thats why I wonder is there a probability use container’s ip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-20T06:23:24] <gadget_mnky_twitter> hey@4406arthurwould be keen on taking a look at your solution as well (we are dealing with a similar problem stmt)…care to oss if permitted ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-20T14:07:33] <seltsam23> Whats the docker-compose equivalent to CMD from the dockerfile? What is setup in CMD is executed like its typed into the command line, right? Is it executed form the workpath, or the root of the container?
2 [2017-02-20T14:10:07] <SISheogorath> seltsam23: it'scommandand it is handled likeCMD
3 [2017-02-20T14:11:28] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: ok, so command heaves exactly the same like cmd and overrides it, correct?
4 [2017-02-20T14:11:32] <seltsam23> *behaves
5 [2017-02-20T14:11:53] <SISheogorath> So in general if there is a entrypoint scriptCMDprovides it's parameter. In case of no entrypoint script it is placed after default shell. In general that should be/bin/sh -c
6 [2017-02-20T14:12:13] <SISheogorath> Yes it overwrite it
7 [2017-02-20T14:12:37] <seltsam23> ok, is that the point where i run my app? like "npm start" "nodemon" pm2 start ..." ?
8 [2017-02-20T14:12:51] <SISheogorath> Yes
9 [2017-02-20T14:12:56] <seltsam23> excellent
10 [2017-02-20T14:14:15] <seltsam23> so this should work? [<-CODE->]
11 [2017-02-20T14:15:07] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: you can connect to Containers by their IP by first lookuptasks.<servicename>and use the results.
12 [2017-02-20T14:16:38] <SISheogorath> seltsam23: you should addCMDas JSON array instead of normal string. In this case you don't use the default shell and avoid possible problems.
13 [2017-02-20T14:17:14] <SISheogorath> See the officialCMDreference in the docs and also best practices
14 [2017-02-20T14:17:30] <seltsam23>  [<-CODE->]
15 [2017-02-20T14:17:43] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: Yeah, thats where i spent the last hour
16 [2017-02-20T14:19:09] <SISheogorath> ["pm2", "start",  "./bin/www"]
17 [2017-02-20T14:19:41] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: Ah, i see. And this is executed in the workdir, correct?
18 [2017-02-20T14:19:50] <SISheogorath> Yes
19 [2017-02-20T14:21:45] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: This errors like this: "starting container process caused "exec: \\"pm2 start\\": executable file not found in $PATH"just using "CMD nodemon" works flawless though
20 [2017-02-20T14:22:01] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: sounds broken, not sure what you do in your setup.
21 [2017-02-20T14:22:18] <SISheogorath> seltsam23: maybe use the absolute path to pm2
22 [2017-02-20T14:24:40] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: maybe try it on play-with-docker.com there the environment should be fine
23 [2017-02-20T14:27:07] <SISheogorath> Ah nice have fun while debugging ;)
24 [2017-02-20T14:30:02] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: Thanks mate, now its working!
25 [2017-02-20T14:32:21] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-20T14:08:35] <kschlesselmann> jyapujuju: chown set the file ownership. Apprently you don't have a group like$USER. Just pick some other group that's appropriate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-20T14:20:33] <4406arthur> SISheogorath: ,  thank your respond, but I found Its blocked by my iptables, I modify my iptable  Foward/Input  accept 10.0.0.0/24 (default overlay subnetwork), now I can use Service Name across node, but still can’t direcly use container’s ip

1 [2017-02-20T15:14:07] <sn00pster> Hi guys, I have a slightly strange issue with docker.  I have used the linux binaries to create a synology SPK package with the latest docker and it\'s all working fine....  Except, when I do "docker top <container>" I get no processes listed as running.  If I do a "ps axjf" on the host I can see the docker containers and the child processes running (all the containers are working correctly).
2 [2017-02-20T15:14:22] <sn00pster> Any thoughts on where I should begin to look for the cause of this?

3 [2017-02-21T12:29:18] <daniel-halito> But the problem is that my container exits by itself
4 [2017-02-21T12:29:34] <daniel-halito> Probably because php-cli is not running a daemon

1 [2017-02-21T14:45:16] <tulpn> Hi guys, I have a few questions, as I am just starting with docker and I am a bit confused after the books, tutorials and whatever else I read. A lot of infos to get into.... At the moment we are working with vagrant to be as close to the server arch as possible. What we want to do is get rid of our monolith system and move to a microservice structure. From what I read each line in the docker config will create a new hash for a layer, therefore it is better to get a base container where all the apt stuff is done, all dependencies are created etc and use that as a FROM for the actuall app deployment container, where I only have to copy the app pretty much. This would also speed up the deployment as far as I am concerned since no heavy installs need to be done. But how does the actual deployment work ? I am developing on my vagrant vm, do my git commits etc and at some point I say we can deploy a new version. Would a git pull be in the docker file ? Is the vhost configuration within the docker instance or will it use the webserver from the host system the docker container runs from ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-21T15:02:43] <sopanshewale> soapoperator: - i am sorry, i missed your comment. I was away from gitter long time. let me know if anything i need to catch?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-21T15:36:41] <verwilst> by default when you do docker login your.own.registry, it tries to connect to port 443 it seems. I think it looks ugly to specify docker login your.own.registry:5000
2 [2017-02-21T15:36:59] <verwilst> should i just run the registry on port 443 then instead of 5000?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-21T15:44:37] <SISheogorath> tulpn: I could explain the whole thing but it would take me long time as I am on a smartphone. I recommend you to read the user guide in the docs [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-02-21T15:46:06] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: you can run the reverse proxy on your host but I would recommend you to run it in a container too. Make a lot things easier. The mentioned images are both for containers
3 [2017-02-21T15:46:14] <verwilst> yes! 443:5000 works!
4 [2017-02-21T15:48:54] <SISheogorath> felyx: you should mount a tmpfs or ramdisk via docker run, not inside the container
5 [2017-02-21T15:51:41] <SISheogorath> daniel-halito: in worst case use a bash script as wrapper and restart what ever you want to keep. Not sure what's the point of running something with the php-cli and don't want to get the container exited. In general think about the fact that should not have any persistent data in your container
6 [2017-02-21T15:52:45] <SISheogorath> pgrekovich: the current, official recommendation is docker for Windows. But it maybe depends on your use case
7 [2017-02-21T15:54:12] <SISheogorath> Docker for Windows is recommended because it's better integrated and able to run Windows Containers if you want (have to switch to Windows container mode)
8 [2017-02-21T15:54:56] <SISheogorath> The toolbox is maybe better for people already running VM in virtualbox and want don't need Windows containers
9 [2017-02-21T15:55:20] <SISheogorath> As long as both develop Linux containers that is no problem
10 [2017-02-21T15:55:34] <SISheogorath> But keep an eye on your line endings ;)
11 [2017-02-21T15:57:40] <SISheogorath> Maybe you simply use docker-machine ^^
12 [2017-02-21T15:58:30] <pgrekovich> SISheogorath: yeap, thanks for help
13 [2017-02-21T15:58:45] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-21T15:51:32] <pgrekovich> Hi guys. On Windows 10, what better use docker toolbox or native with hyper-v? Why? p.s. sorry for my english.
2 [2017-02-21T15:54:51] <pgrekovich> SISheogorath: ok, but if i'm use docker for Windows, and other guys in team use docker toolbox we will have some problems in future?
3 [2017-02-21T15:57:14] <pgrekovich> SISheogorath: in production we using Linux servers :) i think docker toolbox better way for me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-21T16:03:51] <daniel-halito> SISheogorath: How would you approach it? You have a micro service where no apache/nginx is needed, it just receives and sends commands.
2 [2017-02-21T16:04:51] <SISheogorath> Maybe add awhile 1loop?
3 [2017-02-21T16:05:00] <SISheogorath> Make it a service :D
4 [2017-02-21T16:05:29] <daniel-halito> :)
5 [2017-02-21T16:05:53] <SISheogorath> If you are unable to do that you can letnclisten and push everything incoming to the command :D
6 [2017-02-21T16:06:26] <SISheogorath> (Disclaimer: I'm in love with crazy setups)
7 [2017-02-21T16:06:41] <daniel-halito> I’ve noticed

1 [2017-02-22T06:54:20] <mixer2> good morning. i've a question about docker cache invalidation.in my docker file i have: [<-CODE->] package.json, bower.json and Dockerfile itself are unchanged. for some reason the RUN instruction invalidates the cache, which, as far as i understand shouldn't if the run instruction isn't changed. [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-02-22T06:59:01] <mixer2> and in another container i've nearly the same problem with composer. but in that container it invalidates already the composer.json and composer.lock ADD instructions even if they are unchanged. what is very surprising, because the adding works fine from cache with package.json and bower.json. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-22T09:05:05] <sn00pster> Can anybody come up with an explanation as to why docker is not creating iptable FORWARD rules?  I've just got a default DENY rule and containers can't be accessed, if I do iptables -P FORWARD accept then the containers can be accessed.
2 [2017-02-22T09:05:36] <sn00pster> Normally docker creates FORWARD rules but since reinstallation it's not doing that.  It's creating other rules, just nothing in FORWARD.

1 [2017-02-22T21:35:19] <SISheogorath> @vito-c in general the docker community is a good place to ask. Also the docker forums are good for detailed questions or ideas. Last but not least there is StackExchange where you can ask your question and mark it as a docker question.But you can also ask the question here and maybe someone can help you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-22T21:38:01] <vito-c> Pretty straight forward I'm just trying to get the go libcompose to recognize my private registry: [<-CODE->] but I can see it parsing the auth configs when I added log dumps to the libcompose. There is probably some simple call I am missing?
2 [2017-02-22T21:38:34] <vito-c> when I use just docker-compose it works fine
3 [2017-02-22T21:42:11] <SISheogorath> did you use [<-LINK->] ? There is anauthLookup-object passed
4 [2017-02-22T21:47:20] <vito-c> SISheogorath: ic I am using this one though [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-22T21:48:08] <vito-c> the one I linked should be doing the samething but for all the images in the compose file
6 [2017-02-22T21:51:24] <SISheogorath> I traced it... The project calls pull for each service and each service calls pull for each image...
7 [2017-02-22T21:51:47] <killerspaz> bahhhh, that was 6 hours of wasted fuckin time
8 [2017-02-22T21:51:52] <SISheogorath> Well, that was expected but I'm not completely sure where the configs are get passed
9 [2017-02-22T21:51:56] <killerspaz> all i needed was to restart the daemon :/
10 [2017-02-22T22:05:22] <vito-c> SISheogorath: I think it gets set in the Project struct when I was trying justupit wasn't working and returning an empty auth config object but when I changed it to pull this updated. [<-CODE->]
11 [2017-02-22T22:07:23] <vito-c> SISheogorath: what did you use to trace the call I have intellij setup but it dies when I try to debug
12 [2017-02-22T22:07:47] <SISheogorath> I simply used the docs ^^
13 [2017-02-22T22:07:59] <SISheogorath> and the sourcecode
14 [2017-02-22T22:09:44] <vito-c> k cool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-22T21:44:37] <killerspaz> has anyone had success with dockerized jenkins running docker within? I've volume moutned docker, and from within the container i am able to fully do anything i want with docker, but jenkins is complaining access denied (i'm testing with jenkins user of course).... this was working earlier today just fine, i just restarted all the services due to a non-related service change. now all of a sudden it's access denied non-stop from the jenkins ui (again, inside the container works fine)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-22T22:15:58] <SISheogorath> I'm not a big fan of IDEs ^^ And as I'm not a go programmer...
2 [2017-02-22T22:17:20] <SISheogorath> but it calls it here: [<-LINK->] which calls: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-02-22T22:17:30] <SISheogorath> possibly there is currently an option missing
4 [2017-02-22T22:17:33] <vito-c> yeah I can confer
5 [2017-02-22T22:18:10] <SISheogorath> the lib is marked as experimental :D So not sure if it is a problem of the concept or your usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-22T23:15:23] <vito-c> the lib is also a bit behind the main docker client repo
2 [2017-02-23T02:07:31] <vito-c> SISheogorath: fwiw I added to the existing ticket [<-ISSUE->]

1 [2017-02-23T06:32:56] <ahmadabdullah247> Hi guys I am getting an issue starting docker container,docker start <container-id> command  not working for a stopped container.Connecting via putty from windows [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-23T08:50:45] <tomVeloso> If I conect thought bash to a container and from inside  run the command everithing is fine... but if I try to pass directly the command from outiside
2 [2017-02-23T08:50:50] <tomVeloso> I getlibarpack.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
3 [2017-02-23T09:55:00] <tomVeloso> SISheogorath: how can specify the full path?
4 [2017-02-23T09:57:30] <tomVeloso> I mean how can I say to look in a specify directory?
5 [2017-02-23T10:04:04] <tomVeloso> SISheogorath: ok .. found the solution I need to wrup my command in abash -c
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-23T09:12:01] <SISheogorath> tomVeloso: right working directory?
2 [2017-02-23T09:13:27] <SISheogorath> ahmadabdullah247: The error message tells you the problem. Check that the path to your binary is in$PATHor better use the absolute path.
3 [2017-02-23T09:17:40] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: looks like your config and the parameters are not working together. Not sure which one is higher. Maybe checkout [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-02-23T09:23:40] <ahmadabdullah247> SISheogorath: absolute path worked
5 [2017-02-23T12:35:42] <SISheogorath> tomVeloso: not sure that this is the best solution. Maybe you can check that your Dockerfile follows the docker best practices

1 [2017-02-23T16:18:14] <sbbowers__twitter> Hello, I have muiltiple docker builds that pull out specific things from a monolithic codebase, and hence my build context is large.  I want to use .dockerignore to reduce this context, but I don't know how to ignore things on a per-build basis.  How do I manage ignoring different directories with multiple builds in a repository?
2 [2017-02-23T16:21:16] <sbbowers__twitter> so the only way to solve this problem is through re-structuring the codebase?
3 [2017-02-23T16:22:13] <killerspaz> typically that's the wisest and most maintainable way
4 [2017-02-23T16:22:21] <killerspaz> i wouldn't say the ONLY though
5 [2017-02-23T16:24:11] <killerspaz> alternatively if you want to exclude things, your build system will need to probably dynamically create the .dockerignore file to your desires. But honestly that just sounds like a time bomb waiting to explode
6 [2017-02-23T16:27:57] <sbbowers__twitter> ok. thanks for your suggestions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-23T16:19:42] <killerspaz> maybe instead of ignoring, you include per-build basis?
2 [2017-02-23T16:20:13] <killerspaz> you can accomplish that by segregating files into common and per-build environments, and use env vars to indicate which hierarchy you want to include in the build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-23T20:55:52] <chrismpalmer> Friends! Has anyone had success exporting DISPLAY env variable ? I need to run some python that generates graphs and will need graphics support. I think I'll need Xfvb running?
2 [2017-02-24T01:48:33] <chrismpalmer> SISheogorath: thanks for the reply, yes mount my x session sounds good I didn't know you could do that . Dumb question I assume this is done inside docker container right?
3 [2017-02-24T04:37:53] <chrismpalmer> SISheogorath: thanks !!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-23T21:06:40] <SISheogorath> The DISPLAY ENV var? Why? You can run Xfvb, yes, if you need to run headless. If you run on a desktop machine, you can mount your X session
2 [2017-02-24T03:17:52] <SISheogorath> I never did that before,@chrismpalmer
3 [2017-02-24T03:18:01] <SISheogorath> Maybe checkout [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-02-24T07:58:43] <drahnr> Hi
2 [2017-02-24T07:59:01] <drahnr> I have a bit of an awkward issue regarding container to container connectivity
3 [2017-02-24T08:00:21] <drahnr> whatever I export or publish, I only getConnection refusedwith curl
4 [2017-02-24T08:01:24] <drahnr> full details here: [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-24T08:01:36] <drahnr> it would be awsome if someone could have a look on that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T12:36:00] <jeserkin> Hello guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T12:37:47] <jeserkin> Was wondering whether it is possible after installing machine through existing image somehow further to automate project setup on installed machine. Like git pull repository from github for example. Or any other required task.
2 [2017-02-24T12:39:04] <drahnr> jeserkin: map your project directory in your docker container, that is usually the fastest, maybe put a script in the docker container to allow easy setup if it is a first run
3 [2017-02-24T12:41:26] <jeserkin> map your project directoryWhat exactly do you mean? Kitematic volume setup?
4 [2017-02-24T12:42:13] <drahnr> Not sure what scale you operate on, but-vmight do the job (if the scale is suffiently small)
5 [2017-02-24T12:44:52] <jeserkin> Used this btw [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-02-24T12:45:32] <jeserkin> I am new to Docker and to the way it operates. So sorry in advance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T13:35:36] <jeserkin> Okay, I think I will be able to manage getting files from local system to docker vm at hand. Other question involves additional moves during setup step if it is possible. Is it possible?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T14:04:03] <vyscond> I got huge question here fellas, so i posted here [<-LINK->] to not flood the channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T14:45:01] <SISheogorath> vyscond: I would recommend you to ask this question in [<-LINK->] because it's a setup which possibly needs addition information etc.
2 [2017-02-24T23:19:02] <SISheogorath> jeserkin: in genereal I would recommend [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-02-24T23:20:59] <SISheogorath> But in genereal Docker for Windows and docker for Mac create a VM for running linux containers. But they run all docker commands inside this VM. So the docker image itself is not a VM template. Docker itself uses linux kernel internals to isolate containers. For Windows containers the same applies to windows. In this case docker doesn't run a VM. But I can't say much about windows containers. As it's nothing I use.

1 [2017-02-24T20:23:54] <ryanturner> Hi, I'm having trouble getting docker daemon to connect to the registry. I get the following message when I try docker run hello-world:docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp 54.236.131.143:443: getsockopt: connection refused.
2 [2017-02-24T20:24:27] <ryanturner> When I do a curl of [<-LINK->] I get a json response biody with code UNAUTHORIZED and detail null
3 [2017-02-24T20:25:10] <ryanturner> I don't know how to troubleshoot this; I'm behind a proxy that sometimes reterminates SSL, but I have the root cert installed for the CA that reterminates, and I have the proxy configured on docker
4 [2017-02-24T20:25:34] <ryanturner> and in my curl command at least, the SSL cert that I see is the real rapidssl cert, as if it were e2e and not reterminated.
5 [2017-02-24T20:26:49] <ryanturner> I read something that said that it could be because of an out of sync clock, something related to auth with the registry, but my clock is set appropriately
6 [2017-02-24T20:26:57] <ryanturner> This is on centos 7
7 [2017-02-24T20:30:34] <ryanturner> docker logingives me the same failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T20:32:03] <killerspaz> Hopefully a quick question, I have a service like so: [<-CODE->] And another like so: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-02-24T20:32:41] <killerspaz> ryanturner: what exact command are you running to try hello-world?
3 [2017-02-24T20:38:05] <killerspaz> Problem with dial: dial tcp: lookup mysql on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host. Sleeping 5sis what I keep getting, as if it has no clue where to hit a DNS?
4 [2017-02-24T20:54:13] <killerspaz> hmm... I'm t hinkinghostnamedoesn't actually have an effect on the DNS config, i think it jsut sets the hostname of the container in /etc/hostname
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T22:02:40] <jeserkin> Where should I start in documentation if I'm new to Docker and wish to create own build process, e.g. specify existing image from hub and additional steps like execution of a shell script on resulting VM?
2 [2017-02-24T22:09:05] <jeserkin> Hmmmm. Not sure I'm following. Doesn't Docker automatically create VM entry in either Hyper-V or VirtualBox (e.g. on Windows)?
3 [2017-02-24T22:28:00] <jeserkin> So yeah. In any case question still remains about where to start in docs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T22:05:35] <dragon788> well downloading an image gets you the base, and then you create a Dockerfile that can run additional steps to build a "container", containers != VMs, a VM can emulate other hardware to run the OS, Docker containers require the host OS to have a similar kernel (ie Linux containers on Linux, Windows containers on Windows) though sometimes you can work around this running a container within a VM, but that\'s not a common requirement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-24T23:25:55] <Niko-La> anyone know how to leave an -it container and have it running daemon upon exit from the bash console?
2 [2017-02-24T23:27:04] <SISheogorath> you want to use a docker container likescreen?

6 [2017-02-24T23:38:48] <Niko-La> awesome i was able to bash into the container with exec. now I run "embark simulator" in bash.  now if i press  cntrl c it takes me back to bash in container and exit now means i am back at square one ?

8 [2017-02-24T23:40:26] <Niko-La> i  need that "embark simulator" which is node application to run as 1 terminal and get access to another terminal.  This very easy to do with native docker as u can open up another terminal and docker exec.

3 [2017-02-25T11:37:21] <jonlambert>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-25T19:23:24] <SISheogorath> jonlambert: in your case the Docker engines dependencies conflict with your setup. For some reason you can't install the needed version of a dependency. It's neither wrong with your pins nor with the docker engine package it's simply the combination of the packages installed on your system
2 [2017-02-26T02:35:44] <SISheogorath> in general you can write an entrypoint script, which runs the nodeJS application and then runs a normal bash process
3 [2017-02-26T02:36:10] <SISheogorath> in this case you can replace the CMD with an entrypoint statement
4 [2017-02-26T02:36:18] <SISheogorath> which calls the entrypoint script
5 [2017-02-26T02:40:03] <SISheogorath> use [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T02:42:02] <Niko-La> hi how are you guys getting the code to highlight when pasting in gitter.

5 [2017-02-26T02:45:39] <SISheogorath> That a cert error. NodeJS has some problems with custom certificates
6 [2017-02-26T02:46:26] <SISheogorath> And you use windows lineendings
7 [2017-02-26T02:46:35] <SISheogorath> which is a bad idea as you run a linux container
8 [2017-02-26T02:47:41] <SISheogorath> and maybe use/bin/bashinstead of bash in your entrypoint script
9 [2017-02-26T02:51:10] <SISheogorath> As I said use the full path

11 [2017-02-26T02:53:47] <Niko-La> u added uname -a to the first bash entry as well to see if that runs
12 [2017-02-26T02:58:08] <Niko-La> ya removed all the node and just tried ls command it gave and error for that as well.
13 [2017-02-26T03:06:24] <SISheogorath> you should useexec /bin/bashinstead ofexec bash>.>
14 [2017-02-26T03:06:40] <SISheogorath> that was what I'm saying :D
15 [2017-02-26T03:15:47] <Niko-La> hahaha this is :( it worked once  then not again
16 [2017-02-26T03:16:45] <Niko-La> the one time it worked. it ran the node script then: No such file or directory2: /bin/bash
17 [2017-02-26T03:16:51] <Niko-La> :|
18 [2017-02-26T03:29:26] <Niko-La> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6643152/nodejs-bash-cant-find-nodeseems like i got a head scratcher. thanks for your help
19 [2017-02-26T03:40:39] <Niko-La> ENV NODE_PATH probaly is the issue for bash scriping node commands
20 [2017-02-26T08:01:53] <Niko-La> nice. also ran the srcipt.sh through doc2unix.  Have the node file running fine but  the   exec /bin/bash is not causing the docker comtainer to stay in bash terminal. its exiting :/overall its been a very good day of learning this tech. @SISheogorath much appreciate the time.
21 [2017-02-26T08:11:06] <Niko-La> CMD bash -C '/usr/src/app/boot.sh';'bash'      this works out nicey :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T03:25:47] <SISheogorath> on build run dos2unix on your script to make sure that it uses linux linendings
2 [2017-02-26T03:56:00] <SISheogorath> in this case you should stop calling the entrypoint script in a subshell

1 [2017-02-26T10:13:03] <sandys> hey guys - i deployed a stack using docker swarm and compose.yml. Now, I have updated a few environment variables in my compose.yml. How do I update the service so that it picks up these new environment flags ? updating the service is not picking up the new configuration
2 [2017-02-26T12:01:01] <sandys> Niko-La: i use the full path btw "dumb-init /opt/nodejs/node-v7.5.0-linux-x64/bin/node /oms/server.js" , where dumb-init is a tool that i use for graceful restarts of node.

2 [2017-02-26T12:27:58] <jeserkin> Guys, how can I enable network connection to the internet from docker container
3 [2017-02-26T12:28:27] <jeserkin> So for example my project in container requires files to be downloaded through curl
4 [2017-02-26T12:29:01] <jeserkin> But I'm getting [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-02-26T12:29:27] <jeserkin> ping command is sadly missing as well
6 [2017-02-26T12:30:49] <jeserkin> Sry guys. Seems VPN network somehow conflicted with that. Once it was off, everything was fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T17:17:58] <SISheogorath> sandys: if you make changes in the docker compose file and rerun stack deploy everything should be updated
2 [2017-02-26T21:38:00] <SISheogorath> @jeserkin In genereal it don't have to be on docker hub. Let's see: First of all it highly depends on your configuration but let's asume everything is on default settings from a setup from https://get.docker.com. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Hopefully this helps
3 [2017-02-26T21:38:29] <SISheogorath> (Last hint: In case of port 443 you don't have to specify the port)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T20:39:43] <jeserkin> When one references an image e.g. in commanddocker run ...., then is image a repo at hub.docker.com or do I understand it wrong way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T20:51:39] <racinmat> jeserkin: mostly yes
2 [2017-02-26T20:52:53] <racinmat> jeserkin: or it can be just your own image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T23:34:11] <jeserkin> It did help a bit. My main question would be, what is considered to be an image? e.g. I've created aDockerfileon my system. Can I specify to run it somehow as an image? e.g.docker run /path/to/local/Dockerfile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T23:35:54] <briantyr> jeserkin: : docker build -t image-name:[tagoptional] -f PATH/Dockerfile
2 [2017-02-26T23:36:49] <briantyr> or just exclude  -f PATH/Dockerfile and do "docker build -t image-name ." to build an image.   I think the . should work to show the build context anyway :P
3 [2017-02-26T23:38:12] <briantyr> then type "docker images" to see your "image-name" in the list and you can run a container from that image with "docker run -p host-port:container-port image-name"
4 [2017-02-26T23:38:57] <briantyr> Syntax should more or less be right - I mostly use docker-compose nowadays but you can type docker <CMD> --help to get more help on a command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-26T23:40:50] <racinmat> jeserkin: When you create the Dockerfile, it is like when you write a recipe for an image. Then, you must "cook" this image by using thedocker build. And when the image is built, you can create instances of it a.k.a. containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T00:11:22] <SISheogorath> Docker parts translated to classic schemas:Dockerfile - Source CodeDocker image - Programm (compiled binary)container - ProcessIt's not completely correct but to understand how it works, that's maybe helpful
2 [2017-02-27T00:14:13] <jeserkin> Thank you guys
3 [2017-02-27T00:15:04] <SISheogorath> checkout the getting started docs at [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-02-27T00:18:46] <jeserkin> On this chapter atm [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-27T13:59:58] <SISheogorath> jeserkin: you reference an image withFROM
6 [2017-02-27T14:02:19] <SISheogorath> For Details aboutEXPOSEplease read [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-02-27T14:03:18] <SISheogorath> To have a tagged image you need to add the-tflag to yourdocker buildcommand
8 [2017-02-27T14:04:26] <SISheogorath> seltsam23: you can run an entrypoint script with utilize&like in a regular shell script.
9 [2017-02-27T14:06:29] <SISheogorath> sourcekick: You have an dependency conflict. Depending on your setup you can possibly solve it by uninstalling the conflicting packages. But be aware of the possible problem that this breaks your setup if you don't know what you're doing
10 [2017-02-27T14:31:39] <SISheogorath> No. I'm not sure that it works with array notation
11 [2017-02-27T14:32:37] <SISheogorath> I was thinking about something likenpm run grunt & ; nodemon
12 [2017-02-27T14:33:04] <seltsam23> command:  npm run grunt & ; nodemon
13 [2017-02-27T14:34:06] <SISheogorath> As mentioned placing it in a shell script should work. For command or similar I can't speak
14 [2017-02-27T14:34:31] <seltsam23> I have no experience with shellscripts
15 [2017-02-27T14:34:43] <seltsam23> are they placed next to to the compose-file?
16 [2017-02-27T14:36:28] <SISheogorath> They should placed inside the container and you call them like an executable
17 [2017-02-27T14:39:05] <seltsam23> alright, will look into that, thank you!
18 [2017-02-27T14:53:58] <SISheogorath> Simply uninstallingcontainer-selinux-1.12.5should help

1 [2017-02-27T07:08:32] <476678244> Hi, Can I ask a question about docker-compose? I`m writing docker compose file and how can I make a service as the effect of "docker run -t" to prevent the container exit ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T07:40:11] <comeUpWithItLater> hi , i  just import an image with docker import comand:

3 [2017-02-27T07:41:25] <comeUpWithItLater> but  "$docker-compose up -d  "  doesn\'t use the image i just imported
4 [2017-02-27T07:42:47] <comeUpWithItLater> Hi@476678244,   add me on QQ:1637051798
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T09:30:35] <jeserkin> @SISheogorathhey.  When I writeFROMinDockerfiledoes it mean mean, that I'm referencing only image orDockerfilefrom what image was built?
2 [2017-02-27T10:26:37] <jeserkin> Does it matter whereEXPOSEis located inDockerfile? I am marking, thatEXPOSE 80 443, but in resulting container there are no ports provided out of the box. Only if I add myself.
3 [2017-02-27T12:02:49] <jeserkin> So few questions left from my interaction with Docker. [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T13:47:34] <seltsam23> Is there a way to run two commands in parallel via compose-file command ? Trying to run nodemon and grunt together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T14:02:12] <iosven> I am having a problem updating to docker 1.3 on CentOS 7.3 - added the docker repo to yum andsudo yum install docker-engineyields--> Finished Dependency Resolution\nError: docker-engine conflicts with 2:docker-1.12.5-14.el7.centos.x86_64\nError: docker-engine-selinux conflicts with 2:container-selinux-1.12.5-14.el7.centos.x86_64\n You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem\n You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigestAny hints appreciated.
2 [2017-02-27T15:20:16] <iosven> It worked, however I went with the full uninstall of docker in the following perhaps somewhat "individual" way: [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-02-27T15:21:20] <iosven> Thereafter I didyum -y install docker-engine-1.13.1-1.el7.centos(yum also being completely up to date before this command)
4 [2017-02-27T15:22:08] <iosven> docker-composewas just sitting there unchanged during all this and now just works :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T14:30:13] <seltsam23> SISheogorath: Do you mean like "command: ["nodemon" && "npm run grunt"]" ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T14:52:07] <iosven> SISheogorath: The server is still blank, so I could even uninstall docker engine and then reinstall it. There is one catch, I already also installed docker-compose. Do you think uninstall then install of docker engine would be feasible in this scenario?
2 [2017-02-27T14:52:37] <iosven> The installed docker-compose is the latest release.
3 [2017-02-27T14:57:15] <iosven> Thanks! I am on it now, so far no problems.

1 [2017-02-27T20:39:39] <killerspaz> Anyone run into an issue with a node project wheredocker-composesetup is yielding errors about a node module not found, yet you can run the container manually and it works?
2 [2017-02-27T20:54:32] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->] vs [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-02-27T20:56:26] <killerspaz> should be pretty straightforward
4 [2017-02-27T21:06:37] <killerspaz> not sure how that would solve any problems related to this?
5 [2017-02-27T21:11:12] <killerspaz> it's 100% listed just above... dockerize is the only thing i have added besides node
6 [2017-02-27T21:11:33] <killerspaz> no entrypoint set
7 [2017-02-27T21:11:37] <SISheogorath> Maybe runenvinstead ofnodeto see what environment variables are available
8 [2017-02-27T21:12:04] <SISheogorath> I guess it's aNODE_PATHproblem
9 [2017-02-27T21:12:38] <killerspaz> but it should by default look in the project...
10 [2017-02-27T21:12:46] <killerspaz> also, same env vars when ran from docker vs when i run manually
11 [2017-02-27T21:13:30] <killerspaz>  [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-02-27T21:14:03] <killerspaz> node should be looking innode_modulesin the app root, which it seems to do fine when running manually
13 [2017-02-27T21:14:44] <killerspaz> ahhh my teammate figured it out
14 [2017-02-27T21:14:55] <SISheogorath> What was it?
15 [2017-02-27T21:15:47] <SISheogorath> >.>Makes sense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T20:51:12] <SISheogorath> I'm not completely sure but I would say there is a difference between the run statement and the settings you pass by compose
2 [2017-02-27T21:10:42] <SISheogorath> killerspaz: do you run an entrypoint script or similar?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T21:00:23] <karanhiremath> killerspaz: I’ve had this issue with docker-compose in general before with npm modules. switching to yarn w/ a yarn.lock file solved them for me but I’m not sure what the real issue here is and whether it’s with npm or docker-compose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-27T21:15:21] <killerspaz> silly me, had an ovverride set indocker-compose.override.ymlthat mounted my code as a volume, but since i'm testing build process there's nonode_modulesthus when ran asdocker-composei'm wiping the modules
2 [2017-02-27T21:15:56] <killerspaz> wish i had thought of that sooner
3 [2017-02-28T02:31:48] <killerspaz> docker-machine ip <machine name>will show you the ip addy of your vm
4 [2017-02-28T02:33:17] <killerspaz> docker inspect CONTAINER_IDwill show you a ton of meta-data about the container, specifically which ports are exposed or mapped

2 [2017-02-28T01:13:08] <Niko-La> is there a way to find out which ip it is exposed now on this container?  I have had success with server all containers with ip 192.168.99.100

9 [2017-02-28T03:57:50] <Niko-La> how do i run the container so the embark_demo folder is exposed in my laptop.Also would this work when my container is running the app.  Will I be able to open the index.html this way?

11 [2017-02-28T07:47:44] <Niko-La> nice managed to lick up the volumes. are the changes made to the container folder show up in the host folder in real time and vice-versa?
12 [2017-02-28T07:48:11] <Niko-La> looks like the container is properly networked

2 [2017-02-28T03:48:23] <killerspaz> sorry, maybe i misunderstand your point. As per your question earlier, you should be using whatever daemon you're attached to viadocker-machine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-28T09:47:27] <matrixbot> lanyangyangIs there anyone uses a GUI manager for docker in Linux ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-28T10:40:29] <SISheogorath> langangyang: portainer is a nice GUI manager. Works on all platforms, for everything else I have to say no. I prefer the CLI anyways
2 [2017-02-28T11:27:37] <SISheogorath> Maybe take a look at rancher but notice that it's not pure docker anymore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-28T11:40:41] <sumeshkanayi> I have been trying and found that you cant change the port forwarding /volume mounting etc once the container after it is created
2 [2017-02-28T11:40:50] <sumeshkanayi> is there a way we can achieve this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-28T12:57:42] <SISheogorath> In genereal: If you have a problem with restarting/recreating your containers the image or container is broken. Containers are there to be rebuild.In your special case: You can, but not without a very hacky solution. The hacky solution is using iptables to rewrite your ports

1 [2017-02-28T18:02:23] <racinmat> Hello, I tinkered with GUI applications in docker. I have some app for simulations and it just needs the GUI. when I want to run simulations in it.But this required for example X server running elsewhere in the time it runs.I want to deploy the simulations for example to AWS, and I just want to send the GUI to dev/null or omething like that. Is there any option to "mock" the GUI output in docker do the app in docker whinks it has GUI, but just runs without GUI in container in AWS or somewhere?
2 [2017-02-28T20:04:15] <racinmat> dragon788: so I can have one image with GUI app for simulations and the other image with xvfb as the X server? The xvfb does the X server to which app can connect, but does not output anything? So it can happily run anywhere in the cloud, without any monitor and the GUI app does not notice? Neat, thanks!
3 [2017-02-28T20:04:57] <dragon788> you could either run the Xvfb in the same container with your app or run it as a separate "linked" container running the Xorg/Xvfb server
4 [2017-02-28T20:13:45] <racinmat> dragon788: this is exactly what I needed, thanks
5 [2017-03-01T12:19:06] <racinmat> I do not think using docker is cheaper for one app than running the app directly on machine. But if you want your app scalable, docker is cheaper than dedicated machine, because you pay only for what you actually use and with docker on properly configured cloud service is not the same problem as.with dedicated server where you pay for machine to be online during the peak but big part is completely unused big part of time when the load is not so big.
6 [2017-03-01T12:46:00] <racinmat> yes. But the docker also has other advantages. It enables smoother deployment process and is almost necessary to continuous integration. In dockerized app, it is also easier to run it for new developer in team, because there is noo need to install db, interpreter and so on, just docker and download image. So it may lead to easier development and thus should lower some price of development. But this is ptobably  little bit another topic than you asked.
7 [2017-03-01T14:19:39] <racinmat> joshbedo: which kind of authorization is in your mind?
8 [2017-03-01T20:01:07] <dragon788> I think maybe if you run with--net hostyou can do this, but I haven't tested that
9 [2017-03-01T20:01:14] <dragon788> jdevillard: ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-02-28T19:38:42] <dragon788> xvfb
2 [2017-02-28T19:38:50] <dragon788> is the older package for a virtual X server
3 [2017-02-28T19:38:55] <dragon788> there is a newer one that always slips my mind
4 [2017-02-28T19:40:05] <dragon788>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-02-28T19:40:24] <dragon788> ahh, Xpra is the newer option, with XDummy that uses a dummy driver for the actual Xorg server
6 [2017-02-28T19:40:30] <dragon788> if you are using a headless install Xvfb may be easier
7 [2017-02-28T19:40:38] <dragon788> Xephyr is another option
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-01T12:08:17] <joshbedo> Hey everyone, is docker really cheaper than running an app on an instance? I keep seeing posts sayings its cheaper but nobody really explains why or how. I'm starting a new business and looking for a cost effective way to get it going.
2 [2017-03-01T12:27:19] <joshbedo> The docker hardware for say Microsoft Azure or AWS isn't more expensive to run than a non-containerized app? excluding the registry cost of course.
3 [2017-03-01T12:28:25] <joshbedo> Just trying to make sure i don't get in over my head. I've used docker at larger corporations who have the funding i'm just wondering if it's a cost effective option for a startup.
4 [2017-03-01T12:29:58] <joshbedo> Oh sorry@racinmatmissed your message.. it's early here :D
5 [2017-03-01T12:33:05] <joshbedo> racinmat: yeah thats what i was kind of thinking. It pays off with higher amounts of traffic but on a new site with no traffic it probably won't.
6 [2017-03-01T12:50:49] <joshbedo> racinmat: No thats great! I like thinking about different perspectives and trade-offs.
7 [2017-03-01T14:06:17] <joshbedo> What is a good way to handle authorization with docker?
8 [2017-03-01T14:46:10] <joshbedo> I was planning on using JWT Tokens i'm using Node.JS
9 [2017-03-01T15:15:13] <joshbedo> But i'm open to other suggestions i'm just curious on the best way to handle it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-01T12:25:11] <gadget_mnky_twitter> I would like to think running docker is cheaper when you have multiple components in a given service

1 [2017-03-01T18:16:31] <jdevillard> hello all! I'm using Docker on windows (beta 17) , using Linux Container, and I would like to configure my container to use a host proxy to be able to analyse traffic using fiddler on my host
2 [2017-03-01T18:16:38] <jdevillard> is anyone already done this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-01T20:53:26] <ioleo>  [<-CODE->] I've read many blog posts about diffrent techniques, but some of them are outdates and I'm confused (none of them worked so far for me, or maybe I made some mistakes).
2 [2017-03-01T20:53:44] <ioleo> Is there a good solution to this problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-01T21:30:05] <dragon788> not sure if there is a good way other than having the containers chown or chmod it, or create a container with an attached volume that changes the permission and then simply use-volumes-frominstead of a separate named volume
2 [2017-03-01T22:50:58] <dragon788> I've only really seen it done in the run or as part of a script that runs as the default entrypoint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-01T21:41:40] <ioleo> dragon788: other than having the containers chown or chmod itlike this? [<-CODE->]

1 [2017-03-02T16:56:59] <tulpn> Hi everyone, I am currently trying to setup docker-compose for local development with 2 services (just to get the understanding), I have a django app and nginx running. The nginx part is working fine. However,  the django project files are not getting into the container.  Thedocker-compose logscommand leaves me with a[Error 2] No such file or directoryMy docker-compose.yml looks as followed: [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-03-02T17:00:18] <tulpn> I was going over " [<-LINK->] " to get an understanding for the volume configurations.

1 [2017-03-03T19:39:47] <verwilst> let's say i have an index.php i want to run in docker-compose. How would i do that? Create a datacontainer that has the index.php, then link a php-fpm and a httpd container to it?
2 [2017-03-03T20:07:13] <verwilst> kschlesselmann: with a shared volume you mean?
3 [2017-03-03T20:07:30] <verwilst> or create a custom httpd and php container for each project?
4 [2017-03-03T20:07:42] <verwilst> that will get you A LOT of containers though :-)
5 [2017-03-03T20:08:04] <kschlesselmann> verwilst: I'm not sure what you're going to do but basically yeah: Pack your app in containers.
6 [2017-03-03T20:08:42] <verwilst> just want to get it right conceptually
7 [2017-03-03T20:08:54] <verwilst> and what if i put the code on a shared volume on the host?
8 [2017-03-03T20:09:32] <verwilst> or volumes_from ?
9 [2017-03-03T20:09:32] <kschlesselmann> That's fine too. I did that with an app here as well. IMHO just a little more complicated though
10 [2017-03-03T20:10:59] <kschlesselmann> You should play around a little and find out what works best for you. I'd advise to automate the build process though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-03T20:05:26] <kschlesselmann> verwilst: Yeah, for example. Another approach would be to include the index.php in both containers.

1 [2017-03-03T23:01:46] <tulpn> Hey guys, I have been using docker-compose to build up a service which runs fine. Its there to serve me in development with a MySQL (official), Nginx (alpine official) and a web (our custom) service. We work with django and have a medium sized app. However, during development the requests become super slow. Its almost like the system has to wakeup first. Does anyone have an idea what might cause this? Lets say, when I test something on the website everything is fine,  then I leave the window and  read something for 2 minutes. When I then go back and refresh the page, that is served from my docker, it takes like 20 seconds until I see something happening. I develop on windows 10 pro with hyper-v, i76900k, 64gb ram -> allocated 4cpu/4gb in the docker settings (also confirmed in hyperv)

1 [2017-03-03T23:49:21] <sawhney_ankur_twitter> Hey,a simple question. I intend to create a docker file to install Oracle jdk8 but everytime I keep failing at trying to install the webupd8 ppa for java silently. Any ideas ?

3 [2017-03-04T02:04:58] <sawhney_ankur_twitter> SISheogorath: ubuntu. I googled. I was asked to manually type the docker file in case some unseen characters were causing problems. Didn't change anyhing
4 [2017-03-04T02:53:57] <sawhney_ankur_twitter> SISheogorath: I will type the exact error in a few hours...4sure. Thanx for helping. Hwever, in short, the error said that webup8 repo for java not found. One user suggested I install shared-common pack before this in which case I started getting the error that that pack wasn't found. None of these statements give error when I execute them manually on same machine. They ask for password. Kindly note here that the user already has admin privileges and I am generally able to execute all sudoku commands without adding 'sudo' from dockerfile
5 [2017-03-04T05:37:59] <sawhney_ankur_twitter> SISheogorath: thanx a lot . I went ahead with openjdk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-04T01:10:53] <SISheogorath> tulpn: Maybe check the the RAM usage and swapping of your system. I'm not sure how well HyperV works with high RAM usage and I/O for MySQL. There are many reasons why it works like it works right now :/
2 [2017-03-04T01:12:46] <SISheogorath> sawhney_ankur_twitter: what base image are you using?
3 [2017-03-04T02:45:37] <SISheogorath> Can you share the error message?
4 [2017-03-04T03:28:15] <SISheogorath> I tried to reproduce the issue and think I found the problem. It's the fact that the installer needs a confirmation to process. This can't work with docker build.
5 [2017-03-04T03:28:49] <SISheogorath> Maybe search for a better way to install Oracle Java

1 [2017-03-04T17:51:44] <tulpn> Is there a best practice guide on how to organise a private AWS docker repository ? Does it make sense to store both dev and prod containers ? Should they be in different repos ? Or should the version tag be different, for instance with a -dev appended? There should be a online test env and a prod env, in both cases though the env should define a bool DEBUG flag. However, when developing locally should the same repos be used / referenced ? I am a bit confused in that regards - my end goal would be to COPY the source code into a docker container for a webapp and not use git or anything like that. in addition the source code directory needs to be shared between the containers.
2 [2017-03-05T20:37:32] <tulpn> SISheogorath: thanks for your detailed answer! I will need to think and fully understand it, before I can practically do that. But its a good starting point

5 [2017-03-05T08:28:20] <cristim> your images may have multiple layers, each layer gets a subvolume

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-05T08:27:24] <cristim> I think that's how the btrfs storage driver works, you can only get rid of those if you delete all your images and containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-05T13:55:10] <SISheogorath> tulpn: I personally wouldn\'t store all dev images in the private registry. Registry tend to use a lot of storage fastly depending on your images it can escalate quickly. Everything you deploy to test environments should already be "stable" as you want to use the same image in production. It should also build by a CI. So use an optimized Dockerfile for this. For development on local machine I would recommend you to use an build-cache optimized image which has small Delta and allows you to rebuild your image very fast, but don\'t share them. Keep your code tested with unit and integration tests. In general you should store your images in the same repo, as they are the same software (or would you use another git repository for your dev version? O.o) you can tag them as-devsuffix as it is useful togrepfor those versions. Also I\'m not sure why you need multiple containers of the same codebase. Easiest way is prepare a base image for your code/binaries and then a new image with this base to have your special versions. This way you don\'t have the need to copy your sources multiple times. In general just as hint of you want to serve static content from another container: use a HTTP cache (nginx/varnish) instead of an own container for those files. (Reason: you don\'t have to keep track of both containers/services to be in sync)
2 [2017-03-05T20:53:07] <SISheogorath> jaksky: what kind of stream are you talking about? Docker logs? Network?
3 [2017-03-05T20:56:41] <SISheogorath> tulpn: I hope so :D I should write a lot more blog entries to answer all those things :D
4 [2017-03-08T05:17:00] <SISheogorath> Only the lastHEALTHCHECKstatement is used. So if you define one in your image the one from the base image is obsolete

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-07T19:46:14] <killerspaz> you stored the private key on the internal container?
2 [2017-03-07T19:46:30] <killerspaz> and permissions are set right on.ssh/*?
3 [2017-03-07T19:46:54] <killerspaz> Permission info: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-03-07T19:50:32] <brianveltman> killerspaz: Yes. Although windows does not handle permissions the same way Unix does.
5 [2017-03-07T19:54:39] <killerspaz> inside the container it's linux, your dockerfile should do some permission changes on it if you're building in windows
6 [2017-03-07T19:55:20] <killerspaz> i assume you're copying something during the build? like the key(s)?
7 [2017-03-08T05:32:34] <killerspaz> brianveltman: right, i'm suggesting that the copy is copying with 777 or 755, i forget what the windows default is... and the user is probably the right user, but since permissions aren't right, it won't work... I would do some chmod's in your dockerfile to set them on build... i haven't done that on hyper-v but i have on virtualbox with boot2linux
8 [2017-03-08T05:35:34] <killerspaz> quick quetion for the room... docs ( [<-LINK->] ) sayIf the path /webapp already exists inside the container’s image, the /src/webapp mount overlays but does not remove the pre-existing content... however when i attach a volume, the files go away... not exactly what I expect in "overlay" of a mount.... anyone done something like this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-07T20:21:24] <brianveltman> killerspaz: The docker engine runs on Windows server 2016, during the build I copy the public key of the docker engine and sshd_config to the container.

1 [2017-03-08T00:51:06] <rcjsuen> Correct to say thatHEALTHCHECK NONEwill disable health checks from the base image as well as the base image's base image and so on and so forth? AllHEALTHCHECKinstructions in the chain will be disabled, correct?

1 [2017-03-08T06:50:50] <soapoperator> Hello, anybody use traefik as proxy?I try to use a custom configuration with traefik.toml... But the file seems to be skipped. It's not a permission issue. Any idea?My docker-compose file: [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-03-08T06:52:40] <soapoperator> Where can i find the log? I can't connect into the container with bash...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-08T07:56:01] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: if/bin/bashis not working try/bin/shbut in general I'm sure Traefik doesn't ignore the config file. Also I would suggest you to kill the config file and place everything as parameter using thecommandstatement. Anyways the log is placed where it is placed by any good containerized application in thestdoutIf you miss something higher the log level. All this is also available in the Traefik documentations.
2 [2017-03-08T07:56:31] <SISheogorath> Last but not least I see no reason to label the Traefik container itself
3 [2017-03-09T03:22:44] <SISheogorath> tulpn: that are unnamed volumes (bad habit of compose v1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-08T19:47:42] <toftware> I have installed Docker for windows. Do you have a good guide for how to bridge the windows host and linux host so they are linked and they can resolve from eachother?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T00:05:58] <tulpn> Still learning docker, [<-LINK->] in the web service where do the volumes get mounted ? or are that the destinations ? if so what is the source ? the ./web folder ? In other words, does the ./web folder get mounted as /usr/src/app ? Why 2 times with /usr/src/app/static ? so that the nginx can access it as well ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T05:16:19] <soapoperator> SISheogorath: Thank you for your answer. It put me on the right way. I finaly notice,  either we use command and flags or we use traefix.toml. But both don't work together...
2 [2017-03-09T05:50:48] <soapoperator> finaly incomand, it doesn't find the flagweb.auth.basic.users. So the solution .toml could be more robust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T14:02:19] <tulpn> When working with docker on windows, I am not able to delete files that were created during the runtime of a container. For instance, I am using Django, and the py files become compiled pyc files. Some of them cannot be deleted, unless I restart the computer. Has anyone run into the problem and how can I solve that in more developer friendly way ?

1 [2017-03-09T14:26:55] <LoiKos> Hi, I'm new to docker community and I have an issue with Kitematic, I want to install it but I wish I could do it without the docker toolbox because I work with docker Mac native app. Is there a way to achieve that ?
2 [2017-03-09T15:03:26] <LoiKos> BretFisher: thank for your answer... I use Brew but I didn't know cask for brew it look amazing. Do you think I should reinstall docker Mac app with brew too ?
3 [2017-03-09T15:08:32] <LoiKos> ok nice too bad for update maybe it will be coming ... yeah easier way when u have plenty to install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T14:42:32] <saifulhoque26> Hi All,
2 [2017-03-09T14:44:26] <saifulhoque26> Is it possible to map node\'s device (usbport ) to a service?Similar to "docker create --device=/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0".I am starting on a specific node, using --constraint.Greetings.In reference I could not find.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T14:56:06] <BretFisher> LoiKos: yes, do you use brew? two ways, either click in DforMac menu bar and click Kitematic and it'll download a zip, or you canbrew cask install kitematic
2 [2017-03-09T15:02:51] <BretFisher> saifulhoque26: if you're talking about swarm, I don't think so yet, see [<-ISSUE->] but if you're doing justdocker runthen sure
3 [2017-03-09T15:03:41] <BretFisher> naw
4 [2017-03-09T15:03:52] <BretFisher> cask is just a easy way to install .app's the first time
5 [2017-03-09T15:03:57] <BretFisher> but the app themselves has to update
6 [2017-03-09T15:04:03] <BretFisher> there is no brew cask update, etc
7 [2017-03-09T15:04:56] <BretFisher> but i do put a bunch ofbrew cask installs in mymacbuild.shfor when i get a new machine.  have dozens of open source .app that it installs
8 [2017-03-09T16:12:57] <jMonsinjon> racinmat: I don't think so...
9 [2017-03-09T16:13:11] <jMonsinjon> Maybe you should make yours
10 [2017-03-09T16:14:04] <jMonsinjon> And every time you find a missing package, you install it in your base image for the next time

1 [2017-03-09T15:36:17] <racinmat> Hi, I am using docker to run many linux-only programs, and not for developing web apps.Therefore, I got stuck many times because the canonical ubuntu image, from which are most docker images, is minimal, does not have vim, nano, file, software-properties-common, and many, many other libraries.I know the main use of docker is for web apps where you ust have git, web server, interpreter and that is mainly everything and you do not need anything else.But for my purpose, everytime I try to run some software, I got stuck for many hours because of some missing library (because the program simply does not say it is missing library, it simply crashes).This is very tiring, and I would like to avoid it in the future.So I am asking here, is there any docker image with ubuntu with libraries more close to classicla desktop ubuntu rather than minimal image used mostly in docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T17:09:52] <saifulhoque26> BretFisher: I was talking about swarm. While creating a service. Your answer is exactly what I was asking. Thanks. I am checking the issue.

1 [2017-03-09T21:15:18] <killerspaz> Anyone run into this problem? (Can't connect via hostname) [<-ISSUE->] Works fine on Docker 1.13 on Linux/Windows, but won't resolve the hostname with dockerize on RancherOS. Feels really strange.
2 [2017-03-09T23:32:29] <killerspaz> it will never delete them, currently GC only removes from db
3 [2017-03-10T02:13:04] <killerspaz> i usually go manually delete it after gc
4 [2017-03-10T02:13:18] <killerspaz> then rebuild anything i want back
5 [2017-03-10T02:13:24] <killerspaz> docker is kinda messy still
6 [2017-03-10T03:57:52] <killerspaz> sorry, i meant to say private registry is, not necessarily docker itself
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T21:46:20] <dlwhitehurst> Can someone recommend an architecture where I have a Spring-Boot/Angular WAR (Tomcat embedded) where I can economically host each WAR with a 1GB VM? E.g. I know that it will run on a t2.micro with MariaDB but I'm looking to do automated hosting and deployment. I'm here because I think Docker might be my solution.
2 [2017-03-09T22:15:09] <dlwhitehurst> rbuckland: I can define the resource needs for my web app with tools that are already built in, mem, heap, stack, JVM stuff. And, since I do everything but create the database schema now, I need to consider the database requirements and probably build a database instance (server) to be scalable. I don't think the individual web apps will need to scale because the user count (obtaining sessions) will be low. I'm trying to offer a private hosting per client (unique URL) economically. And, I'm an application architect but the cloud infrastructure consideration is new to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T21:58:06] <rbuckland> Docker will work for you@dlwhitehurst. But bear in mind .. Everything about your resource footprint is entirely in your Java app. Docker is a control group around processes that run on the host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-09T23:27:38] <smashingx1> I ran the Garbage Collector for Docker registry and it's sowhing me this: 12530 blobs marked, 0 blobs eligible for deletion
2 [2017-03-09T23:27:57] <smashingx1> but it's not deleting any image, any ideas why this might be happening?
3 [2017-03-09T23:55:41] <smashingx1> killerspaz: so how can I get back hard drive space?
4 [2017-03-09T23:56:29] <smashingx1> killerspaz: I was getting out of space errors every time I wanted to build a new image. So I need to get space back

1 [2017-03-10T14:19:39] <iDVB> Anyone have issues with getting AWS to pull from private DockerHub registry? (Err:  CannotPullContainerError) This is a piece of our Dockerrun.aws.json (works with ECR and fails when I change to DockerHub)… [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]

3 [2017-03-10T14:41:41] <iDVB> sigh….. worst docs ever...
4 [2017-03-10T14:42:17] <iDVB> Elastic Beanstalk currently requires the older ~/.dockercfg format configuration file. To convert a config.json file, remove the outer auths key and flatten the JSON document to match the old format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T17:20:57] <smashingx1> killerspaz: you say you delete what after gc?
2 [2017-03-10T17:24:03] <killerspaz> the blobs for the specific image
3 [2017-03-10T17:24:21] <smashingx1> yes but the one that actually deletes the blows is the GC
4 [2017-03-10T17:24:33] <smashingx1> you can only soft delete the blobs
5 [2017-03-10T17:25:11] <killerspaz> You didn't read what I said.... I said AFTER a GC, i manually delete the blobs.
6 [2017-03-10T17:25:26] <killerspaz> rmis mostly permanent, not soft.
7 [2017-03-10T17:26:34] <smashingx1> yes I did read it but I'm confused about what you are saying because the one that actually deletes the blobs is the GC
8 [2017-03-10T17:27:33] <smashingx1> or just to understand what you do to clean up your registry is: you soft delete the images, then run the GC and then you delete the blobs with rm? Am I missing something?
9 [2017-03-10T17:37:33] <killerspaz> sometimes i get lazy and just delete the entire image and say screw it, then GC
10 [2017-03-10T17:37:41] <killerspaz> then rebuild whatever tags i want
11 [2017-03-10T17:38:11] <killerspaz> i'm not suggesting i have the best workflow for that :P just more a comment on how sloppy docker registry is atm
12 [2017-03-10T17:38:42] <killerspaz> only pain is the one image that takes over an hour to compile :/
13 [2017-03-10T17:39:22] <smashingx1> yes, I understand you. At this point I don't know what to do. There's no documentation about the problem I'm having. It's really bad because we need this server running again, and I can't find information anywhere :(
14 [2017-03-10T18:37:43] <smashingx1> killerspaz: the registry is in a docker container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T17:24:36] <pabloocastro> ancashoria: Is your docker daemon running?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T18:01:18] <killerspaz> vforsythe: what is your env like... is the registry hosted on the same physical volume as your build system?
2 [2017-03-10T18:01:28] <killerspaz> for us it is.... so we prune and delete frequently
3 [2017-03-10T18:07:04] <ancashoria> pabloocastro: it's running, the mongo container is accessible through robomongo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T19:02:43] <soapoperator> Hello, any idea to add basic authetification to an app running with the docker image php:7.1-apache? To i have to pass it  through dockerfile or is it possible with label or command?
2 [2017-03-10T20:12:19] <soapoperator> SISheogorath: Thank you for your answer. I start to use traefik. As far as i know, traefik give some auth basic opportunity for the backend or entrypoint but not for frontend? And i run multi container which are exposed on port 80.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T20:01:11] <pabloocastro> ancashoria: Have you exposed the container on this port?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T20:07:39] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: I used a simple container in front of it. If you use Traefik you can simply use it to do this.  Otherwise there is the possibility to use one of those nginx images which are laying around on docker hub and provide basic auth
2 [2017-03-10T22:22:21] <SISheogorath> soapoperator: maybe check [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-03-10T22:24:26] <SISheogorath> bitsofinfo: possibly you should try to use go templates. Not sure if it's possible for environment variables. I should read the sources related to this later. If you can edit the container maybe simply use the hostname
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T20:55:06] <bitsofinfo> I would like to create a docker service and scale it to 3 instances. These 3 instances form a cluster, and each one of the containers needs one of its arguments to have a unique valuedocker run  -e "UNIQUE_ID=[something unique]"  myimageHow can I do this w/ swarm services?
2 [2017-03-10T22:49:25] <bitsofinfo> hmm so this, how can I have swarm service create seed a unique value for a placeholder? Seems like there should be some sort of ability to do this kind of thing no? Problem is this is not docker run, so i have no access to the actual invocation that starts the containerdocker service create --replicas 3 --name myapp -e "UNIQUE_ID=[uniqueVal]" myimage -myarg1 [uniqueVal]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-10T20:59:57] <killerspaz> vforsythe: but how do images get into it, is it built in another container on that system or just pushed by a dev? I ask, because there may be layers in your daemon that could be pruned as well. I typically clear up anywhere between 30-100GB/day on our build system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26 [2017-03-12T19:10:56] <ioleo> One VM is for my general development (it's where I keep InteliJ and all my projects) <-- this is where I run docker images
27 [2017-03-12T19:11:34] <ioleo> Another VM is for workshops - I don't want to pollute my regular working environment with all the libs I have to install during workshops

1 [2017-03-12T21:22:30] <SISheogorath> mateomorrison: as far as I know running meteor in docker is not recommended if you want to do that maybe check how rocket.chat does it. Anyways, to run commands inside a running container usedocker exec <containerid> <command>
2 [2017-03-12T21:25:55] <mateomorrison> What do I put on <command>?@SISheogorath

1 [2017-03-13T16:35:24] <joeyciechanowicz> I was wondering if anyone could quickly tell me if running a VPN inside of docker isolates the VPN? So could one use docker to run one process through a vpn?
2 [2017-03-13T16:37:19] <killerspaz> You'll need to expose any ports necessary to connect to the VPN to the host, then yes you will be essentially jailed inside the container.
3 [2017-03-13T16:37:37] <joeyciechanowicz> fantastic, thanks!
4 [2017-03-13T16:38:00] <killerspaz> otherwise if you choose net=host, you'll be essentially tunneling TO the host
5 [2017-03-13T16:38:51] <killerspaz> we use hamachi atm, and net=host to gain access to remote deploys

1 [2017-03-13T19:45:36] <JnMik> Hello peps! We had a weird issue with Docker swarm this afternoon.We deploy containers using the stack yml file, and we currently don't specify networks in yml, so by having it empty, swarm creates one with a name like stack_name_default and use it.Today, we ended up with a container having it's IP address assigned in the same subnetwork as the docker nodes, and the container lost all connectivity with external services. From inside the container, I was able to ping the other replicas, but wasn't able to curl google.ca or other external services. I tried dropping the service & stack and relaunch it but seems swarm was already redeploying it with the same non-working subnetwork.So I dropped the stack, create an overlay network that I forced to another IP subnetwork, and then re-launched the stack using that pre-created network.It's working for now.Anyone had this issue before, is that a known behavior ? Should we always create network overlay at first, for production servers ?
2 [2017-03-13T20:06:45] <JnMik> Yes they are in the same subnet
3 [2017-03-13T20:06:53] <JnMik> SISheogorath:
4 [2017-03-13T20:08:13] <SISheogorath> mhm because in general docker does a lookup to the hosts routing table. (iirc) You should definitely open an issue for this on github
5 [2017-03-13T20:11:08] <JnMik> Ok I'll do that. Are you aware if there is a daemon parameter to specify a custom subnet for the overlay networks creation ?
6 [2017-03-13T20:12:48] <JnMik> Should I create the issue on docker/libnetwork ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-13T20:00:08] <SISheogorath> Are your servers all in the same subnet or on different subnets than the swarm managers?
2 [2017-03-13T20:00:55] <SISheogorath> JnMik: ^

1 [2017-03-15T07:39:52] <vkrot> Hello guys,I wanted to ask - is it okay for docker swarm to restart ALL containers in a cluster after leader reelection? I had a leader dropped by network split, and after reelection (which took 20min!) all running containers get restarted. Is it an expected behaviour?
2 [2017-03-15T15:11:14] <vkrot> foreversunyao_twitter: , I have logs for journalctl. They tried to elect a new leader for long time, reported network disconnectivity all the time. And all containers got restarted, on both sides on split, but only after new leader was elected. I saw something similar before also, but didn't dig into details that time
3 [2017-03-15T21:04:37] <vkrot> SISheogorath: 4 managers. You know, I've just figured I was wrong - only containers on one side of network split were restarted, the side that was left without leader. Sorry for disinformation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T09:19:20] <foreversunyao_twitter> vkrot: 20 mins is not a normal phenomenon，container restarted may be caused by this abnormal, any error log or other information ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T10:27:13] <SISheogorath> vkrot: on what side of the netsplit the containers got restarted?
2 [2017-03-15T10:30:29] <SISheogorath> tudvari-nng: simply encrypt the directory before you share it with your container. Like you would do without docker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T18:08:31] <wcgcoder> mtcaddy: For both JIRA and Confluence, you'll need to set the tomcat connector in ${INSTALL_DIR}/conf/server.xml to have the right proxy name, port, scheme and set secure to true. There are many Atlassian resources with details on this like [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-03-15T18:24:12] <mcarpenterjr> Hey, anyone happen to have a link to a good resource, or know how to make data persistent for a mysql container? I would like to setup an environment where i could fire up a mysql instance and have it load some "development" tables and data. Load might not be the right word in this instance. As of right now I\'m creating a mysql container and then creating some tables and importing data to them. What I envisioned however was being able to create the mysql container and a have a data structure created when the container was created or have the container load an external data structure. I can\'t seem to figureout how to do either.

1 [2017-03-15T20:07:43] <MariusDiacu_twitter> Hi. Can anyone suggest me a light solution for a local docker environment? I have a coupe of containers managed by docker-compose.

Any idea?

6 [2017-03-15T20:36:14] <SISheogorath> Nice gitter... Kill my markdown
7 [2017-03-15T20:40:19] <SISheogorath> mcarpenterjr: best way to handle SQL data in docker (as far as my experience is) setup the schema on startup of your application. Also make the application aware of the fact that sometimes a database server disappears (for what ever reason) without crashing. In general docker is very good in preventing your setup to die. But sometimes it happens that the restart of a database container takes a little moment and in this case your application should not die. Instead send a useful error and try again.
8 [2017-03-15T20:42:12] <SISheogorath> In general to persist databases use simple volumes (local volumes of you need performance). A detailed guide about where to point that volumes you can find in the README of the official MySQL and mariadb
9 [2017-03-15T20:43:17] <SISheogorath> vkrot: how many managers do you have?
10 [2017-03-15T21:06:32] <SISheogorath> In General it's a bad idea to use a  even number of managers. Because raft won't find the bigger part of the split
11 [2017-03-15T21:07:41] <SISheogorath> vkrot: see [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-03-15T21:08:20] <SISheogorath> That is what is used between managers so hopefully you understand why an odd number of manager nodes is important
13 [2017-03-15T21:20:21] <SISheogorath> Traefik ist lovely :) hope you have as much fun with it as I have :D

1 [2017-03-15T21:32:04] <JasonShin> hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T21:32:20] <JasonShin> Is it a good idea to use Docker as development environment like Vagrant?
2 [2017-03-15T21:35:08] <SISheogorath> JasonShin: it depends on what you want to write but in general, yes, docker can help here and do pretty awesome things
3 [2017-03-15T21:35:17] <JasonShin>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-03-15T21:35:35] <JasonShin> I've wrote my docker-compose and dockerfile inside .docker folder for development
5 [2017-03-15T21:36:00] <JasonShin> SISheogorath: yeah right
6 [2017-03-15T21:37:15] <JasonShin> I guess in my docker-compose, if I want my development environment to be like Vagrant(ish) I would probably need to give it-itflags so when my contributors dodocker-compose upthey immediately go into the container bash
7 [2017-03-15T21:38:21] <JasonShin> SISheogorath: In docker, when dockerfile fails to build an image, is there a way to provision it again so it attempts to install again from where it failed?
8 [2017-03-15T21:38:46] <SISheogorath> Simply add layers
9 [2017-03-15T21:39:10] <SISheogorath> Docker will check changes and rerun from the layer where things changed
10 [2017-03-15T21:39:20] <SISheogorath> Maybe checkout [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-03-15T21:40:28] <JasonShin> nice
12 [2017-03-15T21:41:33] <JasonShin> that's a pretty useful article, thanks.
13 [2017-03-15T21:43:27] <JasonShin>  [<-LINK->] BTW, I was actually asking what's the best way to provision docker build again from where it failed. For example yournpm install node-gypfailed (lost internet connection), is there a way to reboot the build fromnpm install node-gyp?
14 [2017-03-15T21:45:52] <SISheogorath> If you run it in an own layer docker will simply start from the layer before if you rundocker buildagain
15 [2017-03-15T21:47:04] <JasonShin> hmm right
16 [2017-03-15T21:47:30] <SISheogorath> So you maybe should add a dev version of your dockerfile and a production version of you Dockerfile (production version is what you build using CI dev image is the one you build locally
17 [2017-03-15T21:49:02] <JasonShin> right, thanks
18 [2017-03-15T22:03:58] <JasonShin> are you using Docker Security Scanning atm?
19 [2017-03-15T22:30:27] <JasonShin> johnjackson17: Hmm, not sure exactly how you want it to work but I feel like you can use just one account and separete prod, dev, staging images using tags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T21:49:22] <johnjackson17> Hi Everyone,   I wanted to know if I should have two docker hub accounts one for stage/prod and another account for developers for repos?  thanks!
2 [2017-03-15T21:50:34] <JasonShin> I think you can just manage your dockerfile in your version control system
3 [2017-03-15T21:50:39] <JasonShin> that's what I do at work
4 [2017-03-15T21:50:44] <JasonShin> and my project
5 [2017-03-15T21:53:30] <johnjackson17> JasonShin: the reason I ask this is because we have strict requirements from clients that repos need to be scanned all the time for any security vulnerabilities, and what I was thinking is having two account and have developers push to one account and then moved to another account for stage and production..
6 [2017-03-15T22:13:06] <johnjackson17> JasonShin: We will in few weeks..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-15T23:16:07] <SISheogorath> johnjackson17: why should developers push to any account? Build on docker hub and/or your registries should be build by a CI.
2 [2017-03-16T01:31:33] <SISheogorath> Not really. There are many ways to do security scans. Docker cloud offers one. (Yes a nice way to display) But in general you can for example check [<-LINK->] and run it as part of your CI workflow
3 [2017-03-16T01:34:59] <JasonShin> that's awesome
4 [2017-03-16T01:35:08] <JasonShin> I will store that in my google keep =)
5 [2017-03-16T01:37:31] <JasonShin> I like to have all these security checks, linting, etc in my CI pipeline as many as possible. I know it slows down the builds but it feels so satisfying
6 [2017-03-16T01:37:41] <SISheogorath> If you are a "link hunter" keep an eye on my link collection: [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-03-16T01:39:33] <JasonShin> I likehttps://youtu.be/ArK70YZN3S8?t=27m28s. Thanks.
8 [2017-03-16T01:40:21] <SISheogorath> :D yes, lovely ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T00:09:34] <mcarpenterjr> SISheogorath: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T00:28:00] <sameetn> johnjackson17: are you talking in terms of a promotion pipeline? That is possible, but you can do it withouyt multiple accounts. You can do this byt also having separate repositories in the accounts and then creating the teams for clients to controll access. THat way you can use the approach that@SISheogorathmentioned by using the CI to build your images and also to promote them after they are scanned successfully
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T01:24:33] <JasonShin> SISheogorath: @sameetnHey guys, I am wondering, how does Security Scanning works in CI pipelines? Doesn't it require you to build your images in Docker Cloud?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T01:42:31] <smashingx1> Not sure what this error is about:  Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = 4 desc = context deadline exceeded
2 [2017-03-16T01:43:10] <smashingx1> when I executed sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name helloworld alpine ping docker.com
3 [2017-03-16T01:45:15] <smashingx1> I'm pretty sure, but how can I see for sure?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T01:43:24] <SISheogorath> how many managers does your swarm have?
2 [2017-03-16T01:44:43] <smashingx1> 1
3 [2017-03-16T01:45:27] <SISheogorath> docker node ls
4 [2017-03-16T01:48:16] <smashingx1> SISheogorath:  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-03-16T01:48:34] <smashingx1> I wonder why it says swarm-01 is down
6 [2017-03-16T01:49:03] <smashingx1> does that mean that it's not connected to it?
7 [2017-03-16T01:49:07] <SISheogorath> yes not really good is your firewall on all needed ports open?
8 [2017-03-16T01:50:03] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: well it was connected before
9 [2017-03-16T01:50:16] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: can I just try to connect it again?
10 [2017-03-16T01:50:24] <SISheogorath> allx2: not as far as I know. but it depends on your setup. For sure the limits of your normal systems are the same for containers
11 [2017-03-16T01:50:54] <SISheogorath> vforsythe: yes. did you reboot the server or similar?
12 [2017-03-16T01:51:21] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: yes I did
13 [2017-03-16T01:51:35] <smashingx1> do I have to connect to it every time I reboot the server?
14 [2017-03-16T01:51:40] <smashingx1> or one of the nodes?
15 [2017-03-16T01:51:55] <SISheogorath> vforsythe: in this case simply check the firewall. I guess it came up when you restarted the node which prevents it from rejoin the swarm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T01:49:26] <allx2> Hi guys , is there a maximum number of containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T01:56:50] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: I tried to join the node to the swarm again and I get this error: Error response from daemon: This node is already part of a swarm. Use "docker swarm leave" to leave this swarm and join another one.
2 [2017-03-16T01:57:01] <SISheogorath> yes, that's normal
3 [2017-03-16T01:57:10] <SISheogorath> as mentioned did you check the firewall?
4 [2017-03-16T01:58:09] <smashingx1> I flushed all the rules in iptables
5 [2017-03-16T01:58:14] <SISheogorath> See: [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-03-16T01:58:16] <smashingx1> but how can I retry to connect it?
7 [2017-03-16T01:58:38] <SISheogorath> docker swarm reconnects itself as soon as it is possible
8 [2017-03-16T01:58:46] <SISheogorath> make also sure those ports are open on the manager
9 [2017-03-16T02:00:55] <smashingx1> ok
10 [2017-03-16T02:01:00] <smashingx1> I will try with nmap
11 [2017-03-16T02:20:12] <smashingx1> ok the manager is having some networking problems
12 [2017-03-16T02:20:38] <smashingx1> I'm thinking I will make the node that is working a manager and join another server
13 [2017-03-16T02:20:59] <smashingx1> do I have to leave the swarm to promote that server a manager?
14 [2017-03-16T02:35:58] <smashingx1> ok now they are connected
15 [2017-03-16T02:36:12] <smashingx1> the problem was indeed the network
16 [2017-03-16T02:37:14] <smashingx1> but the cryptic error keeps showing up
17 [2017-03-16T02:37:26] <smashingx1> Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = 4 desc = context deadline exceeded
18 [2017-03-16T02:57:14] <smashingx1> for some reason that error is gone
19 [2017-03-16T02:57:17] <smashingx1> thanks for the help
20 [2017-03-16T03:01:12] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T02:10:22] <SISheogorath> are the ports open? if so and the docker node is still not up again restart the docker daemon on that node. If that really doesn't help. Usedocker swarm leaveand join again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T02:53:03] <SISheogorath> what version of docker are you running?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T04:29:18] <khanhnguyenneka> Hi guys, I want to run two project with gunicorn in Docker
2 [2017-03-16T04:29:37] <khanhnguyenneka> ENTRYPOINT ["_env/bin/gunicorn"]\nRUN _env/bin/gunicorn car_element.app -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --reload --log-file=- &\nCMD ["intent_classifier.app", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--reload"]
3 [2017-03-16T04:29:54] <khanhnguyenneka> this is my command in Dockerfile
4 [2017-03-16T04:30:12] <khanhnguyenneka> but  it's run only the last command with gunicorn
5 [2017-03-16T04:30:43] <khanhnguyenneka> How do I need to do something to run multiple project with gunicorn in Docker ? Many thanks all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T04:29:41] <FrankYu> Hi, is there is kubernetes rooms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T04:35:09] <JasonShin> khanhnguyenneka: can you format it little bit better?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T04:39:51] <JasonShin> I have a question about dockerfile's caching feature.According to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soh2k8lCXCAIf there's a dockerfile like [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Would docker curl version 7 and run apt-get install -y nodejs again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T09:04:48] <vvsh_twitter> Hi, I posted an issue on github, but did not receive answer: [<-ISSUE->] , could you please help? Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T09:37:08] <argeas> hi All , anyone know why typing in the terminal ( after ive connected to the docker vm (ubuntu) ) is super laggy ?
2 [2017-03-16T09:37:22] <argeas> e.g . wana stop a container and it just hangs..
3 [2017-03-16T09:37:32] <argeas> have to ctrl c
4 [2017-03-16T09:38:06] <argeas> was using boot2docker... in the begining was ok .. swaped to ubuntu .. initially ok .. then started lagging also..
5 [2017-03-16T09:38:25] <argeas> will buy you ice creams? :)
6 [2017-03-16T12:52:49] <argeas> when i say laggin I mean that even typing in the terminal after connected via ssh
7 [2017-03-16T12:53:09] <argeas> e.g. docker stop command hangs..
8 [2017-03-16T12:53:12] <argeas> etc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T13:33:20] <SISheogorath> FrankYu: check the k8s slack channel linked in their webpage
2 [2017-03-16T13:36:20] <SISheogorath> JasonShin: yes. Caching always go from top to down. Everything below the last  that did not changed anything will run again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T14:15:27] <sbbowers__twitter> Is it possible to convert a docker container into a standalone binary? so something likedocker load <myimage.tgz>; docker run <myimage> <options>could be wound up into a distributable binary run-able likemybinary <options>
2 [2017-03-16T15:58:55] <sbbowers__twitter> shreram: Normally you don't want to install mysql in the container because 1) it won't persist between multiple image runs and 2) databases can have horrible performance if their files are inside the container.
3 [2017-03-16T16:00:27] <sbbowers__twitter> shreram: If this is just a local/development docker use, I normally just expose my local mysql database socket file by mounting it to the container directly.
4 [2017-03-16T16:02:57] <sbbowers__twitter> something likedocker run -v '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'works for me (on ubuntu 16.10)
5 [2017-03-16T16:06:51] <sbbowers__twitter> If you just want a mysql docker instance that your other service can link to, you can use this as a reference: [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-03-16T18:24:22] <sbbowers__twitter> ok. well you can use that link I gave you and then mount a volume into the container where you want the database files to be stored on the host system.
7 [2017-03-16T18:28:21] <shreram> \'\'\'pi@rpi3:~ $ docker run -v \'/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\'"docker run" requires at least 1 argument(s).See \'docker run --help\'.Usage:  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]\'\'\'
8 [2017-03-16T18:32:25] <shreram> I will check other documentation link for docker run command usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T15:28:42] <shreram> Hi, newb here. Recently I installed Docker on Raspberry Pi using [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-03-16T15:29:10] <shreram> I would like to install MySQL database in that Docker container. How do I that?
3 [2017-03-16T18:22:29] <shreram> sbbowers__twitter: Thank you. I installed Docker on Pi but wanted to use MySQL database on Docker instead of built-in SQLite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T15:29:04] <zhouteng> Hi, a question for the "users" in portainer.io web interface, so how can I set up the users so that certain users can not see the containers they are allowed to see? It seems there is nothing you can set up for users there except that I can add users and change their passwords, thanks!
2 [2017-03-16T15:30:36] <zhouteng> sorry, I posted the wrong place, I thought it's portainer.io....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T18:04:52] <toftware> So i've heard that Windows containers does not support service discovery in Swarm, can any of you confirm that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T19:44:33] <fholm> Hey! I'm super new to docker, and just looking for some advice if it's even applicable to my problem domain. Basically I am working on a large game server for a persistent world, where I wil have maybe 3-4 fairly big machines doing the world simulation in together using Project Orleans (microsoft virtual actors thingy)
2 [2017-03-16T19:44:52] <fholm> And all the documentation and videos I\'ve found on docker seem to talk about having small "micro services" and things like that.
3 [2017-03-16T19:46:15] <fholm> Would I benefit from using docker to deploy something like that?
4 [2017-03-16T19:50:35] <fholm> mattoni: thanks :) I'm not even sure I will end up using docker, but felt I needed to ask a few questions, a lot of the benefits seem to do with isolation of processes and lower overhead per applicaiton, etc.
5 [2017-03-16T19:50:58] <fholm> and most of those are non issues to me, because it is just one massive application sharded over several machines using orleans
6 [2017-03-16T19:51:18] <mattoni> Yeah, I'm obviously a bit biased since we're building a whole company around the concept, but I firmly believe any application can benefit from containerization
7 [2017-03-16T19:52:24] <fholm> Yeah for sure, I pretty much assumed people in here would be slightly biased :P
8 [2017-03-16T19:55:14] <SISheogorath> toftware: not sure about discovery but as the whole networking thing is more or less missing yes, sounds reasonable
9 [2017-03-16T19:56:01] <toftware> Yes that's my understanding at well
10 [2017-03-16T19:57:39] <SISheogorath> sbbowers__twitter: it depends a bit on how much load you create with your database containers. They can run without problem if you set them up correctly. Like using something like lvm-direct as volume driver and place it on SSDs. Works wonderful over here :)
11 [2017-03-16T19:59:38] <SISheogorath> shreram: not sure if the official mysql image runs on raspberry pi because raspberry is running arm. Maybe check for an arm image like the hyperiot guys provide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T19:47:21] <mattoni> fholm: at the end of the day, a container is just an isolated process.  If you are able to split up your application so that you have a stateless system to build the world from a central database or something, you could benefit greatly being able to scale without a second thought
2 [2017-03-16T19:47:59] <mattoni> not sure on your exact requirements
3 [2017-03-16T19:48:00] <fholm> mattoni: thanks, exactly the answer i was looking for pretty much, so (my understanding is somewhat correct of docker)
4 [2017-03-16T19:48:09] <fholm> mattoni: currently I am not either :)
5 [2017-03-16T19:48:15] <mattoni> lol
6 [2017-03-16T19:49:07] <mattoni> just a bit of a disclaimer, I'm the CTO of a company doing super simple docker container deployment (think digital ocean for containers) [<-LINK->] . If you need any advice or assistance send me a DM and I'd be happy to help when I get some time :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T21:22:00] <rasouza> Hey a newbie question: does make sense to use docker on a single VPS to create more containers and host your apps? Isn't docker made for physical servers (with high amount of resources) so you have enough resources (CPU and RAM) to share between containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T22:19:17] <SISheogorath> I use docker to increase the security and application isolation on my VPS so yes, it makes sense to use it there :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-16T22:40:08] <CarlosAmaral> hey got a question, im using Dokku and when deploying, I need to run a script that takes 3 inputs, how the syntax should be for the inputs? anyone got a clue?
2 [2017-03-16T22:41:04] <CarlosAmaral> as in “predeploy”: “node whatever.js user=kewl pass=lol"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T00:09:53] <JasonShin> hi docker people
2 [2017-03-17T00:09:54] <JasonShin> =)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T00:11:36] <aios> JasonShin: hi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T00:39:34] <JasonShin> hey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T05:58:48] <lox> I'm trying to figure out an issue with docker 1.13.1 in our CI service. I'm periodically seeingIntermittent ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?after about 10-20 minutes of use. The logs I am seeing for this issue are at [<-LINK->] .
2 [2017-03-17T05:58:52] <lox> Anyone seen anything similar?
3 [2017-03-17T05:59:21] <wcgcoder> JasonShin: hey
4 [2017-03-17T06:00:25] <wcgcoder> lox: I haven't quite seen that error, but I've seen issues recreating a container where it says another.jsonfile can't be opened.
5 [2017-03-17T06:00:42] <lox> Yup seems like it's exactly the same as this: [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-03-17T06:00:52] <lox> e.gstate.json: no such file or directoryand a hard hang.
7 [2017-03-17T06:01:20] <wcgcoder> Mine is something about atmp.____.jsonfile
8 [2017-03-17T06:02:24] <wcgcoder> Wow, is it really 17:00 in Melbourne? I'm still working in CA, US
9 [2017-03-17T06:03:18] <lox> 5pm, yup :)
10 [2017-03-17T06:03:35] <wcgcoder> It's 23h here
11 [2017-03-17T06:03:36] <lox> Ah-hah! [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-03-17T06:04:17] <mattoni> haha, 11pm checkin in from Reno
13 [2017-03-17T06:04:39] <wcgcoder> Interesting that that bug has a host of RHEL 7 with non-loopback devicemapper
14 [2017-03-17T06:05:12] <wcgcoder> I hope I don't come across that problem; yet, I'm still having intermittent with the root device being busy on a similarly configured host
15 [2017-03-17T06:05:21] <wcgcoder> mattoni: Nice.
16 [2017-03-17T06:05:43] <wcgcoder> Anyone going to Dockercon?
17 [2017-03-17T06:05:47] <mattoni> yep!
18 [2017-03-17T06:06:00] <mattoni> bringing my dev team :)
19 [2017-03-17T06:06:50] <wcgcoder> mattoni: Awesome! I'd like to meet up with other devs in the thick of production and see what they're doing
20 [2017-03-17T06:07:14] <mattoni> Definitely! I love Austin, I have fam there so I'm super pumped for it this year
21 [2017-03-17T06:07:21] <wcgcoder> I'm nearly single handedly trying to guide development and ops. Hashtag devops /s
22 [2017-03-17T06:07:25] <mattoni> lol
23 [2017-03-17T06:07:38] <mattoni> well, we've launched our platform recently
24 [2017-03-17T06:07:42] <mattoni>  [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-03-17T06:07:47] <mattoni> check it out some time :)
26 [2017-03-17T06:07:53] <mattoni> but we'll definitely be there.
27 [2017-03-17T06:08:54] <wcgcoder> Nice, some fontawesome in there
28 [2017-03-17T06:09:05] <mattoni> yeah, actually working on redoing the site right now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T09:02:34] <DJQTDJ> is there anyone who knews html5I need some help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T09:39:12] <vvsh_twitter> mattoni: , I have a question regarding cycle.io, do you have an internal docker registry where I can upload my images from my local machine or I have to create private one on hub.docker.com and upload there?
2 [2017-03-17T17:45:14] <vvsh_twitter> mattoni: , thank you very much, I am going to try to run one of my projects on Cycle, but I have to wait until registry is available as I have my images only locally.
3 [2017-03-17T22:42:09] <vvsh_twitter> mattoni: , do you mean as a container?
4 [2017-03-17T22:49:35] <vvsh_twitter> mattoni: , second option is quite expensive, as most of my projects are just for study, but they have up to 7 different images..
5 [2017-03-17T22:50:16] <mattoni> ah yeah, i understand. I haven’t done it personally, but I believe one of my devs is running a copy of docker registry on Cycle.
6 [2017-03-17T22:50:25] <mattoni> might be worth investigating :)
7 [2017-03-17T22:52:48] <vvsh_twitter> I run such on my notebook, so I think it should work. Thanks! What will be the price of your registry?
8 [2017-03-17T22:56:51] <mattoni> I believe when we implement it, it will be a tier feature.
9 [2017-03-17T22:57:01] <mattoni> so our billing is very simple
10 [2017-03-17T22:57:26] <mattoni> you have a tier for your account, which is what features/resources etc you want for your account
11 [2017-03-17T22:57:31] <mattoni> then you pay per container instance you deploy.
12 [2017-03-17T22:57:34] <mattoni> first tier is free
13 [2017-03-17T22:57:37] <mattoni> :)
14 [2017-03-17T22:57:45] <mattoni> not sure where we’ll land with the registry yet
15 [2017-03-17T23:00:04] <mattoni> another option
16 [2017-03-17T23:00:08] <mattoni> is that we support git integration
17 [2017-03-17T23:00:23] <mattoni> so if you have a docker file in your git repo (wherever it is located)
18 [2017-03-17T23:00:26] <mattoni> we’ll build the image for you

1 [2017-03-17T12:14:52] <Pritz_P_twitter> Hi guys, im having a problem successfully being able to curl from the docker container to itself.i have node express application within a container running on port 8080. I have used EXPOSE 80:8080 to allow me to send requests from my browser/postman/etc to node application. My application is posting to itself (within container) but i get connection refused…ive tried http://127.0.0.1/endpoint, http://127.0.0.1:8080/endpoint no avail.Doing docker inspect <containerId> | grep IPAddress = 172.18.0.2 so I tried http://172.18.0.2/endpoint, http://172.18.0.2:8080/endpoint also no avail.Anyone have any ideas?
2 [2017-03-17T13:22:21] <Pritz_P_twitter> danielitit: thanks for the reply - not sure how i resolved it - but i created a network. docker network create <mynetworkname>, docker network connect <mynetworkname> <containerID>
3 [2017-03-17T13:23:58] <Pritz_P_twitter> After inspecting container id, i noticed it created bunch of stuff including gateway ip. That seem to let me post to the gateway 172.0.0.1:8080/endpoint.
4 [2017-03-17T13:25:04] <Pritz_P_twitter> This was after lots of googling… Not great as i dont understand what docker network does.. more reading required…
5 [2017-03-17T13:25:58] <Pritz_P_twitter> appreciate the reply@danielitit
6 [2017-03-17T13:26:41] <danielitit> nice! congrats

1 [2017-03-17T12:34:37] <matrixbot> Rahulkrishnan(rark)Hi all, is there any way to  autoscale the container based on cpu usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T13:04:57] <danielitit> Pritz_P_twitter: Have you tried telnet 172.18.0.2 8080 ? Are you sure that appropriate service is running and listening on port 8080 in container?
2 [2017-03-17T13:06:28] <danielitit> Pritz_P_twitter: Maybe make dock exec -i -t $container bash
3 [2017-03-17T13:06:36] <danielitit> and type ss -lnt or netstat
4 [2017-03-17T13:06:45] <danielitit> and check if something is listening
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T13:11:50] <vvsh_twitter> mattoni: , also I see that you store raw images, not compreseed. e.g. [<-LINK->] weighs only 80 mb, but built image that I see on portal.cycle.io, is about 360 mb. Are you planning to store compressed images, if it is technically possible? Otherwise it might not be enough space you provide if for Tricycle account (e.g. on my notebook images for 3 projects weighs around 25 GB or even more).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T17:22:53] <mattoni> vvsh_twitter: We’re waiting on the OCI Image spec to be finalized before releasing our registry. We want to be able to support all image types. As for compression, I’m going to be releasing an update this weekend that should significantly improve the size of stored images :) hope that helps! DM me if you have any more questions

2 [2017-03-17T17:55:39] <dev-gbassanini> I was hoping you guys could help me with an issue I'm having with a docker file
3 [2017-03-17T17:56:20] <dev-gbassanini> I get a file not found error
4 [2017-03-17T17:56:26] <dev-gbassanini> when building
5 [2017-03-17T17:56:31] <dev-gbassanini> the dockerfile
6 [2017-03-17T17:56:35] <dev-gbassanini> FROM eclipse/ubuntu_jdk8RUN sudo apt-get updateRUN sudo apt-get install nanoADD sqla1201_client_linux_x86x64.tar.gz /tmp/RUN cd /tmp/./client1201/RUN ./setup
7 [2017-03-17T17:58:29] <dev-gbassanini> I'm trying to install the tar.gz file (odbc driver) when building the image
8 [2017-03-17T17:59:49] <dev-gbassanini> I know docker creates an intermediate container everytime it successfully executes a RUN command
9 [2017-03-17T18:00:41] <dev-gbassanini> but I'm not sure how to make this work
10 [2017-03-17T19:24:26] <dev-gbassanini> txs
11 [2017-03-17T19:24:30] <dev-gbassanini> I'll give it a try
12 [2017-03-17T19:24:57] <dev-gbassanini> this is the exact error msg I got

14 [2017-03-17T19:29:45] <dev-gbassanini> Great!
15 [2017-03-17T19:29:48] <dev-gbassanini> it worked
16 [2017-03-17T19:29:51] <dev-gbassanini> thanks
17 [2017-03-17T19:29:56] <dev-gbassanini> for your help
18 [2017-03-17T19:30:18] <dev-gbassanini> now I'm having an issue. It seems the setup requires some user input
19 [2017-03-17T19:30:49] <dev-gbassanini> how can I manage to setup the configuration during the build?
20 [2017-03-17T19:31:04] <dev-gbassanini> or maybe I'll just have to start the container in bash
21 [2017-03-17T19:31:23] <dev-gbassanini> and from that point install the required driver manually?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T18:54:58] <mwspitzer> Not sure what your exact error is. I'm assuming the tar.gz is in the Dockerfile directory. More than likely it's not finding setup. Instead of 'RUN cd /tmp/./client1201', try 'WORKDIR /tmp/client1201'.

Basically for networking getting the error about not able to write over/etc/resolve.conf. I have a temp workaround for that, but when rancheros comes up it's starting all the containers, even though they're marked as create only. Stumped like woah.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T22:37:51] <mattoni> vvsh_twitter: just an FYI, you can host on a private docker registry and Cycle will be able to connect to it
2 [2017-03-17T22:42:36] <mattoni> well, if you’re hosting your own docker registry (could be hosted as a container) or if you’re using a private repo on docker hub, we have support for that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-17T23:09:55] <vvsh_twitter> I have quite complex deployment:1) some images are built using maven, gradle and npm2) then I have docker-compose.yaml which builds some other complex images (where FROM is public one or image from step) and those final images are deployed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-20T09:30:55] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: if you want to debug and the container keeps dieing usedocker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash <image is>
2 [2017-03-20T13:44:00] <SISheogorath> richard-ball: I wouldn't use 2 server (it's possible but a bad idea) 3 servers are the ideal minimum but from 3 to 1000 it's no problem. Reason why 3 and not 2 is raft

2 [2017-03-22T17:45:41] <killerspaz> chrischambers: you need to serve it. Can be a simple node http server, or use nginx to serve. I choose the node http server and use an nginx reverse proxy for all my containers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-22T22:16:37] <SISheogorath> parth22594: it's currently not possible. It also doesn't make a lot of sense as you have to bind ports to sockets. IP based sockets. So use the IPs. If you need to use hostname first resolve them to IP-Addresses
2 [2017-03-22T22:17:57] <SISheogorath> chrischambers: serve you webapp by an nginx container or use express to host ist and put a reverse proxy in front of it.
3 [2017-03-23T09:09:30] <SISheogorath> I really suggest you not to do it, but it's your choice and possibly okay as long as you do it with a really special reason in mind.
4 [2017-03-23T09:12:00] <SISheogorath> ndaidong: that's normal. Fedora uses iirc the build for atomic which has own repositories. So it has to show you which repos you downloaded the images from. Docker.io is the docker hub registry
5 [2017-03-23T09:24:01] <SISheogorath> Not sure about that. As far as I can say and I use fedora myself I never had a problem with autocomplete .-.
6 [2017-03-23T09:25:56] <SISheogorath> But that's possibly based on the fact that I use zsh and the oh my zsh  docker extension

1 [2017-03-23T07:41:39] <ndaidong> hi everyone, how I can hide the first part "docker.io/" in images\' name while listing images with "docker image"
2 [2017-03-23T07:42:57] <ndaidong>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-03-23T07:44:19] <ndaidong> I'm using fedora 25
4 [2017-03-23T07:45:06] <ndaidong> in the ubuntu based machines, it just displays repository name without "docker.io/" at first
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T07:48:31] <papaiatis> hi guys! is it possible to build a new image from a running docker container? so I mean with "docker run" I start a new container, perform the necessary steps by hand (install packages, config stuff, etc), then without creating a Dockerfile that does the same thing, just build an image from this running container?
2 [2017-03-23T07:51:22] <ndaidong> I think that you can tag it to another image
3 [2017-03-23T07:52:13] <ndaidong> ah, no, forget it, container is container
4 [2017-03-23T08:00:49] <papaiatis> I think "docker commit" is what I want
5 [2017-03-23T08:02:09] <ndaidong> yes, thanks, a new thing for me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T08:02:07] <sopanshewale> yes.@papaiatis, you should be using docker commit
2 [2017-03-23T08:03:14] <sopanshewale> Example is:docker commit -m"updated perl modules" 2327e636355c sopanshewale/gdrive_php
3 [2017-03-23T08:03:49] <sopanshewale> here - "2327e636355c" is actually your running docker container instance\'s id
4 [2017-03-23T08:04:09] <sopanshewale> "sopanshewale/gdrive_php is my container tag/name .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T09:16:19] <ndaidong> thanks@SISheogorath,  can I hide it from screen for shorter and easier reference?
2 [2017-03-23T09:17:27] <ndaidong> now when I want to use "mongo" image, I have to type " [<-LINK->] " instead of just "mongo"
3 [2017-03-23T09:17:59] <ndaidong> the terminal's autocomplete feature does not work as normal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T09:27:37] <papaiatis> can someone tell me how to expose the http port 80 from a container to the outside world when docker host is in virtualbox?
2 [2017-03-23T09:32:02] <papaiatis> with docker -p 80:80 I can expose the http port from container to host. But the port 80 on host still mapped to localhost, which is the virtualbox machine.
3 [2017-03-23T09:35:47] <papaiatis> okay, this is the solution: "docker -p <VBOXIP>:80:80 ...", where VBOXIP is the IP address of the vbox machine
4 [2017-03-23T09:36:11] <papaiatis> sadly, VBOXIP cannot be an FQDN...
5 [2017-03-23T10:41:09] <papaiatis> what does this expression mean? [::]:80
6 [2017-03-23T10:41:48] <papaiatis> is that the IPv6 version of a bound address?
7 [2017-03-23T11:42:29] <papaiatis> MonXBZH: I found that in an nginx config, and that's indeed means IPv6 binding
8 [2017-03-23T11:43:11] <papaiatis> another question: the "EXPOSE" command in a Dockerfile, what does it do exactly? If I have "EXPOSE 5000" is that mean I can get rid of the "-p 0.0.0.0:5000:5000" argument? Because it doesn\'t seem so
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T09:30:29] <SISheogorath> papaiatis: how would you do it without docker? If you found this way you can do it with docker, too. I guess there are a bunch of examples on StackOverflow
2 [2017-03-23T09:55:12] <sopanshewale> papaiatis: - you can add entry in your /etc/hosts file
3 [2017-03-23T09:55:19] <sopanshewale> it can FQDN then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T10:36:51] <ndaidong> thanks,@SISheogorathfor replying my question
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T10:42:03] <MonXBZH> There is a thing, which still listenning on the port 80 .. ?
2 [2017-03-23T10:42:47] <MonXBZH> Can you print here, ur prompt when you seen this pls ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T12:47:05] <MonXBZH> papaiatis: EXPOSE seems to be an specialy Dockerfile command. She is used to EXPOSE a port for link containers together. Not sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-23T14:29:41] <killerspaz> elcolie: why can't you read it?
2 [2017-03-23T14:30:18] <killerspaz> papaiatis: no, it merely expresses intent to expose a port, it does nothing more.
3 [2017-03-23T14:30:43] <killerspaz> if only sharing ONE port, you are able to simply do-p localPortand leave off the container port map
4 [2017-03-23T14:30:50] <killerspaz> but that is ill-advised

1 [2017-03-24T09:56:50] <pro100filipp> Hello! I have a question about how to collect test results from image. I'm using Visual Studio Team Services for CI and my build process is so: push the code -> build test image -> collect test data -> build prod image -> push prod image to registry. When all tests have passed it's OK, but how can I obtain test data from docker image and at the same time stop further building when there are failed tests?
2 [2017-03-24T12:00:29] <pro100filipp> SISheogorath: ok, I thought the same, but wanted to keep production image cleaner. However I will reconsider this) nonetheless the problem remains as I want to collect test results (e. g. XUnit.xml) from the image with failed tests. If I run tests with "RUN", an image won\'t be built. And if I run with "CMD" it will be in production with failed tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-24T11:14:43] <SISheogorath> In general I wouldn't suggest you to run you test against another image than you want to use in production. (In speech of integration tests) unit tests etc can be built in a own test environment image if you need additional frameworks, packages and libraries for that. But the idea of container is to use the same image on as many platforms as possible so it's better to test your production image instead of testing a test image and build the production image after it.

1 [2017-03-24T13:53:33] <earthquakesan> Hi everyone! Is there a doc with all event types somewhere?
2 [2017-03-24T13:53:52] <earthquakesan> Or there it is not achievable, because each event type is generated by different components
3 [2017-03-24T13:54:25] <earthquakesan> Can someone please point me to a code snippet for event emitting please?

1 [2017-03-24T13:58:23] <papaiatis> hi guys! how can I set a default value to a an Environment variable in Dockerfile? so lets say if BUILD_TARGET is not set, give it a default value of "development"
2 [2017-03-24T14:00:41] <papaiatis> so lets say I have this in Dockerfile: "ENV BUILD_TARGET development". What if I execute this: "docker run --env BUILD_TARGET=production ..." ? Will the BUILD_TARGET overwritten with the ENV command?
3 [2017-03-24T14:01:00] <earthquakesan> yes
4 [2017-03-24T14:01:23] <papaiatis> So that's not helping.
5 [2017-03-24T14:09:08] <papaiatis> also, it seems "docker build" doesn\'t accept the "env" argument

1 [2017-03-24T14:36:59] <jscheel> I have been experiencing a really frustrating issue for the past few months with docker. I have a boot2docker VM on vmware fusion 8, set up through docker-machine. I am on osx 10.11.6, and all of my docker tooling is up to date. When my computer goes to sleep, everything is fine. But, when it transitions from sleep to hibernate, I get a sleep wake failure, and my computer reboots. This happens, without fail, every single time I leave my docker machine running. If I shut it down beforehand, my computer is fine. I initially thought it might be related to this issue here: [<-ISSUE->] , but I’m not running docker for mac. Anyone else experiencing this issue?
2 [2017-03-24T16:41:50] <jscheel> wcgcoder: polling causes super-high cpu usage on mac
3 [2017-03-24T16:41:54] <jscheel> was a non-starter
4 [2017-03-24T16:42:06] <jscheel> technically, I’m using dinghy to run everything
5 [2017-03-24T16:42:15] <jscheel>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-03-24T16:42:23] <wcgcoder> What's using polling? For host mapped volumes?
7 [2017-03-24T16:43:39] <wcgcoder> Working with a mid-2015 MBP model here; gave Docker 4 CPUs and 6 GB. No problems with CPU usage at all (except when running java in a container, and that's just java).
8 [2017-03-24T16:46:37] <jscheel> it’s been a while since I last looked at it, but iirc, the issue was file access in mounted volumes was cpu bound
9 [2017-03-24T16:46:44] <jscheel> made things waaaaay too slow
10 [2017-03-24T16:47:15] <jscheel> this guy, iirc: [<-ISSUE->]
11 [2017-03-24T16:47:51] <wcgcoder> I'm not feeling the pain right now; what's still slow is doing builds with large amounts of code or resources that needs to be copied in.
12 [2017-03-24T16:50:27] <wcgcoder> jscheel: are you mapping in code and other resources from your host for development purposes?
13 [2017-03-24T16:50:47] <jscheel> wcgcoder: yes
14 [2017-03-24T16:56:41] <wcgcoder> It's interesting. On my Mac, I don't have these disk IO problems, but maybe it's because I've provisioned half my CPUs to the VM. But my colleague on the other hand has some pretty awful Docker IO problems. I'll check in on his Docker 4 Mac settings.
15 [2017-03-24T22:00:44] <wcgcoder> chrismpalmer: Kind of crappy for people to be making incorrect claims and put the burden of proof on you for the defense.

1 [2017-03-24T16:40:56] <wcgcoder> jscheel: I reallyreallysuggest you migrate to Docker for Mac

2 [2017-03-25T17:59:50] <JT-Bruch> actually... would /shutdown /t 10 work? (windows docker)
3 [2017-03-25T18:06:05] <dragon788> JT-Bruch: nano-server or server-core?
4 [2017-03-25T18:06:13] <JT-Bruch> server-core
5 [2017-03-25T18:06:39] <dragon788> if you doRestart-Computervia powershell it may work, seeman Restart-Computerfor additional arguments
6 [2017-03-25T18:07:09] <dragon788> nano-server doesn't have some of the non-PowerShell stuff so I stick with the most compatible which is usually using PowerShell
7 [2017-03-25T18:07:46] <JT-Bruch> actually thats exactly what I'm trying
8 [2017-03-25T18:09:08] <JT-Bruch> good timing! :D
9 [2017-03-25T18:09:20] <dragon788> did it work?
10 [2017-03-25T18:10:09] <dragon788> otherwise you might have to do something crazy like mapping in the docker socket/remote api uri and send the command to the container "from the inside"
11 [2017-03-25T18:10:57] <dragon788> MonXBZH: I believe there are a couple approaches to Docker for ARM, but you haven't found that installing from the Docker repository according to the directions works on the Raspberry Pi under Raspbian/etc?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-25T19:53:16] <jeserkin> Guys, is there a way to map exposed volume without loosing it content inside container?
2 [2017-03-25T20:41:59] <jeserkin> I see, that it is possible to add mappings relative to current directory with docker-compose, but I can find how areRUNcommands handled in docker-compose in comparison to Dockerfile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-26T00:38:19] <SISheogorath> There are noRUNcommand in compose. Compose is used to orchestrate local docker containers while the Dockerfile is there to build images
2 [2017-03-26T00:41:49] <SISheogorath> And when you mount a named volume to your directory the structure stays. If you mount a directory from your host it's always empty or contains the things you place into the location on your host. So you maybe run your container one and copy everything out or change the image to bootstrap the filestructure into you volume if it doesn't exist.

1 [2017-03-29T09:37:09] <mreis1> Hello Guys,I’m running an image with a docker volume mapped to a container volume.I would like to be able to export that container and it’s docker volume to a new computer. Is there a way to do that?Here’s my setup [<-CODE->] I did saw container_export but I’m afraid it will not work as expected. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_export/
2 [2017-03-29T11:20:02] <mreis1> @srollinet since you are on windows I would say that your volume mount should look something like this-v c:\\Users\\<user>\\logs\\:/var/log/apache2again, this is just how I imagine the behaviour, I didn’t test it at all

1 [2017-03-29T11:10:46] <srollinet> Hi! Using docker for windows, is it possible to access a volume from my windows host if I mount it here:/var/log/apache/:/var/log/apache2/?
2 [2017-03-29T11:30:37] <srollinet> mreis1: My problem is that this is in a docker-compose file that will be used with linux and windows hosts. So I hoped it was possible to have the same mounts.Maybe the easiest solution for me is to have another docker-compose file for windows, and that overrides this config.

1 [2017-03-29T11:32:25] <apt-getyou> use   '~/to/you/path'  ?

4 [2017-03-29T11:39:47] <srollinet> apt-getyou: at least on windows, so I think it will work on linux as well, I will try soon

1 [2017-03-30T10:36:28] <slvrtrn> Hi all, I have a question regarding containers started via Docker in Mac OS X.They become unresponsible after certain amount of time, and that's quite annoying.I have to restart daemon every time.My situation is just like described here: docker/for-mac#1009I tried to increase connections (4000 instead of default 900) for docker as described in djs55's post, but it doesn't seem to work for me.In logs I still see: [<-CODE->] and that's very strange, cause at the same time [<-CODE->] Docker version: 17.03.0-ce-mac2 (15657)Any ideas? I had same troubles on stable version as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-30T15:57:52] <pckeyan> Hi all, Can you help me on how to/where to get the number of connections  and where do I configure the maximum number Connections?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-30T16:18:23] <SISheogorath> What kind of connections?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-03-30T16:45:08] <pckeyan> I have a similar behaviour of container goes unresponsive after a period of time like mentioned by@slvrtrn. Interested to check whether it is an issue in my environment. Can you please help me here?

1 [2017-03-30T20:49:12] <l3x> Hi all, I'm looking for help making a basic tcp connection from a container to a server running on port 1443 on the host (127.0.0.1).EXPOSE (and using the -p command line option) works great for exposing  container ports.I didn't think there would be any problems connecting to a container's host port.  I was wrong.Here's what it looks like: [<-CODE->] Any ideas?
2 [2017-03-30T21:26:50] <l3x> Was thinking it may have something to do with the docker bridge ... So when I rundocker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name ddi-prod --dns 172.17.0.1 debugging-docker-imagesand then open a shell and attempt totelnet 172.17.0.1 1443still no luck.  Any ideas?
3 [2017-03-30T21:59:48] <l3x> Figured it out... The trick was to use my actual host ip address.  localhost/127.0.0.1 in the context of the container is the docker engine, not the host computer (which in my case is a mac).  Cheers!

1 [2017-03-31T14:21:52] <jdaltonchilders> Hey everyone!I'm fairly new to docker so I have a few questions about a project I'm trying to get off the ground. I need to create multiple celery instances, which should be executing a python script. These celery instances will be making api calls to a service, but I'd like for each instances to get its IP from the DHCP servers and not share localhosts IP. I'd still like to have the internal network so the container can communicate, but the api calls need to be coming from separate IPs. I've seen people mention setting a static IP, but I was trying to make it more flexible than that...
2 [2017-03-31T14:24:59] <ChipWolf> take a look at consul
3 [2017-03-31T14:25:20] <ChipWolf> there's probably a native way to do it with Docker thinking about it

3 [2017-04-01T18:41:11] <LouisWayne> DigitalOcean looks good - but I wanna know other good options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-01T20:05:02] <mac2000> Em, why tomcat? I mean if you are going to self managing solutions DO is ok as absolutely any other VM provider, but if you are going for PaaS then it is not your problem, I'am not sure but bet that both beanstalk from aws and web app from azure can host your jar
2 [2017-04-01T20:06:07] <LouisWayne> Just because I like Spring Framework lol
3 [2017-04-02T07:07:34] <mac2000> SQL Server Management Studio is a free one fully featured thing for that but unfortunately its not a web based but still may be a thing to look at

1 [2017-04-02T04:44:38] <chkm8> Hi, i am using ms sql server linux docker container for my other project(requirement is ms sql), do you know any tools that I can use to view the database via admin panel same like phpmyadmin? I found this container [<-LINK->] but I cant make it work or connect to my ms sql container. Im hoping for your inputs.
2 [2017-04-02T07:09:19] <chkm8> Yup but im using linux distro., Though, ive seen tools that could be run via wine, but i my sql server is in a docker container.
3 [2017-04-02T07:12:42] <mac2000> If all you need is simple querying stuff then may be DataGrip from JetBrains may be a choice
4 [2017-04-02T07:14:58] <mac2000> Or even Visual Studio Code with sql extension - [<-LINK->] but in both cases you will need to manually query master database for desired sql server internals (metrics, stats, etc)
5 [2017-04-02T07:41:15] <chkm8> hmmp vs code might be of use, it also has a docker image [<-LINK->] , ill check on this, thanks@mac2000
6 [2017-04-02T09:19:00] <chkm8> mac2000: , the vscode docker container works in my ubuntu 16. I just pulled the image and setup the connection I can now execute queries from vs code and vs code output it. thanks for it. :)
7 [2017-04-02T09:24:47] <mac2000> chkm8: can you please try run something likeselect * from sys.sysprocessesjust wondering will it work on linux box
8 [2017-04-02T09:29:13] <chkm8> sure,@mac2000it has a result but i dont think we can upload image here.
9 [2017-04-02T09:30:03] <mac2000> cool, seems that ms really ported everything
10 [2017-04-02T09:31:32] <chkm8> if thats the case , they did a great work. And also credits to the creator of the image also.

1 [2017-04-02T20:25:25] <georgeedwards> Hi, I am not able to start Docker on Windows because of a memory issue - would really appreciate some help - [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-02T21:03:20] <pecigonzalo> Try directly starting the VM from Hyper-V@georgeedwards
2 [2017-04-02T21:03:31] <pecigonzalo> Just to ensure that works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-02T21:07:22] <chkm8> georgeedwards: , how many GB of memory you have? In windows, it is required to have atleast 4G, but if you run plenty of application it will consumed more of your memory having this error, you can still run docker but make sure to manage your memory consumption well. You can increase your memory.
2 [2017-04-02T21:07:43] <pecigonzalo> He has 4GB from the link
3 [2017-04-02T21:09:15] <chkm8> ahh, 4GB is not enough, i dont know what windows needed that much memory, even if it uses Hyper V. I needed to change my memory to make docker works in windows.
4 [2017-04-02T21:09:48] <pecigonzalo> As far as i recall, you can make it work by manually managing the Hyper-V memory and startup
5 [2017-04-02T21:09:54] <pecigonzalo> it just doesnt work from the "nice gui"
6 [2017-04-02T21:12:47] <chkm8> hmmp., ah I did not changed the memory in hyper v, I was running plenty of application at the same time, I have ms sql server running and multiple browser in chrome, so it would end up eating all the memory, though could be a temporary solution.
7 [2017-04-02T21:23:31] <chkm8> mac2000: , somebody told me from another forum that adminer is an alternative for phpmyadmin, [<-LINK->] and it runs on docker.

1 [2017-04-03T10:26:21] <jeserkin> Good day everyone!
2 [2017-04-03T10:26:49] <jeserkin> Is there a way to order commands in docker-compose? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-03T14:06:19] <georgeedwards> I am using Docker on Windows, and trying to get started with this [<-LINK->] , so I ran the command:docker run --name test-ng -v //C:/Users/George/Source/Repos/existing%20project:/opt alexsuch/angular-cli -p 4200:4200 angular-cli:latesthowever, I get:docker: Error response from daemon: invalid bind mount spec "/C:/Users/George/Source/Repos/existing%20project:/opt": invalid mode: /optI copied that from the docs, what is wrong with the /opt directory and why is it being referred to as a mode?
2 [2017-04-04T10:04:06] <georgeedwards> mac2000: Thanks so much!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-03T14:46:14] <mac2000> @georgeedwards  you do not need double slashes in front of c drive, also really important to wrap path with spaces into double quotes [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-04T13:04:36] <mac2000> georgeedwards: I'm not an angular expert but bet that you will have troubles trying to run something that requires X inside docker, try to swap chrome with phantomjs inside your test runner it should work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-04T13:31:11] <jeserkin> any docker experts? :)
2 [2017-04-04T14:41:16] <jeserkin>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] it runs all tasks as expected at sets up the environment as needed, but it does exit in the end and when I try to start it exists all the time.

5 [2017-04-04T14:48:27] <jeserkin> If it worked with base image, that I am using, then this behaviour should be present there, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-04T14:42:06] <pecigonzalo> Does you image havebash? Whats setup.sh?
2 [2017-04-04T14:42:25] <pecigonzalo> Do you have this in a public repo? I can go give it a look
3 [2017-04-04T14:47:07] <pecigonzalo> Quick overiew, you install and exit so that is what happens
4 [2017-04-04T14:47:40] <pecigonzalo> You need to "run" something
5 [2017-04-04T14:48:05] <pecigonzalo> how do you run your node app?
6 [2017-04-04T14:48:07] <pecigonzalo> normally
7 [2017-04-04T14:48:55] <pecigonzalo> Well you are changing the command you execute / script i assume
8 [2017-04-04T14:49:03] <pecigonzalo> let me check the base image
9 [2017-04-04T14:50:22] <pecigonzalo> the base image runs NGINX
10 [2017-04-04T14:50:37] <pecigonzalo> sorry, apache
11 [2017-04-04T14:52:21] <pecigonzalo> Also, are you trying to build code in the container, or this is the image you are going to run the app on?
12 [2017-04-04T14:52:44] <jeserkin> Yep.
13 [2017-04-04T14:52:54] <pecigonzalo> ?
14 [2017-04-04T14:52:56] <pecigonzalo> run or build?
15 [2017-04-04T14:54:01] <jeserkin> First I build, then I map, then I run
16 [2017-04-04T14:54:06] <pecigonzalo> Ok
17 [2017-04-04T14:54:43] <jeserkin> At least that is the plan
18 [2017-04-04T14:54:50] <jeserkin> But not working so far.
19 [2017-04-04T14:54:54] <pecigonzalo> ok 1 moment
20 [2017-04-04T14:54:57] <jeserkin> Sure
21 [2017-04-04T14:57:17] <pecigonzalo> your Dockerfile should be something like [<-CODE->]
22 [2017-04-04T14:57:24] <pecigonzalo> that adds the setup, and setups everything on BUILD
23 [2017-04-04T14:58:24] <jeserkin> I think I tried this way and whendocker-composeadded mapping with host system, then contents of mapped volumes went down the drain
24 [2017-04-04T14:58:49] <jeserkin> That is why I calledsetup.shas last strep
25 [2017-04-04T14:58:59] <jeserkin> after build and mapping
26 [2017-04-04T14:59:12] <pecigonzalo> yeah but then your build is local to your pc
27 [2017-04-04T14:59:19] <pecigonzalo> does not stay in the container
28 [2017-04-04T14:59:28] <pecigonzalo> so if you send me the container, i need to run setup again
29 [2017-04-04T15:01:15] <pecigonzalo> If you build inside the container, you shouldnt need to mount the volume
30 [2017-04-04T15:01:26] <jeserkin> that was the plan
31 [2017-04-04T15:01:50] <pecigonzalo> docker-compose.yml [<-CODE->]
32 [2017-04-04T15:02:15] <jeserkin> I need to mount it, because I need access to files from host system and not through terminal
33 [2017-04-04T15:02:19] <pecigonzalo> Im trying o read where the apache-php image expects the files
34 [2017-04-04T15:02:38] <pecigonzalo> Ok
35 [2017-04-04T15:02:40] <pecigonzalo> then do this
36 [2017-04-04T15:02:41] <jeserkin> in the app directory
37 [2017-04-04T15:02:44] <pecigonzalo> change your setup.sh
38 [2017-04-04T15:02:49] <pecigonzalo> at the end add the following
39 [2017-04-04T15:04:03] <jeserkin> nothing came through
40 [2017-04-04T15:04:29] <jeserkin> what should be added in the end ofsetup.sh?
41 [2017-04-04T15:07:10] <pecigonzalo> exec /opt/docker/bin/entrypoint.sh supervisord
42 [2017-04-04T15:07:23] <pecigonzalo> that will execute the original process daemon that your base image uses
43 [2017-04-04T15:07:39] <pecigonzalo> but TBH i dont think its aniceway of running your app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-04T15:13:58] <jeserkin> Haven't found better one with automated port and volume mapping and without the loss of mapped volumes content
2 [2017-04-04T16:34:15] <jeserkin> AnthonyWC: not sure I am following. Any examples with provided earlier context?
3 [2017-04-04T21:06:39] <jeserkin> Thanks everyone for help
4 [2017-04-05T11:47:39] <jeserkin> pecigonzalo: btw, it seems, that use ofcommandindocker-composeorCMDinDockerfileautomatically tells, that the terminal where one will run it requires admin. permissions.

3 [2017-04-05T00:16:25] <mbonig> got a question for y'all... I'm looking for a tool that will allow me to manage local docker image and runtime (I'm a developer), same functionality as the cli, just a nicer UI version for that. Is there something already out there?
4 [2017-04-05T05:05:12] <mixpix3ls> mbonig: Perhaps Kitematic is what you’re looking for.

1 [2017-04-06T10:45:33] <mgangelov> Hello, can somebody tell me what are the available statuses for swarm nodes availability, when using the legacy swarm mode (the one with theswarmdocker image)? So far I've only encounteredHealthyandPending, but was wondering if there are more and couldn't find anything in the documentation. Thanks in advance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T17:04:21] <pecigonzalo> FYI: Docker Swarm for AWS based on Terraform (Instead of CloudFormation) and using mostly public code images (Working on a replacement for l4controller) [<-LINK->]

2 [2017-04-06T21:52:51] <AnthonyWC> jeud: sure just change your docker-compose.yml

1 [2017-04-06T18:36:49] <killerspaz> To anyone here that is associated with Docker and DockerCon.. When I pay $1100 per ticket, this shit DOES NOT FUCKING FLY: [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-04-06T18:39:10] <killerspaz> also whoever's in charge of scheduling should be fired.  putting all the advanced topics at the same time has to be the dumbest thing i've heard of at a convention.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T18:39:18] <vito-c> in my parent image I have: ONBUILD RUN echo "FOO" > /bar.txt but when I build the child image there is no bar.txt
2 [2017-04-06T18:40:05] <vito-c> anyone ever have issues withONBUILD RUN?
3 [2017-04-06T23:26:46] <vito-c> killerspaz: yah I can even see the RUN command execute but the file doesn't exist in my child image
4 [2017-04-07T03:42:17] <vito-c> well it is node
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T18:46:05] <killerspaz> @vito-c that's how it works, as per docs:Triggers are cleared from the final image after being executed. In other words they are not inherited by “grand-children” builds.
2 [2017-04-06T18:46:38] <killerspaz> at least that's how i'm reading it... personally never used ONBUILD
3 [2017-04-06T18:46:59] <killerspaz> i just have scripts that my children builds either at build time or on entrypoint
4 [2017-04-06T19:18:57] <killerspaz> looks like i'm wrong anyway:The ONBUILD instruction adds to the image a trigger instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build. The trigger will be executed in the context of the downstream build, as if it had been inserted immediately after the FROM instruction in the downstream Dockerfile.
5 [2017-04-06T19:19:13] <killerspaz> but only for immediate children?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T19:00:09] <vito-c> but i'm just trying to get the child to run and create the file why... why would it clear the file?
2 [2017-04-06T19:00:15] <vito-c> it doesn't make sense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T19:29:26] <jeud> hi, is it possible to restart an existing container with new options ? e.g. new volume mapping
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-06T22:15:46] <realisation> Hey there, I was surprised that an empty node 6.10.2 image is 660 mb large
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-07T15:59:04] <Nilesh20> is anyone have problem statements for docker want to practice on docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-07T17:26:01] <killerspaz> vito-c: and the user at the time theechois exec'd is root? Your root folder/(not user) should be owned by the root user, so if you're switching users that will essentially fail, possibly silently
2 [2017-04-07T17:27:58] <vito-c> killerspaz: Isn't the user in the container during the build process always root?
3 [2017-04-07T17:28:16] <vito-c> killerspaz: for example RUN apt-get .... you don't need to sudo
4 [2017-04-07T17:28:36] <killerspaz> not if you switch users using theUSERinstruction
5 [2017-04-07T17:28:51] <killerspaz> but if you're not doing that (or the parent), then it's a moot point

1 [2017-04-08T11:35:02] <yuvgeek> how to host multiple site in same domain using docker?
2 [2017-04-08T11:35:07] <yuvgeek> apache server
3 [2017-04-08T12:38:52] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: you search for a Reverse-Proxy. Checkout Traefik or nginx as reverse proxy
4 [2017-04-09T00:49:58] <SISheogorath> You can use apache
5 [2017-04-09T00:50:11] <SISheogorath> No need for nginx in this case
6 [2017-04-09T12:29:10] <SISheogorath> XiaozhongLiu: any special reason? Because you should avoid it when ever possible. And you should know that based on the isolated network stack you can't reach those static IPs from outside. If you still want it, checkout the docker-compose file from mailcow-dockerized. But I recommend you not to do it and use DNS names instead
7 [2017-04-11T00:23:30] <SISheogorath> I currently ask myself if it is a docker error or an error of the application you want to run in docker. I guess it's the latter so you should may ask the developer of your application.
8 [2017-04-11T00:27:30] <SISheogorath> And an additional hint@developer-guyas this is not a support hotline and all help is someone else spending his free time for your problem, try to be nice and explain what you did, what you are about to do and what you already did to resolve the problem. Very helpful in general is to read and follow this guide: [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-04-11T12:07:31] <RyoIkarashi> Does anyone have an answer for this? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T16:38:05] <synelang> RyoIkarashi: shared mysql instance but indenpent data for each databse ?  just indenpend mysql instance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T16:39:53] <RyoIkarashi> synelang: Thanks for the reply! I just want to use only one shared mysql instance. Do you know any workaround to accomplish this?
2 [2017-04-11T16:43:42] <synelang> RyoIkarashi: what you want to do is not in Docker way
3 [2017-04-11T16:47:29] <RyoIkarashi> synelang: I'm very new to Docker and I thought it'd be easy to maintenance if other containers share one mysql instance because I don't need to change port number for each mysql instance for example. But could you please explain why it's not in Docker way?
4 [2017-04-11T17:48:35] <RyoIkarashi> dragon788: yes, I totally agree with you. I'm not planning to scale sites and wanna cut the cost as much as I can. So in this context, having one shared DB should be enough.
5 [2017-04-11T17:49:43] <thebuccaneersden> well, my example above worked for me and seems to me what you wanted to achieve...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T17:24:41] <synelang> RyoIkarashi: wordpress container already got the hostname of  mysql container, so no longer need to expose port 3306
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T17:40:53] <dragon788> RyoIkarashi: like mentioned you could use linked containers to link your wordpress containers to the central database, but it would be better to create a single DB per wordpress site to make them more portable and also so you can backup each on their own
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T17:41:23] <thebuccaneersden> RyoIkarashi: This kinda works for me. I threw it together pretty quickly, so I’m sure some of it could be tweaked better
2 [2017-04-11T17:41:33] <thebuccaneersden>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-04-11T17:43:04] <thebuccaneersden> dragon788: I kinda disagree with that (that the docker way is to have separate dbs per wordpress site)
4 [2017-04-11T17:43:40] <thebuccaneersden> it can be, but its really down to how you want your infrastructure to scale
5 [2017-04-11T17:43:54] <thebuccaneersden> and $$$
6 [2017-04-11T17:47:29] <dragon788> thebuccaneersden: I completely agree, he mentioned wanting shared, I'd suggest one per site but that isn't always possible
7 [2017-04-11T17:48:05] <dragon788> if it isn't going into production there are many ways to accomplish it
8 [2017-04-11T17:48:12] <dragon788> if you want to scale, there are definitely best practices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-11T17:52:07] <RyoIkarashi> thebuccaneersden: Thanks for sharing your code! Does that compose file create two DBs, foo and bar right? Is there any way to initialize each WP site with some data by sql?
2 [2017-04-11T17:53:57] <thebuccaneersden> RyoIkarashi: No, the example above creates 3 containers - 1 db container & 2 wordpress containers and the wordpress containers are sharing the db container
3 [2017-04-11T17:55:46] <RyoIkarashi> thebuccaneersden: Ah I mean two DB name, foo and bar in one maria DB?
4 [2017-04-11T17:55:49] <thebuccaneersden> as for your second question, i dont know. lemme check the documentation. if there is a way to run commands when docker-compose goes up, then you could have a script that checks to see if the db for the wordpress instance exists, if not, import sql file
5 [2017-04-11T17:56:23] <thebuccaneersden> yes. two dbs - foo and bar on one db instance - correct
6 [2017-04-11T17:57:22] <RyoIkarashi> thebuccaneersden: Gonna check out the documentation. Thanks anyway! :)
7 [2017-04-11T18:03:10] <thebuccaneersden> RyoIkarashi: I can’t test it for you, but you could possibly usecommand: something.sh?
8 [2017-04-11T18:03:45] <thebuccaneersden> and in something, have the logic that checks if it needs to import the db or not, based on whether the db (ie.foo) exists in the db instance
9 [2017-04-11T18:09:17] <RyoIkarashi> thebuccaneersden: I think your suggestion should meet my requirements. Im gonna give it a try. Thanks!
10 [2017-04-11T18:10:25] <thebuccaneersden> np amigo
11 [2017-04-11T18:11:05] <RyoIkarashi> thebuccaneersden: Appreciate your kindness

1 [2017-04-12T15:07:26] <w0rldart> Hey guys! Quick question... whilst with a Vagrant box I can define and bring all my required services up for a project (i.e.: its APIs, Daemons and so on), what would be the best way of doing so with Docker? I am aware I can use Docker's compose to launch services based on custom images, but not sure how to manage that with compose for a project broken down into a lot of small pieces
2 [2017-04-12T15:40:37] <w0rldart> Say my project is called Invoices, when I power up my development environment on Vagrant,  everything is configured so that all of its dependencies (the small pieces that makes it whole) are ready to work. I.E.: Afront-end,two APIs,a mailing daemonand aqueue worker(say they're all located in/srv/invoices/{www,api-individuals,api-business,mailer,worker}
3 [2017-04-12T15:41:13] <w0rldart> what I am looking for, is the way to convert that to a Docker alternative because the VM is quite heavy on the resources
4 [2017-04-12T15:41:19] <w0rldart> but I guess@dragon788is right
5 [2017-04-12T15:42:18] <w0rldart> have a docker-compose.yml that initiates all those services based on their custom images
6 [2017-04-12T15:42:40] <w0rldart> with a custom network and exposing the appropriate ports
7 [2017-04-12T15:46:16] <w0rldart> I apologise for the not so clear initial question. Rushed into it and I'm quite tired
8 [2017-04-13T09:02:52] <w0rldart> coo! thanks dude
9 [2017-04-13T09:02:55] <w0rldart> cool*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-12T15:21:04] <hatrena> w0rldart: i am not sure if i got your question exactly, but you can config your setting in your docker-compose.yml plus you can have your specific image configuration in the DockerFile. what do you mean by "a project broken down into smal pieces" ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-12T15:21:18] <dragon788> w0rldart: you basically define dependencies between the services in your compose file and it will handle bringing them up in the right order
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-12T17:46:26] <dragon788> yup,  the nice part about Docker is you get the "same network" for free, unless you want additional isolation in which case you can add that, but you can also limit the amount of things you need to start if you do only link the directly dependent containers, once you do a link you can easily reference the various services without having to know IPs (great for portability)

1 [2017-04-13T10:46:27] <MaxGoh> Hi guys. How can I use Docker with Angular CLI? I want to be able to build my app and push it to a production docker container that is serving nginx as well.
2 [2017-04-13T10:47:08] <MaxGoh> So the problem is, I want to build a dist folder in the docker container, and during development
3 [2017-04-13T10:47:20] <MaxGoh> I would be able to watch the folder and serve the webapp
4 [2017-04-13T10:47:35] <MaxGoh> Anyone could provide some guidance on how I could do this?
5 [2017-04-13T11:36:44] <MaxGoh> carljmosca: Thanks for that, didn’t know I can read other’s dockerfile.
6 [2017-04-13T11:36:51] <MaxGoh> But anyway, what’s the point of building images?
7 [2017-04-13T11:37:01] <MaxGoh> Isn’t everything run via docker-compose?
8 [2017-04-13T11:37:07] <MaxGoh> Why would I build an image?
9 [2017-04-13T11:48:53] <MaxGoh> Yes! Haha
10 [2017-04-13T11:49:03] <MaxGoh> I don’t quite understand the docs, despite reading them countless times.
11 [2017-04-13T11:49:21] <MaxGoh> I could just do a docker-compose up and it all runs nicely
12 [2017-04-13T11:49:25] <MaxGoh> And there’s no image that is built
13 [2017-04-13T11:49:36] <pecigonzalo> That is correct, the image is to distribute
14 [2017-04-13T11:49:51] <MaxGoh> So if I’m only using it for myself
15 [2017-04-13T11:49:54] <pecigonzalo> EG: distribute a base NGINX instalation like thenginxone
16 [2017-04-13T11:49:55] <MaxGoh> There’s no need to build images?
17 [2017-04-13T11:50:03] <pecigonzalo> if its just for running locally, there might be no point
18 [2017-04-13T11:50:18] <pecigonzalo> unless you need to "store" a base image
19 [2017-04-13T11:50:24] <pecigonzalo> EG: i built myself a SBT image
20 [2017-04-13T11:50:28] <MaxGoh> SBT?
21 [2017-04-13T11:50:38] <pecigonzalo> scala stuff, for running builds
22 [2017-04-13T11:50:51] <pecigonzalo> so then i use that trough compose in other projects
23 [2017-04-13T11:51:06] <MaxGoh> Oh
24 [2017-04-13T11:51:09] <MaxGoh> Um
25 [2017-04-13T11:51:15] <MaxGoh> So in my docker compose
26 [2017-04-13T11:51:20] <MaxGoh> I don’t really need a image: right
27 [2017-04-13T11:51:54] <pecigonzalo> On the contrary, lets say you build your own NGINX image, in your compose you just reference that, instead of running a build
28 [2017-04-13T11:52:23] <pecigonzalo> now, i dont understand if you use i locally or on a server, or want to deploy, as you mentioned before:I want to be able to build my app and push it to a production docker container that is serving nginx as well.
29 [2017-04-13T11:52:35] <MaxGoh> Um
30 [2017-04-13T11:52:46] <MaxGoh> Okay, let me try to explain in depth okay?
31 [2017-04-13T11:52:49] <pecigonzalo> Sure!
32 [2017-04-13T11:52:53] <MaxGoh> Cause I have been stuck on this quite long
33 [2017-04-13T11:52:58] <MaxGoh> and I’m really appreciating your help right nw
34 [2017-04-13T11:53:01] <MaxGoh> now*
35 [2017-04-13T11:53:04] <MaxGoh> Okay here goes
36 [2017-04-13T12:05:10] <pecigonzalo> Im trying to look for a tutorial that will explain the steps
37 [2017-04-13T12:08:49] <pecigonzalo> Saeed, i think you are just jumping between things and assuming his knowledge of all this stuff

2 [2017-04-13T10:56:30] <Asiddiki> Lets say when I am using docker images  i am gettingREPOSITORY       TAG               IMAGE ID              CREATED                  SIZEHello                       world           136ase5f2bb       1 days ago              50MBNow i want this Hello:world as  Hi:Example

1 [2017-04-13T11:48:34] <carljmosca> MaxGoh: I am not sure I can sufficiently answer that in a few short lines.  Containerization has many benefits…portability, lower overhead, simplfied maintenance, etc.  Ultimately, your image can be deployed (as a container) to  production…is that not your goal?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T11:58:43] <MaxGoh> @pecigonzaloI’m currently getting start to build an Angular web app using Angular-CLI. So my current objective is to implement Docker & Gitlab CI. So right now, my current stage is that I’m able to run a local development container that is able to compile during live coding, which is great! (Step 1 complete).Step 2 ) Create a flow for Production, and the way production works is that I have a command call ng build, which watches the folder and compiles a dist/ folder. I would like to COPY that in the container, and use nginx to serve it.Step 3/4 would be similar, which is to have a flow where I can to stimulate like my local laptop is the server itself so I can run it and test it out if it works (development and production)
2 [2017-04-13T11:59:24] <MaxGoh> Sorry if it’s alittle vague. I’m really not familiar with the Docker scene. But I’m really happy I got into it
3 [2017-04-13T12:04:09] <MaxGoh> Dockerfile first then work on docker-compose?
4 [2017-04-13T12:07:17] <MaxGoh> Do I have to care about ‘images’ as I’m not really planning to build any image
5 [2017-04-13T12:07:27] <MaxGoh> and stuff like nginx, I will just use FROM nginx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T12:03:38] <hatrena> For any command line you can use DockerFile to execute the sh file through CMD command. then it execute all your necessary commands in your sh file after your container is ready
2 [2017-04-13T12:05:16] <hatrena> docker-composer is just a way to link services at one, you can link many images which each has its own dockerfile
3 [2017-04-13T12:08:13] <hatrena> once you use "FROM" ngin, you just need EXPOSE it in the DockerFile
4 [2017-04-13T12:08:56] <hatrena> i don\'t get you by "caring about" images
5 [2017-04-13T12:09:42] <hatrena> that the thing, these are very generic concepts, and circumstances are totally different between scenarios
6 [2017-04-13T12:10:29] <hatrena> we need very specific question.
7 [2017-04-13T12:10:54] <MaxGoh> Hm
8 [2017-04-13T12:11:05] <MaxGoh> It might be because I have been jumping around the docs
9 [2017-04-13T12:11:15] <MaxGoh> And now my understanding of docker is pretty jumbled up
10 [2017-04-13T12:13:32] <pecigonzalo> writing something, 1 moment
11 [2017-04-13T12:14:57] <MaxGoh> Cool
12 [2017-04-13T12:26:22] <pecigonzalo> lets see if it fits
13 [2017-04-13T12:26:33] <pecigonzalo> @MaxGohA docker image is always use when you use dockerEG: [<-CODE->] You are using the nginx:latest image.Images are used to "bundle" things up and distribute, think of it like a "zip" file in a way.Dockerfiles are used for building docker imagesEG: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Now, lets say i want to serve some static content that i have on my html folder using NGINX, ill create the following: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-04-13T12:30:55] <pecigonzalo> Now, with this in mind, as it was mentioned before, the workflow for your particular app really depends on how you build it and how you run it, a good idea would be to as mentioned in my example build an image out of your Angular application and somehow (by the registry or otherwise) get it to your production server and run it there. How to build your app, really depends on your workflow and the type of app your are running.You can use this as a good example: [<-LINK->]
15 [2017-04-13T12:31:36] <MaxGoh> Thanks@pecigonzalo! I’m going to read that.
16 [2017-04-13T12:31:48] <pecigonzalo> Np
17 [2017-04-13T12:32:01] <pecigonzalo> Hope it helps
18 [2017-04-13T12:32:05] <hatrena> Well said@pecigonzalo
19 [2017-04-13T12:34:20] <pecigonzalo> <3
20 [2017-04-13T12:44:40] <pecigonzalo> Oh by the way, found this the other day@MaxGohv
21 [2017-04-13T12:44:41] <pecigonzalo>  [<-LINK->]
22 [2017-04-13T12:44:48] <pecigonzalo> could help you get started and learning
23 [2017-04-13T12:46:54] <MaxGoh> pecigonzalo: Sorry! I was in a skype call earlier.
24 [2017-04-13T12:47:02] <MaxGoh> Thanks for the write-up and the URL. I'm reading them now!
25 [2017-04-13T12:54:17] <MaxGoh> pecigonzalo: Hey, what if I don’t have a DockerHub account
26 [2017-04-13T12:54:35] <MaxGoh> I can’t do a docker push, so where I can’t grab image: yeah?
27 [2017-04-13T12:57:20] <pecigonzalo> If you dont have a DockerHub account you cant push to the dockerhub, so you can just run locally build images or other public images on the hub
28 [2017-04-13T12:57:34] <MaxGoh> Haha yup
29 [2017-04-13T12:57:42] <MaxGoh> But I feel alot clearer after reading your write-up
30 [2017-04-13T12:57:46] <MaxGoh> One thing would be key
31 [2017-04-13T12:57:50] <MaxGoh> environment variables
32 [2017-04-13T12:58:02] <MaxGoh> How does that work though? I saw some files that says
33 [2017-04-13T12:58:10] <MaxGoh> environment:-DEBUG=1
34 [2017-04-13T12:58:18] <pecigonzalo> You will need an account or your own registry to be able to push somewhere, otherwise, you candocker image saveto save an image and thendocker image importto import it somewhere else
35 [2017-04-13T12:58:45] <MaxGoh> Understood
36 [2017-04-13T12:58:49] <pecigonzalo> in thedocker-compose.ymlfile?
37 [2017-04-13T12:58:52] <MaxGoh> Yes
38 [2017-04-13T12:59:06] <MaxGoh> As I think that might be key for me to set multile environments?
39 [2017-04-13T12:59:12] <pecigonzalo> they are basically environment variables passed to the command that you run, like bash environment variables
40 [2017-04-13T12:59:33] <pecigonzalo> everything you can do on compose, you can do on regulardockercli
41 [2017-04-13T12:59:48] <MaxGoh> so say I wanna do a docker-compose up —prod?
42 [2017-04-13T12:59:53] <MaxGoh> or docker-compose up —dev
43 [2017-04-13T13:00:15] <pecigonzalo> docker run -e DEBUG=1 -e THISVAR=false nginxfor doing vars from docker cli
44 [2017-04-13T13:00:42] <MaxGoh> Haha
45 [2017-04-13T13:00:52] <pecigonzalo> docker-compose upwill just bring the declaration on thedocker-compose.ymlfile
46 [2017-04-13T13:00:54] <MaxGoh> Okay this part is pretty confusing
47 [2017-04-13T13:01:05] <pecigonzalo> you can have multiple vars by just having
48 [2017-04-13T13:01:10] <MaxGoh> Just like docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 -v html:/usr/share/nginx/html MyStaticSite:latest
49 [2017-04-13T13:01:20] <MaxGoh> I should read the man page and understand stuff like -it —rm
50 [2017-04-13T13:01:26] <pecigonzalo>  [<-CODE->]
51 [2017-04-13T13:01:39] <pecigonzalo> yes, that will be idea
52 [2017-04-13T13:01:48] <pecigonzalo> rundocker run --help
53 [2017-04-13T13:02:04] <MaxGoh> But, say I set DEBUG=1
54 [2017-04-13T13:02:14] <MaxGoh> How does that dictate it to be production or development?
55 [2017-04-13T13:02:47] <pecigonzalo> unless you have 2 service declarations on yourdocker-compose.ymlyou cant
56 [2017-04-13T13:02:53] <pecigonzalo> ondocker-compose up
57 [2017-04-13T13:02:54] <MaxGoh> I see
58 [2017-04-13T13:03:01] <MaxGoh> I read to use production.yml
59 [2017-04-13T13:03:12] <MaxGoh> as in docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f production.yml
60 [2017-04-13T13:03:14] <MaxGoh> is the way to do it haha
61 [2017-04-13T13:03:19] <pecigonzalo> you can overwrite if you dodocker-compose run -e DEBUG=0 MyStaticSite
62 [2017-04-13T13:03:37] <pecigonzalo> Oh yeah, you could use that, but i was trying to avoid the "chaining" of docker-compose files
63 [2017-04-13T13:03:52] <pecigonzalo> as it might make it more complex for a begginer
64 [2017-04-13T13:05:15] <MaxGoh> I just saw the training website
65 [2017-04-13T13:05:19] <MaxGoh> I’m going to play with it haha!
66 [2017-04-13T13:05:22] <MaxGoh> I see.
67 [2017-04-13T13:05:45] <pecigonzalo> this guys [<-LINK->] also have nice interactive trainigns
68 [2017-04-13T13:05:57] <MaxGoh> Wow
69 [2017-04-13T13:05:59] <MaxGoh> Cool
70 [2017-04-13T13:06:23] <pecigonzalo> alsodocker-compose.ymlsupports variable interpolation
71 [2017-04-13T13:06:35] <MaxGoh> Which means?
72 [2017-04-13T13:07:50] <pecigonzalo> so you can do this [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
73 [2017-04-13T13:08:15] <MaxGoh> What does that affect though
74 [2017-04-13T13:08:16] <MaxGoh> As in
75 [2017-04-13T13:08:24] <MaxGoh> I understand I would set DEBUG=0
76 [2017-04-13T13:08:32] <MaxGoh> Is something awaiting the DEBUG value?
77 [2017-04-13T13:08:45] <pecigonzalo> Well, it depends on your app, i was just giving you an example
78 [2017-04-13T13:09:03] <pecigonzalo> lets say you have something that i the Evironment variable DEBUG is set to 1 prints debug logs
79 [2017-04-13T13:09:08] <MaxGoh> I see
80 [2017-04-13T13:09:18] <MaxGoh> So I have to code that out as in my angular app?
81 [2017-04-13T13:09:24] <MaxGoh> It’s not exactly Docker related yes?
82 [2017-04-13T13:09:35] <pecigonzalo> I was giving it as an example in the case oyu had different stuff for prod, you can also interpolate
83 [2017-04-13T13:09:39] <pecigonzalo> correct
84 [2017-04-13T13:09:48] <pecigonzalo> its just environment varialbes
85 [2017-04-13T13:09:54] <pecigonzalo> like any other application
86 [2017-04-13T13:10:46] <MaxGoh> I see!
87 [2017-04-13T13:11:41] <pecigonzalo> if you dont want to use interpolation, you can use what you mentioned before (or a combination of both)
88 [2017-04-13T13:11:51] <MaxGoh> Okayy
89 [2017-04-13T13:12:08] <MaxGoh> pecigonzalo: I’m going to play around with the interactive training to get a better feel of Docker
90 [2017-04-13T13:12:18] <MaxGoh> I just wanna say a huge thank you man.
91 [2017-04-13T13:12:20] <MaxGoh> Really appreciate.
92 [2017-04-13T13:12:43] <pecigonzalo> NP! hope you get into it, docker is really cool!
93 [2017-04-13T13:12:52] <MaxGoh> I am definitely getting into it
94 [2017-04-13T13:12:56] <MaxGoh> Nothing’s gonna stop me haha!

1 [2017-04-13T14:42:28] <autosquid> hi, I have a program written and tested on mac, and now I want to make it easy to distribute -- can docker help in this case?
2 [2017-04-13T14:46:32] <pecigonzalo> I theory, ye
3 [2017-04-13T14:46:32] <pecigonzalo> s
4 [2017-04-13T14:46:36] <pecigonzalo> but its not a given
5 [2017-04-13T14:46:43] <pecigonzalo> what is the program written on?
6 [2017-04-13T14:46:58] <autosquid> mac
7 [2017-04-13T14:47:07] <pecigonzalo> Mac is the OS, but what language
8 [2017-04-13T14:47:15] <autosquid> a mix of python and c++
9 [2017-04-13T14:48:04] <pecigonzalo> Honestly, its a really broad question, in general Docker can help you either distribute it inside a docker image or at least compile it for different platforms.
10 [2017-04-13T14:48:32] <pecigonzalo> If you are using OSX specific things, then no, docker is not going to help "transport" that
11 [2017-04-13T14:49:02] <autosquid> Indeed, there is something specific to OSX
12 [2017-04-13T14:49:19] <pecigonzalo> Then AFAIK docker is not going to magically "solve" that
13 [2017-04-13T14:49:30] <pecigonzalo> maybe someone else knows different
14 [2017-04-13T14:49:35] <autosquid> so I am wondering if there is something like an "osx image"?
15 [2017-04-13T14:50:04] <autosquid> so that I can build the program based on the "osx image"
16 [2017-04-13T14:51:20] <pecigonzalo> No, unfortunately not at this time as far as i know, OSX also has a different kernel and this complicates things
17 [2017-04-13T14:55:11] <autosquid> even for docker for Mac?
18 [2017-04-13T14:55:28] <pecigonzalo> docker for mac, unless something changed, uses a linux vm to run docker
19 [2017-04-13T14:56:12] <autosquid> aha, I see.
20 [2017-04-13T14:57:00] <autosquid> xhyve runs a linux vm though it is for osx.
21 [2017-04-13T14:59:38] <autosquid> got it. Thanks!
22 [2017-04-13T15:00:49] <autosquid> I though "docker for mac" would run a vm with the same kernel as the host.
23 [2017-04-13T15:00:56] <autosquid> I was wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T14:48:08] <autosquid> when writing the program, I considered how to build it on osx, which makes it hard to transport to linux/windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T14:57:03] <andyneff> So "docker for mac" will allow you to run a linux specific docker image. So if you can convert your code to a linux specific image, then docker will help you
2 [2017-04-13T15:09:14] <andyneff> Unfortunately, no. I had high hopes when the BSD added the linux support, that MAYBE someday Mac OSX would too. But it looks unlikely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T18:56:49] <rcreasey> So I have a really odd problem.  I use docker to do different build chain compiles (ie: i have a container with gcc 4.1 and another with 4.8).  Those containers run on my build host that has an autofs mount to remote artifact storage (build artifacts go here)
2 [2017-04-13T18:57:17] <rcreasey> when I run the my buildchain container, it will volume mount onto the host's autofs mount point
3 [2017-04-13T18:58:06] <rcreasey> On rare occasions I've had my builds fail becausedocker: Error response from daemon: mkdir /mnt/artifacts: file exists
4 [2017-04-13T18:58:33] <rcreasey> presumably because i'm doingdocker run -v /mnt/artifacts:/artifacts gcc4.1chain build
5 [2017-04-13T18:59:32] <rcreasey> and docker seems to want to try and create the path if it doesn't exist when the command is executed
6 [2017-04-13T21:30:57] <dragon788> etsuo: probably firewall it with iptables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T20:10:55] <etsuo> hi, is there a way to block a specific container from sending smtp?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-13T22:17:51] <etsuo> dragon788: thanks for the feedback - the problem is that these containers are being managed by AWS ECS - they get launched dynamically on demand and they might get moved around… I need some way of defining on the container itself that it should block outbound port 25… it looks like —cap-add with the right options might have given me the ability to turn on IP tables within the container… but that’s not supported by AWS ECS for some insane reason
2 [2017-04-13T22:28:10] <SISheogorath> etsuo: doesn't ECS also allow security groups?
3 [2017-04-13T22:29:01] <etsuo> SISheogorath: yes, the problem is that’s all or nothing… I need to constrain a set of containers in the cluster to disallow them from using port 25 while not blocking the other containers
4 [2017-04-13T22:32:45] <etsuo> what’s crazy is that AWS didn’t implement the —cap-add flags, but the went ahead and gave us —privileged… but that just seems foolish to run that on a production container to get iptables access so I can secure the container from sending smtp… so to prevent smtp, I make my container less secure… ?? thanks amazon

1 [2017-04-15T12:14:34] <yuvgeek> how to deploy the newly pushed code hosted at GitHub to our production server ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-15T14:55:02] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: that's something you have to define in your deployment process.Depending on what your setup looks like you may want to use TravisCI, circleCI Docker hub, Docker Cloud, ... In combination with Ansible, SaltStack, Puppet, Chef or a Shell script with SSH, ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-15T15:43:16] <dancancro> Is this statement above true? "This chat is intended for contributors new to the Docker project or new to open source.

1 [2017-04-15T21:03:57] <MaxGoh> Hey guys, how can i create a docker-compose file to link up nginx and my dist folder?
2 [2017-04-15T21:04:01] <MaxGoh> It’s 2 different container yeah
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-15T22:20:38] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: why not use node as base image?
2 [2017-04-15T22:21:03] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: two different containers who use the same data?
3 [2017-04-15T22:21:24] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: I’m assuming to use one container for nginx, another for angular
4 [2017-04-15T22:21:32] <MaxGoh> and I want to then copy my angular dist files to the nginx folder
5 [2017-04-15T22:21:47] <MaxGoh> am I right to do that?
6 [2017-04-15T22:21:56] <MaxGoh> and hopefully from there, i can use elastic-beanstalk to deploy
7 [2017-04-15T22:28:15] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: I would recommend you to build the angular App duringdocker buildprocess. As angular doesn't provide any server-side code, so put it into an own container makes only sense as long as you want to develop and rebuild it on the fly
8 [2017-04-15T22:28:44] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: I’m using docker-compose to develop locally
9 [2017-04-15T22:28:51] <MaxGoh> which is working pretty nicely for now
10 [2017-04-15T22:28:55] <MaxGoh> and I don’t need nginx for it
11 [2017-04-15T22:29:01] <MaxGoh> but I wanna use docker in my ec2 instance
12 [2017-04-15T22:29:14] <MaxGoh> and entire flow from gitlab-ci to elastic beanstalk
13 [2017-04-15T22:31:09] <MaxGoh> docker-compose build?
14 [2017-04-15T22:31:11] <MaxGoh> or docker build?
15 [2017-04-15T22:31:19] <SISheogorath> Docker build
16 [2017-04-15T22:31:23] <MaxGoh> because it’s going to be a multi container
17 [2017-04-15T22:31:29] <MaxGoh> shouldn’t it be docker-compose?
18 [2017-04-15T22:31:50] <MaxGoh> wait, am I being correct to use multiple container? one for nginx one for angular?
19 [2017-04-15T22:31:56] <MaxGoh> or should i merge them together
20 [2017-04-15T22:34:34] <SISheogorath> You should do it similar to this: [<-LINK->]
21 [2017-04-15T22:35:17] <SISheogorath> It's an example Dockerfile to build a Jekyll webpage on the nginx image to provide it in production
22 [2017-04-15T22:35:34] <MaxGoh> but i need to build my files first
23 [2017-04-15T22:35:37] <MaxGoh> using ng build
24 [2017-04-15T22:35:46] <MaxGoh> so that dist can be generated
25 [2017-04-15T22:36:34] <SISheogorath> That's what I do in this dockerfile for Jekyll
26 [2017-04-15T22:36:52] <MaxGoh> you copy . /app
27 [2017-04-15T22:37:04] <MaxGoh> but dont’ i have to
28 [2017-04-15T22:37:10] <MaxGoh> npm install && ng build?
29 [2017-04-15T22:37:12] <MaxGoh> hm
30 [2017-04-15T22:37:26] <SISheogorath> Because it's Jekyll not angular
31 [2017-04-15T22:37:32] <SISheogorath> And app are the sources
32 [2017-04-15T22:38:29] <SISheogorath> I only wanted to show you the basic concept
33 [2017-04-15T22:38:37] <MaxGoh> understood
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-15T22:30:47] <SISheogorath> For a productive setup build your app in your final image, containing the webserver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-15T22:38:47] <MaxGoh> so should i have another docker container to build my angular app?
2 [2017-04-15T22:39:52] <SISheogorath> No, do it during the build process inside your Dockerfile and base it on nginx
3 [2017-04-16T05:12:43] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: sorry, so I have to install node and nginx in the same dockerfile?
4 [2017-04-16T09:26:00] <SISheogorath> thebuccaneersden: as sad as it is, there is no really common way to do it. Feel free to share yours it you want
5 [2017-04-16T09:28:45] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: maybe check out [<-LINK->] way more useful than Ubuntu as base image and improves caching
6 [2017-04-16T09:32:26] <SISheogorath> And it highly depends on what you are about to do. Having Dockerfile and sources in they same repository is very nice. In this case copy the sources. If you have separated repositories, use git clone or install tarballs (official best practices) of releases.
7 [2017-04-16T09:38:05] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: as you need NodeJS only to build your application, install all needed packages and also NodeJS into your container, which is based on nginx. Build your application, copy the build results into/var/www/html/and delete the source directory. Also delete NodeJS and clean the package cache. At the end (docker diff) only the/var/www/htmldirectory should have changed (containing your application)
8 [2017-04-16T11:48:57] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: it's mostly about sharing layers between your nodes. Also you can very easy specify what exact version you want to install. The official best practice says you should use the language your application is written in as base container, if one is available for it. Reasons: 1. You can update the version by changing the from line 2. They are kept up-to-date but without breaking 3. base image is cached so if you run 10 applications using node:6.10 you only download it once. Results in smaller images
9 [2017-04-16T11:50:22] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: depends on your setup. Is it a single host? A swarm? A K8s cluster? A K8s Cluster managed by Amazon?
10 [2017-04-16T11:50:36] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: just a simple nginx haha
11 [2017-04-16T11:50:43] <MaxGoh> Not that advanced to use stuffs like swarm
12 [2017-04-16T11:51:04] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: I was talking about the EC2 instance not what you are about to deploy xD
13 [2017-04-16T11:51:15] <MaxGoh> oops
14 [2017-04-16T11:51:19] <MaxGoh> Is there differences?
15 [2017-04-16T11:51:24] <MaxGoh> I’m just using the normal instance ubuntu 16.04
16 [2017-04-16T11:51:30] <SISheogorath> Ah okay
17 [2017-04-16T11:52:25] <SISheogorath> Well, first of all are you using docker-compose on your instance?
18 [2017-04-16T11:52:31] <MaxGoh> that’s right! :)
19 [2017-04-16T11:52:41] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: I wasn't talking about Node
20 [2017-04-16T11:53:06] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: same applies to python, go, ruby, ...
21 [2017-04-16T11:53:23] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: You can use a shellscript or ansible
22 [2017-04-16T11:53:32] <MaxGoh> I’m using gitlab
23 [2017-04-16T11:53:40] <MaxGoh> shell script as in bash script?
24 [2017-04-16T11:53:44] <SISheogorath> yes
25 [2017-04-16T11:54:00] <MaxGoh> what would i DO WITH THAT? O.O
26 [2017-04-16T11:54:42] <MaxGoh> oops
27 [2017-04-16T11:54:47] <MaxGoh> what would I do with that? as in
28 [2017-04-16T11:54:51] <MaxGoh> install aws cli or something?
29 [2017-04-16T11:54:59] <MaxGoh> I’m using GItlab CI
30 [2017-04-16T11:55:09] <SISheogorath> doesn't matter
31 [2017-04-16T11:55:13] <MaxGoh> is there a way for me to do a push to git, and CI/CD?
32 [2017-04-16T11:55:23] <SISheogorath> O.o
33 [2017-04-16T11:56:17] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: oh wait I think I mixed up conversations in my head :D sry ^^
34 [2017-04-16T11:57:07] <MaxGoh> I’m confused haha
35 [2017-04-16T11:57:12] <MaxGoh> Which message is to who now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T06:51:58] <yuvgeek> Which is best approach? git clone in docker file or ?
2 [2017-04-16T06:52:41] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: Ubuntu 16.04 is my base image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T07:40:47] <thebuccaneersden> nice. I finally got a fully end to end pass of docker container that gets built through travis ci for the armhf arch and automatically tagged and pushed to dockerhub. that was a fun challenge, but I’m wondering if there is a general convention that the community follows? or does everyone have their own unique way of doing this (automating bulding of docker containers and automatically pushing them to dockerhub on build success)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T11:44:13] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: When we clone from GitHub repo in Dockerfile, it has to be re-build..so what happen at the down time?
2 [2017-04-16T11:44:34] <yuvgeek> because when container is already running, we have to stop and re-create
3 [2017-04-16T11:45:05] <yuvgeek> those down time when we clone and build the new docker image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T11:45:25] <MaxGoh> Um you guys know how to deploy from gitlab CI to AWS EC2?
2 [2017-04-16T11:45:28] <MaxGoh> for docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T11:54:53] <SISheogorath> simply use something to ssh to your machine and pull the git repository containing your updated docker-compose file (for the new version you want to deploy) rundocker-compose  pull && docker-compose up -d
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T11:55:29] <yuvgeek> We use docker-compose to create container. Container per service. So, Apache/nginx uses 1 container, mysql uses another container. We use gitlab CI. Suppose if we make changes in Dockerfile and code repo and pushing a code to gitlab, it will perform the build test and in deploy it will  create new images and pushes to dockerRegistry.
2 [2017-04-16T11:55:57] <yuvgeek> Through web hook, we tell our production server running to rebuild the image with changed source code
3 [2017-04-16T11:56:58] <yuvgeek> Generally, we will stop the running container and pull the latest image from registry and rebuild it. So, when we use git clone..it will take time during the build process.
4 [2017-04-16T11:57:10] <yuvgeek> Meanwhile, our app will go down right? Downtime.
5 [2017-04-16T11:57:29] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: Yeah..thats why i am explaining you clearly.
6 [2017-04-16T11:57:38] <yuvgeek> Hope you understood atleast now :D
7 [2017-04-16T11:57:59] <yuvgeek> hey@MaxGoh, how do you deploy from gitlab ci?
8 [2017-04-16T11:58:05] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: you shouldn't rebuild the image. You should use the same image you tested in your production because a newly build image is not proven to work
9 [2017-04-16T11:58:28] <SISheogorath> And you can pull before for you stop the container :D
10 [2017-04-16T11:58:36] <SISheogorath> that would minimize the downtime
11 [2017-04-16T11:58:39] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: Gitlab CI runs that test.
12 [2017-04-16T11:58:54] <yuvgeek> but still it is a down time right
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T11:58:41] <MaxGoh> do you guys mind explaining a proper deployment flow?
2 [2017-04-16T11:59:09] <SISheogorath> if you want to eliminate the downtime completely you should run docker swarm with more than 1 instance of your application
3 [2017-04-16T11:59:36] <yuvgeek> Docker swarm for mid level apps?
4 [2017-04-16T11:59:58] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: you need it if you want 0 downtime
5 [2017-04-16T12:00:43] <yuvgeek> MaxGoh: do you use CI? if so, once it goes to deploy stage, you have to push the new image and trigger the production server through hook to apply new changes.
6 [2017-04-16T12:00:55] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: Ahh
7 [2017-04-16T12:01:43] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: the problem is that when you recreate the container it works like a restart of a regular application. There you have also downtime on restart :D
8 [2017-04-16T12:01:43] <yuvgeek> is that correct approach cloning our source code in docker image?
9 [2017-04-16T12:02:10] <yuvgeek> Yea i understood@SISheogorath.
10 [2017-04-16T12:02:29] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: as already mentioned it depends. I personally prefer copy when I keep the Dockerfile in the same repository as the source code
11 [2017-04-16T12:03:00] <yuvgeek> where you hosted your source repo?
12 [2017-04-16T12:03:48] <SISheogorath> reason: Versioncontrol. The Dockerfile and the sources stay in the same commit and it's better to copy the source inside because you don't need to reference it during your build process.
13 [2017-04-16T12:05:12] <SISheogorath> msgeissler: use [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-04-16T12:05:24] <SISheogorath> not with dash
15 [2017-04-16T12:06:34] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: on Github? But as I use a lot of software not written by me I have a lot of repositories whom are separated from the original sources, there I clone the sources during build process
16 [2017-04-16T12:20:02] <yuvgeek> Okay
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T12:03:40] <msgeissler> hey everyone,can someone give me a hand with the docker-compose format?I have the following compose file [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I just can't find the reason for the error
2 [2017-04-16T12:06:39] <msgeissler> still the same error :(@SISheogorath
3 [2017-04-16T12:07:28] <msgeissler> official documentation is sadly only showing version 2 examples in the version 3 reference documentation
4 [2017-04-16T12:08:46] <msgeissler> but other examples I have found online using version 3 show the dash notation
5 [2017-04-16T12:09:27] <SISheogorath> msgeissler: can you check this: [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-04-16T12:09:49] <msgeissler> the Example Compose file version 3 [<-LINK->] shows the dash variant as well
7 [2017-04-16T12:11:20] <msgeissler> SISheogorath: your snippet gives me the same error
8 [2017-04-16T12:11:53] <msgeissler> I am using Docker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e btw
9 [2017-04-16T12:13:35] <msgeissler> 17.04.0-ce does not seem to be available for ubuntu xenial yet
10 [2017-04-16T12:14:31] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: O.o I don't see your problem. Your application should be build like you do normally and be configured by environment variables which configure your docker container once it's landed in production.
11 [2017-04-16T12:15:31] <SISheogorath> msgeissler: yes, to be honest I tried it like this a few times, always ended up in an error message so I droped it and always use thenetworkname:way.
12 [2017-04-16T12:16:11] <msgeissler> so it would be worth creating an issue for this?
13 [2017-04-16T12:16:41] <msgeissler> SISheogorath: do you have an example for the usage of networkname? I can't find it in the docker compose reference
14 [2017-04-16T12:17:22] <SISheogorath> msgeissler: I found the issue :D
15 [2017-04-16T12:17:24] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
16 [2017-04-16T12:17:30] <SISheogorath> check the last change ^^
17 [2017-04-16T12:18:03] <SISheogorath> you setnetworkone level too deep
18 [2017-04-16T12:18:49] <msgeissler> oh shi*
19 [2017-04-16T12:19:24] <msgeissler> SISheogorath: thanks a bunch, I probably would have wasted a ton more hours before I would have noticed that :D
20 [2017-04-16T12:19:43] <SISheogorath> you're welcome ^^
21 [2017-04-16T12:21:07] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: maybe you can file an example then I can suggest something
22 [2017-04-16T12:23:02] <yuvgeek> Can you be bit more clear?
23 [2017-04-16T12:30:08] <SISheogorath> well, where you are unsure about cloning the repository vs.COPYin dockerfile
24 [2017-04-16T16:59:19] <SISheogorath> MKiselev: Traefik is nearly perfect if you want to use it with docker. And also take a look at jwilders nginx image. HAproxy is also use by rancher for their setup iirc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T12:06:31] <yuvgeek> yeah.. our code hosted in gitlab and GitHub. We have Dockerfile along with source code. Also we have some files in .gitignore. how should we handle this approach? bringing source code from gitlab/github to our production server along with files which are in gitignore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T15:55:36] <MaksimKiselev> Hi guys. What you are use for reverse proxy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T16:07:42] <thebuccaneersden> I more often than not use varnish@MKiselev, but sometimes haproxy
2 [2017-04-16T17:01:23] <thebuccaneersden> havent played with traefik. heard nice things about it recently, but cant recommend without trying it
3 [2017-04-16T17:01:37] <thebuccaneersden> seems like it was made with docker in mind
4 [2017-04-16T17:02:45] <SISheogorath> thebuccaneersden: yes, made as API based proxy with dynamic reconfiguration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T17:07:09] <MaksimKiselev> SISheogorath: @thebuccaneersdenyep, right now we use nginx-proxy... But today I was found Traefik project and wanted to know who what use more. Maybe Traefik has killer features vs nginx-proxy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T17:12:37] <thebuccaneersden> oh ya, i forgot about nginx as well, the swiss army tool of do whatever you want
2 [2017-04-16T17:14:05] <thebuccaneersden> well, hard to say. the thing that would strike me is that traefik is a younger project, so it may have better features, but at the same time, hasnt been tested out in the wild for as long
3 [2017-04-16T22:13:16] <thebuccaneersden> gitlab is buggy in general imo
4 [2017-04-16T22:13:30] <thebuccaneersden> is why i decided to go with gogs (or gitea, a fork)@msgeissler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T17:23:54] <msgeissler> I used nginx-proxy in the past for my private projects ( [<-LINK->] ) but recently swtiched to traefik as well
2 [2017-04-16T19:38:59] <msgeissler> it also works with docker swarm, although it seems like it is buggy (i.e. gitlab generates wrong avatar and project logo URLs in swarm mode with traefik)but the letsencrypt support works like a charm (so far)
3 [2017-04-16T20:42:54] <msgeissler> huh, did some more testing, looks like the URL problem isn't traefik's fault after allgitlab is buggy deployed on swarm, so go ahead and use traefik for docker swarm :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T17:36:19] <SISheogorath> MKiselev: I would hardly recommend Traefik as it provides automatically reconfigure itself based on docker API along with let's encrypt and more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T22:18:28] <thesamet> docker on mac trick question: is there any way to make a container mount a directory on the docker VM? It would be nice to have some directory on the VM to be persisted between runs, since filesystem access between docker and the mac is really slow
2 [2017-04-16T22:18:57] <thebuccaneersden> volumes: ?
3 [2017-04-16T22:20:02] <thebuccaneersden>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-04-16T22:20:05] <thebuccaneersden> thesamet:
5 [2017-04-16T22:21:45] <thesamet> thebuccaneersden: this is showing how to mount a directory from the Mac OS filesystem, not from the Docker VM.
6 [2017-04-16T22:22:23] <thebuccaneersden> so you want to mount a directory from the docker container to the host?
7 [2017-04-16T22:25:46] <thesamet> On Mac, docker runs a Linux virtual machine which is where the docker daemon actually runs. I want to make a directory on that virtual machine available to a container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T22:36:31] <thebuccaneersden> thesamet: Are you running an old version of docker-engine on the mac? Because, docker no longer requires virtual box and supports native virtualization called hyperkit
2 [2017-04-16T22:36:32] <thebuccaneersden>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-04-16T22:36:45] <thebuccaneersden> just curious
4 [2017-04-16T22:37:28] <thebuccaneersden> whether you are still using virtualbox or native virtualization
5 [2017-04-16T22:39:42] <thesamet> native virtualization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-16T22:41:18] <thebuccaneersden> sorry. i guess i assumed that with native virtualization, the vm was transparent and you can use docker as if you were on linux. no need to thinking of a vm as a middle man. am i wrong in this assumption? (i will give it a test later)
2 [2017-04-16T22:47:28] <thesamet> There's an actual VM, though it's very light weight.
3 [2017-04-16T22:47:52] <thesamet> Apparently it allocates 60GB for disk.
4 [2017-04-16T22:48:08] <thesamet> Here is a command to get into it:docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh
5 [2017-04-16T22:48:21] <thesamet> FWIW, I can probably solve for my use case with named volumes.
6 [2017-04-16T22:48:29] <thebuccaneersden> oh i know, but i assumed it was more like hyperv virtualization, where it doesn’t require fulkl paravirtualization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T11:08:57] <MaksimKiselev> Hi guys. I try to add letsencrypt for my nginx-proxy which installed globally.I found goo sample for docker compose https://github.com/fatk/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion-examples/blob/master/docker-compose/v2/simple-site/docker-compose.ymlBut I can't understand some things....
2 [2017-04-17T12:41:48] <MaksimKiselev> SISheogorath: I reconfigure now globally nginx proxy container and now that's work....
3 [2017-04-17T12:51:45] <MaksimKiselev> Oh shi~. But how off ssl encrypt 4 some containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T11:54:10] <SISheogorath> Wow that's super complicated .-. you use one container to generate nginx configs, one to serve TLS and jwilder's to reverse proxy everything. I would suggest you to use Traefik it's a hundred times simpler .-.

1 [2017-04-17T13:25:57] <jbelmont> Hello All
2 [2017-04-17T13:27:16] <jbelmont> I am trying the following docker.compose.yml [<-CODE->] and Dockerfile [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-04-17T13:27:31] <jbelmont> sorry for the long post here
4 [2017-04-17T13:27:56] <jbelmont> I keep getting connection refused with couchdb when I run with docker
5 [2017-04-17T13:28:21] <jbelmont> error:  Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5984
6 [2017-04-17T13:28:53] <jbelmont> I am using node.js and wrapper library called nano for Couchdb
7 [2017-04-17T13:29:08] <jbelmont> Anyone here know how to fix this possible issue
8 [2017-04-17T13:31:44] <andyneff> I think your nodejs is trying to access the DB locally. When it needs to point to the other docker instead.
9 [2017-04-17T13:33:08] <jbelmont> andyneff: so I am doing the following commandsdocker-compose builddocker-compose up
10 [2017-04-17T13:33:53] <andyneff> It's a problem with your nodejs setup. It needs to access the DB on hostnamedb
11 [2017-04-17T13:34:33] <jbelmont> here is my db setup [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-04-17T13:35:10] <jbelmont> so is the hardcoded value in the nano call the problem@andyneff
13 [2017-04-17T13:35:20] <andyneff> So I'm guessing line 3 needs to say db instead of 127.0.0.1
14 [2017-04-17T13:35:52] <andyneff> That's how it's done [here](
15 [2017-04-17T13:36:42] <andyneff>  [<-LINK->]
16 [2017-04-17T13:38:14] <jbelmont> so@andyneffconst nano = require('nano')(‘db’);are you saying I need to update to this
17 [2017-04-17T13:40:02] <andyneff> const nano = require('nano')(‘ [<-LINK->] );
18 [2017-04-17T13:43:17] <jbelmont> so I updated it to that and see this now
19 [2017-04-17T13:55:18] <jbelmont> db_1   | [info] [<0.105.0>] 172.18.0.3 - - PUT /softwaretesting 401db_1   | [error] [<0.150.0>] Could not open file /usr/local/var/lib/couchdb/softwaretesting.couch: no such file or directorydb_1   | [info] [<0.106.0>] 172.18.0.3 - - GET /softwaretesting/users 404web_1  | error:  Error: no_db_file
20 [2017-04-17T13:55:48] <jbelmont> it is a different message
21 [2017-04-17T14:01:13] <andyneff> Don't know anything about couchdb and I'm not near a computer ;-)
22 [2017-04-17T14:02:13] <jbelmont> andyneff: I appreciate you helping me though thanks, will look into this more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T13:26:58] <andyneff> Hello@jbelmont
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T14:52:36] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: in general you have to use the docker internal networking. Thumb-rules: [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-04-17T14:57:09] <SISheogorath> Also remember that the docs for your couchdb image says it is created in [<-LINK->] . So you have to create the database with our application or by hand if you expose the port (wich you don't do)
3 [2017-04-17T16:42:26] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: you actually don't need theEXPOSEstatement
4 [2017-04-17T16:43:15] <SISheogorath> EXPOSE is mainly used when you do things likedocker run -Pwhich I never did because why should I want to provide a random port?
5 [2017-04-17T16:44:45] <jbelmont> SISheogorath: where should I expose the port in thedocker-compose.yml?
6 [2017-04-17T16:45:13] <SISheogorath> But yes, I add it to my containers to because it allows you to show possible used ports indocker pseven if you lack in documentation
7 [2017-04-17T16:45:31] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: yes. use theports:section
8 [2017-04-17T16:46:11] <SISheogorath> but only if you want to expose them. Otherwise ignore it. As you don't need it for internal networking
9 [2017-04-17T16:46:16] <andyneff> jbelmont: You only need to expose your nodejs port. You don't need to expose the db port. dockers on the same network can already see each other's ports
10 [2017-04-17T16:46:49] <SISheogorath> andyneff: the problem is that he has to create the database when using this couchdb image
11 [2017-04-17T16:47:09] <SISheogorath> and that's why I mentioned that he possibly has to expose the database port to create it
12 [2017-04-17T16:47:10] <andyneff> nodejscan already see all the ports in thedbcontainer without usingexpose
13 [2017-04-17T16:47:34] <jbelmont> here is mydocker-compose.yml [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-04-17T16:48:09] <SISheogorath> delete the second ports line, you don't need it
15 [2017-04-17T16:48:26] <jbelmont> okay
16 [2017-04-17T16:48:36] <SISheogorath> IF you want to expose the port, you have to do that underneath thedbsection
17 [2017-04-17T16:49:17] <andyneff> Also , youmaywant"COUCHDB_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0"if you are using that feature.
18 [2017-04-17T16:49:20] <jbelmont>  [<-CODE->]
19 [2017-04-17T16:49:22] <SISheogorath> but as already mentioned you only need to do this if you want to create the database by hand. Otherwise simply make your NodeJS app create the database if it doesn't exists
20 [2017-04-17T16:49:24] <jbelmont> like this
21 [2017-04-17T16:49:37] <SISheogorath> yes
22 [2017-04-17T16:49:53] <SISheogorath> but delete it after you setup the database
23 [2017-04-17T16:49:59] <jbelmont>  [<-CODE->]
24 [2017-04-17T16:50:11] <SISheogorath> .-.
25 [2017-04-17T16:50:14] <jbelmont> so I am creating the database in a file called db.js in my node app
26 [2017-04-17T16:50:55] <andyneff> jbelmont: for your scenraio, creating the db inside the node app, you do not need to expose the 5984 port. italready workswithout using expose
27 [2017-04-17T16:52:29] <jbelmont> so do you meanconst nano = require('nano')('http://db');something like this
28 [2017-04-17T16:53:01] <jbelmont> I tried running without specifying the port and I was getting connection refused
29 [2017-04-17T16:54:19] <andyneff> So if thedbcontainer  is binding to127.0.0.1I don't think it will work. ( I could be wrong here). I'd have it bind to0.0.0.0so it binds to all IP address, which will include whatever network IP it is given (which is usually a 172.x.y.z).
30 [2017-04-17T16:56:03] <andyneff> So ifCOUCHDB_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESSis for some website admin page that has nothing to do with how the database works, then it doesn't matter. But ifCOUCHDB_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESSis for the database that server on 5894, then it does matter.
31 [2017-04-17T16:57:29] <andyneff> Like@SISheogorathwas saying earlier, the containers still need to talk to each other just like servers do. Servers don\'t talk to each other via localhost(127.0.0.1), they have to use the other IP address. and0.0.0.0simple means "use all of them" inside of the container.
32 [2017-04-17T17:01:09] <jbelmont> sorry for ignorance here@andyneffto bind should I doconst nano =require(‘nano’)(‘http://0.0.0.0');
33 [2017-04-17T17:01:33] <andyneff> No I was talking about the setting in docker-compose.yml
34 [2017-04-17T17:02:17] <andyneff>  [<-CODE->]
35 [2017-04-17T17:02:25] <jbelmont> ah okay
36 [2017-04-17T17:02:48] <jbelmont> well then what shouldconst nano = require('nano')('http://db');this line become
37 [2017-04-17T17:03:12] <andyneff>  [<-CODE->]
38 [2017-04-17T17:03:35] <andyneff> I believe
39 [2017-04-17T17:04:58] <jbelmont> okay and should I keep the ports section in docker-compose.yml [<-CODE->]
40 [2017-04-17T17:05:37] <andyneff> It would be useful for you to keep it during development, and remove it during production.
41 [2017-04-17T17:06:29] <jbelmont> okay
42 [2017-04-17T17:06:50] <andyneff> Well, I gotta hop on a plane in a sec. Anyone going to be in Austin tonight/tommorrow?
43 [2017-04-17T17:07:15] <jbelmont> cool many thanks to@andyneffand@SISheogorathfor helping me I appreciate it
44 [2017-04-17T17:14:12] <SISheogorath> andyneff: Me not but I hope you'll meet a lot of awesome people there :)
45 [2017-04-17T19:12:39] <SISheogorath> ael-g: I'm pretty sure someone was talking about it in the [<-LINK->] but can't say it for sure.
46 [2017-04-17T19:15:01] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: do you still try to create a dockerfile for your app? Is it the one you have on github?
47 [2017-04-17T20:45:42] <SISheogorath> paulius005: usually it has a gateway, wondering why yours doesn't have one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T16:05:06] <andyneff> thesamet: , I believe what you want to do is create a data volume. I do this on docker for Windows all the time to get speed back.
2 [2017-04-17T16:23:35] <andyneff>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T16:40:42] <jbelmont> SISheogorath: thanks for those pointers, yeah I am still trying to learn docker and I will look at the docs again
2 [2017-04-17T16:41:53] <jbelmont> SISheogorath: so could I doEXPOSE 5984in theDockerfile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T17:50:49] <yuvgeek> yarn command not found
2 [2017-04-17T17:51:08] <yuvgeek> same as for npm. NPM command not found
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T18:28:33] <ael-g> Hi Guys! Just a non-code related question: We have AWS ECS, GKE for Kubernetes, isn't there a Swarm As a Service service out there somewhere?
2 [2017-04-17T18:28:50] <ael-g> With persistent volume configured?
3 [2017-04-17T18:29:46] <ael-g> You just come to the cluster with a docker compose file, anddocker stack deployit ?

10 [2017-04-17T20:57:13] <SISheogorath> yes
11 [2017-04-17T20:57:53] <paulius005>  [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-04-17T20:59:40] <SISheogorath> looks fine, I would say yourDNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAINis from somewhere else

22 [2017-04-17T21:42:46] <paulius005> I really appreciate your help :)
23 [2017-04-17T21:57:21] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-17T21:30:26] <SISheogorath> Yes I am. You're problem is not related to docker. It's a normal DNS error. I'm not completely sure about the full issue but it's related to how your DNS requests are answered
2 [2017-04-17T21:31:11] <SISheogorath> it works fine as long as you use 8.8.8.8. you should research this. [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-18T00:21:57] <alexeydemin>  [<-CODE->] I have read tons of manuals and still can't grasp how to run services in a running container automatically. Now I have to attach to each and run it manually.
2 [2017-04-18T00:22:21] <alexeydemin> Hi, first of all.
3 [2017-04-18T21:56:21] <alexeydemin> SISheogorath: thank you for your reply, I read them again, but still didn't find an answer to my question.

1 [2017-04-18T00:32:29] <realisation> Can anyone give me some momentary support on spinning up a mongodb docker container?
2 [2017-04-18T00:33:09] <realisation> I'm trying to figure out how to access the mongo cli from my command line
3 [2017-04-18T02:55:17] <realisation> thebuccaneersden: Thanks!
4 [2017-04-18T02:55:25] <realisation> I'm working with a container that has an entry-point
5 [2017-04-18T02:55:51] <realisation> but/bin/bashwould usually spin up a shell executing inside that particular container ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-18T00:35:17] <thebuccaneersden> you could try going into your container and working with mongo directly from there? ie. typedocker psto see a list of all your containers, find the CONTAINER ID for your mongo container, then executedocker exec -i -t <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bashreplacing<CONTAINER ID>with the actual container id (a hash likecdd536e1fb5f).
2 [2017-04-18T00:35:20] <thebuccaneersden> realisation:
3 [2017-04-18T03:41:04] <thebuccaneersden> Yeh@realisationeven if it container has an entry point you can still do this  to get shell access to your running container and poke around and what not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-18T03:24:36] <andyneff> Whatever yourCMDis gets runs when a docker image is run. Many base images set this to bash so you can poke around in the images by default. When an entrypoint is set, this gets run instead. Depending on the "form" used in the dockerfile, eitherSHELL ENTRYPOINTis execute when a container starts, orSHELL ENTRYPOINT CMDis executed.
2 [2017-04-18T03:26:48] <andyneff> When you usedocker execnone of that matters, and it just executes whatever command you tell it to in a running container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-18T06:49:03] <SISheogorath> alexeydemin: you can't start MySQL using the service file. A docker container is not a VM and only stays alive as long as the first process of the container doesn't exit. If you start MySQL using the service file, it forks into background which exits the initial process and end up in a dead container. Check the official [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] image on docker hub if you want to know how to run MySQL inside a docker container
2 [2017-04-18T16:45:06] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: yea
3 [2017-04-18T22:02:04] <SISheogorath> alexeydemin: did you build themls-mysqliyourself? And if so which repository did you use? (if it's open source)
4 [2017-04-18T22:05:09] <alexeydemin> Yes, that's an exact (I believe so, I mean I did just docker commit for it) copy of the official _/mysql:5.7 container
5 [2017-04-18T22:58:01] <SISheogorath> alexeydemin: you should avoiddocker commit(as a low level docker command) in general because it prevents you  from providing reproduceable images
6 [2017-04-18T23:01:25] <SISheogorath> Use the official mysql or mariadb images. [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-04-19T00:13:10] <alexeydemin> SISheogorath: Ohh cool, it works, I can't believe it didn't work because I committed working container to an image and then tried to launch it from that image.
8 [2017-04-19T00:16:22] <alexeydemin> The same way I have to use official nginx container and separate official php-fpm container, one-container-per-process approach, right?
9 [2017-04-19T08:39:06] <SISheogorath> MariusDiacu_twitter: swarm-mode should be fine. Checkdocker stack deploy
10 [2017-04-19T10:24:09] <SISheogorath> You should redirect the logs to/dev/stdoutand/dev/stderr. The reason is dead simple: this way docker logging mechanisms work and it allows everyone to redirect/read/collect logs by using docker logging drivers ordocker logscommand/API
11 [2017-04-19T12:05:02] <SISheogorath> sandys: check the whole logging docs: [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-04-19T12:05:33] <SISheogorath> it should point out how to log to journald including all settings you want to use :) Details to journald: [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-04-18T22:08:24] <realisation> thebuccaneersden: thanks! - is there a way I can map my local port 12707 to refer to my mongo docker instance ?
2 [2017-04-18T22:20:03] <realisation> actually, I'm only wondering that to know if the thing is working at first
3 [2017-04-18T22:20:41] <realisation> ultimately I'll just have a dockerized mongo DB connected to my dockerized app
4 [2017-04-18T22:20:58] <realisation> it looks like docker compose takes care of that

8 [2017-04-18T22:45:21] <realisation> can you explain the context there, is that port12345on my local host that pipes into port80on the docker container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-18T23:12:05] <buyology> if you launch a container withdocker runand keep it alive, but have say 100s of versions of the same docker. how can I effectively check which docker to dodocker execon?
2 [2017-04-18T23:13:09] <thebuccaneersden> realisation: - “hostport:containerport”
3 [2017-04-18T23:13:44] <buyology> are there any short hands for this or do I first have to list all running containers with e. g.docker psand then if the correct version is running exec on that imageid?

1 [2017-04-18T23:52:21] <SISheogorath> buyology: you can usedocker ps -fto filter your container to get the right id. If you use docker compose you can also dodocker-compose exec composename binaryor if you need an interactive shelldocker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q composename) binary. There are many ways to achieve your target. Stay creative :)
2 [2017-04-18T23:52:51] <SISheogorath> And in general using container names is a good advice ^^

1 [2017-04-19T08:00:54] <MariusDiacu_twitter> Can someone recommend me a Docker based tool for managing a development server with multiple web projects (each project with 3-4 containers)? Something simpler than Openshift. I dont want high scaling with swarm mode, just to be able to run and created multiple instances of projects based on some docker-compose or such kind of config files.

1 [2017-04-19T10:16:33] <sandys> hi guys - anyone know how to configure logging with docker-swarmkit and supervisord running in containers ? confused on whether to share the /var/log directory or redirect to stderr, etc . what are you guys doing ?
2 [2017-04-19T11:31:56] <sandys> SISheogorath: thanks for this - my host is running journald. is there a way to ensure that docker logs go to journald and are tagged with name, container-id, etc ?

1 [2017-04-19T13:59:36] <sniper0110> Hello everyone,I've been working on implementing an API that uses a tensorflow model. I used MLDB (Machine Learning Database) to implement the API. I am completely new to this and I was asked to deploy this API to a remote ubuntu machine that I have access to. I used a docker container for mldb and everything I'm using is inside that container. Is it possible to deploy the container so that someone else can test my API? Is deploying a container the same thing as deploying an API?Thanks in advance.

1 [2017-04-20T07:55:59] <coding-yogi> Hi, In my CI job of building Docker image, I see that COPY command doesn't invalidate the cache despite of files inside the folder being updated
2 [2017-04-20T07:56:10] <coding-yogi> any idea why this should be happening
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-20T14:05:29] <rusbob> Hi,
2 [2017-04-20T14:05:49] <rusbob> Are you sure the content of the files has changed ?
3 [2017-04-20T14:06:15] <rusbob> See reference:COPY - the contents of the file(s) in the image are examined and a checksum is calculated for each file. The last-modified and last-accessed times of the file(s) are not considered in these checksums. During the cache lookup, the checksum is compared against the checksum in the existing images. If anything has changed in the file(s), such as the contents and metadata, then the cache is invalidated.

1 [2017-04-20T19:24:21] <chrisRubiano> hello! im using docker-compose for a django server, and im having trouble with an installed pip package, is there any way to view the files from a docker volume or container? like /usr/local/lib/python...
2 [2017-04-20T19:53:16] <chrisRubiano> SISheogorath: how can i connect to the volume? here's the bit of code from the docker file im using to build [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-20T19:27:49] <SISheogorath> in most cases you can run a normal shell inside your container (with mounted volumes) or you mount those volumes to another container which provides a shell and let you check it out. Or is it a problem comping up during build?
2 [2017-04-20T19:56:37] <SISheogorath> O.o that something you should really not do... You mount the app into the image?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-20T19:47:49] <rusbob> Docker is dead. call it mobyThis is real provocation. Moby has many references to Docker resources and you call it "dead" ? LOL
2 [2017-04-20T19:48:37] <talkimhi11> I meant the docker brand
3 [2017-04-20T19:56:39] <rusbob> talkimhi11: Ok, I've got it. Docker will be spitted into components and Moby will be like a assembler project for multiple docker components.
4 [2017-04-20T19:59:15] <SISheogorath> moby is more or less the Docker framework ^^
5 [2017-04-20T19:59:19] <SISheogorath> that's all
6 [2017-04-20T20:02:42] <rusbob> Looks like Moby will be an oss project and docker will be more like commercial product.
7 [2017-04-20T20:03:14] <rusbob> clever and in-time marketing approach ))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-20T20:16:24] <SISheogorath> Docker stays open source. The point is: they want to allow people to build their own products based on moby without all the branding problem that are cause because everyone says it's build with docker. So split it out allows everyone to talk about containerd and moby while docker itself is more clearly the product of the Docker Inc. like the docker CE or Docker EE. Docker CE is simply the build of tools like swarmkit, moby, etc. so it's a useful collection of tools build to work together. And as Docker CE stays free it's only in parts about commercial. The Docker EE is in parts closed source but it's a bit like Redhat, Fedora and RHEL.
2 [2017-04-21T01:40:27] <SISheogorath> alexeydemin: can't say for sure, never tried. In general, as already mentioned,docker commitis something you should not use as long as you are not about to do really crazy things with docker containers. I would say it's possible that it breaks theCMDand/orENTRYPOINT. In this case the mysql server wouldn't start anymore. If you want to add your database to a container (like prefilling it for deployments) I would suggest you to use a volumes you ship or extent the mysql image.docker commitis a dead way.
3 [2017-04-21T01:46:10] <SISheogorath> Hint: As there is aVOLUMEdefined in the [<-LINK->] you can\'t prefill the data inside the mysql database. You have to fill it by add your sqldump into the init directory that is mentioned in the README on Docker Hub. More details about this "problem" of theVOLUMEkeyword can be found here: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-04-21T01:46:25] <SISheogorath> See the second note
5 [2017-04-21T01:47:16] <alexeydemin> SISheogorath: Cool, thank you for the explanation.
6 [2017-04-21T18:03:57] <SISheogorath> viveleroi: In genereal there is some kind of filesystem like you know it from your normal host system. What docker does is using a layer filesystem which is splitted (depending on your volume driver) into multiple files/blobbs. Those blobbs are read by your kernel in an isolated cgroup and also written like (a bit like a swap file or a vhd). this way you can address the things. All these blobb files ware located in/var/lib/dockerby default. And when you install somethings that's the place where your bits and bytes are located
7 [2017-04-21T18:04:34] <SISheogorath> please notice that's the very, very short version :D I guess we could talk a day about that without the need to search for new topics ^^
8 [2017-04-21T18:23:49] <SISheogorath> it depends on your definition of a virtual machine. In general a virtual machine emulates (virtual) hardware (like a CPU, a graphic card, network interfaces, ...). Docker doesn't do that. Docker provides filesystems with a shared kernel and isolates them (as good as possible)
9 [2017-04-21T18:24:56] <SISheogorath> that's the reason why you can't run a Windows based image on a linux based kernel
10 [2017-04-21T18:26:21] <SISheogorath> And theubuntu,alpine, etc. base images are simply snapshots of a filesystem. So it looks like you're on a ubuntu machine because all tools and configs are in same place as you have them in ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-20T20:25:00] <rusbob> yep, looks like this:Moby is just open source projectDocker CE is free product based on Moby OSS with additional functionality.Docker EE is commercial product based on Docker CE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T01:36:28] <alexeydemin> SISheogorath: Is that true that container created from commited and renamed official mysql image doesn't launch mysql service automatically on container sturtup?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T15:51:33] <chkm8> How could I edit or add extension in php.ini via dockerfile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T15:54:38] <SISheogorath> how would you do it in a shellscript?
2 [2017-04-21T15:55:11] <SISheogorath> sedis your friend :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T17:50:53] <viveleroi> I\'ve been reading intros/guides to docker but there\'s one thing I\'m still not clear on - where does the installed software "go"? As a vagrant user, the VM concept is clear to me. If i install node or nginx or mongo it\'s in the VM and will never touch my host system. I can boot the vm like any other server. I\'m trying to understand how docker handles software installation and execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T18:12:34] <viveleroi> so are virtual machines still involved, just not unique to every container? If I start something I pulled from the hub which runs node, mongodb, is docker still going to download an ubuntu image, boot it, etc (assuming the scripts FROM is based on an ubuntu image)? I'm just trying to make sure I have a clear mental image of this. with a vm, you'd modify the actual vm to start up servers on boot but it sounds like with docker, you need to ensure that's done in your script
2 [2017-04-21T19:19:13] <viveleroi> SISheogorath: I think that makes sense. I'll have to toy around with it and get a better feel for the process. I can see how docker can simplify deployment but I don't see how I can share a dev environment script with someone on another platform. docker mentions that in the sales pitch, but if someone on windows can have a local ubuntu dev server, how would the environments be the same
3 [2017-04-21T19:25:20] <viveleroi> ok, so to "ensure everyone uses ubuntu 16.04" is that possible with the dockerfile or something they\'d have to manually setup?
4 [2017-04-21T19:25:46] <viveleroi> that\'s what we do now with vagrant, but obviously downloading a whole disk image for every "box" is inefficient
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T19:03:17] <ghost202> What is more of the docker convention? one container per project, or all projects in one container? or is it just personal preference?
2 [2017-04-21T19:03:36] <ghost202> project meaning web application
3 [2017-04-21T19:05:37] <SISheogorath> on process per container. And if you have like multiple websites: one container per webpage. Isolate as much as possible into an own image/container
4 [2017-04-21T19:06:24] <SISheogorath> so you maybe end up with multiple container per project
5 [2017-04-21T19:07:15] <ghost202> SISheogorath: okay, thanks
6 [2017-04-21T19:07:17] <SISheogorath> At the end for sure it's personal preference but best practices are very clear. When you check the docker hub you'll find tons and tons of bad designed containers :/ as sad as it is
7 [2017-04-21T19:08:00] <ghost202> Are they changing the project over to "moby"?
8 [2017-04-21T19:09:35] <SISheogorath> moby is part of docker. It's splitted out to make more clear that moby is only one part of the docker engine and to break it up in smaller, more reusable pieces
9 [2017-04-21T19:10:05] <ghost202> i see.
10 [2017-04-21T19:10:37] <SISheogorath> so if you don't develop the docker engine, you can simply ignore it. Docker engine stays docker engine
11 [2017-04-21T19:21:10] <SISheogorath> Docker4Windows as well as Docker4Mac are a special topic. They actually use virtual machines in background to run a minimal linux machine with docker behind the scenes as long as you want to work with linux containers. (Docker also offers windows containers, but I can't say much about them. As I don't use them)
12 [2017-04-21T19:23:53] <SISheogorath> The important thing is: with the Dockerfile you define an environment. You make sure that everyone uses (for example) ubuntu:16.04 as baseimage and all files are always in same place. regardless of the fact that the person actually runs arch, fedora or Windows. the programm will run in a defined environment as ubuntu:16.04 and also uses all libraries and configs that are provided by ubuntu:16.04 and not the ones they use on their normal system
13 [2017-04-21T19:25:06] <SISheogorath> that makes the whole development easier as you don't have to figure out anymore where they have placed this stupid library X on this system. Also it allows you to use a specific version of a library or binary without a fear of conflicts if you have another base system
14 [2017-04-21T19:26:01] <SISheogorath> simply placeFROM ubuntu:16.04in your dockerfile (at the top) and instantly everything inside the container is working like in ubuntu
15 [2017-04-21T19:27:18] <viveleroi> ok cool, thanks
16 [2017-04-21T19:27:49] <viveleroi> so if they wind up having 4 different containers/dockerfile projects, they really only download that base image once?
17 [2017-04-21T19:28:15] <SISheogorath> The point is vagrant uses more ressources than docker as you always have a full VM running. and also "testing if the whole application works on python 3 as well as on python 2" is easier with Docker ^^ simply changeFROM python:2toFROM python:3and rundocker build .again and see if it works ^^
18 [2017-04-21T19:28:43] <SISheogorath> if all those containers are based on the same base image, yes
19 [2017-04-21T19:29:10] <viveleroi> ok, I think I have a clear picture now. thanks
20 [2017-04-21T19:29:16] <SISheogorath> same base image means something likepython:3. Another base image is:python:2
21 [2017-04-21T19:29:26] <SISheogorath> but also applies to ubuntu and debian and alpine
22 [2017-04-21T19:29:38] <SISheogorath> in fact python is based on debian for example
23 [2017-04-21T19:30:03] <SISheogorath> so if you already have debian base image on your machine it'll only download the diff to the python image
24 [2017-04-21T19:30:39] <viveleroi> so FROM python:* refers to what kind of image?
25 [2017-04-21T19:31:44] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] <-- this (if no other registry  is specified and there is no image with this name and version, docker hub is used as default)
26 [2017-04-21T19:32:04] <SISheogorath> if you want to look deeper: [<-LINK->]
27 [2017-04-21T19:32:14] <SISheogorath> that's a nice visualisation of the layers ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-21T19:35:02] <viveleroi> ok so if I used that, somewhere upstream docker would download/use a debian image? FROM: ubuntu makes sense since that's an OS but I wasn't sure how FROM: python:* dictated which OS/image it was used against
2 [2017-04-21T19:36:56] <viveleroi> I guessFROMwould only allow a single base? so if I wanted python, but also mysql and a few more tools, I\'d sayFROM ubuntu:something"and then include the theaptcommands to install the tools
3 [2017-04-21T19:37:45] <SISheogorath> in general you should only place one application per container/image
4 [2017-04-21T19:38:17] <SISheogorath> and use for example and own mysql container for mysql
5 [2017-04-21T19:39:00] <SISheogorath> the best practices talks about: one process per container. Which is not always possible but a good advice.
6 [2017-04-21T19:40:38] <viveleroi> ok, new avenue for me to look into I guess, since I'm not clear what you mean. if I have a node server application, it would need node, postgres, maybe redis. those all need to be running for my app to work, and with vagrant those would all go in the same VM, but you're saying with docker they should, ideally, be run separately with different docker files/images?
7 [2017-04-21T19:41:42] <SISheogorath> yes. you would have 3 container. one for node, one for redis and one for postgres. That's why docker-compose exists. See for example the wordpress tutorial: [<-LINK->]
8 [2017-04-21T19:42:14] <SISheogorath> or django: [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-04-21T19:42:42] <SISheogorath> Or if you like it a bit more interactive: [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-04-21T19:42:51] <viveleroi> cool thanks, I'll look at those
11 [2017-04-21T23:48:45] <SISheogorath> Do you actually use docker-machine?
12 [2017-04-22T09:24:51] <SISheogorath> alexw10: if you usedocker runordocker servicethere is the parameter-eyou can use-e VARIABLENAME=$VARIABLEor if you use docker-compose you can use the same way in theenvironment:section of you service

1 [2017-04-24T10:02:51] <SISheogorath> Datadogs does a great job for monitoring docker. They have a free plan for 5 or 10 hosts (Without alerts).
2 [2017-04-24T10:08:39] <SISheogorath> For a on prem solutions I would suggest Prometheus
3 [2017-04-24T17:09:16] <SISheogorath> wcgcoder: possibly related to: [<-ISSUE->]
4 [2017-04-24T17:38:24] <SISheogorath> In general I can say I noticed a similar behavior related tonet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6
5 [2017-04-24T17:38:51] <SISheogorath> fixed it with a few scripts and a systemd.timer :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T14:11:44] <thebuccaneersden> MKiselev: I dont have any examples, but setting up munin is simple. All the docker containers you want to monitor should have the munin client installed. And then you have 1 docker container with the munin server which is configured with the nodes it should monitor. ie. like with this ~> [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-04-24T16:29:30] <wcgcoder> So... Monday problems... trying to track down why whenever I restart docker, all ipv6 addresses are removed from my NICs
2 [2017-04-24T16:30:23] <wcgcoder> When I reload sysctl, I getnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 0, but when I restart docker and check again, it's set asnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
3 [2017-04-24T16:30:38] <wcgcoder> Not seeing anything obvious in my system logs
4 [2017-04-24T16:34:55] <wcgcoder> Looks like setting--ipv6breaks docker. Need to specify my own CIDR. Annoying
5 [2017-04-24T16:47:56] <wcgcoder> Even after adding--fixed-cidr-v6 2001:db8:1::/64to the daemon in systemd, docker still seems to be wiping out my ipv6 addresses
6 [2017-04-24T18:15:56] <wcgcoder>  [<-CODE->] That sounds awful
7 [2017-04-24T18:16:39] <wcgcoder> SISheogorath: looks related, you're right
8 [2017-04-24T18:17:36] <wcgcoder> SISheogorath: Nice, looks like a fix is coming down the pipe for 17.05
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T18:03:17] <Trezamere> is there a good solution to managing volume permissions on a host mounted filesystem yet?  I think the two best options are to have an entrypoint script to gosu as the user or to pass the /etc/passwd and /etc/group as ro and pass the --user UID:GID; both have drawbacks
2 [2017-04-24T18:03:23] <Trezamere> something like a volume plugin?
3 [2017-04-24T18:06:23] <SISheogorath> Trezamere: check the [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-04-24T18:06:49] <SISheogorath> I would suggest you to use direct-lvm if you run on a single host or hosts with vhds
5 [2017-04-24T18:17:38] <SISheogorath> wcgcoder: do you use any container withnetwork_mode: hostor--net host?
6 [2017-04-24T18:17:44] <SISheogorath> I know
7 [2017-04-24T18:18:09] <SISheogorath> If you do than the bug is related to this container :D
8 [2017-04-24T18:22:56] <Trezamere> SISheogorath: interesting read but I don't see how using devicemapper solves the problem of writing everything as root back to the host system?
9 [2017-04-24T18:25:11] <SISheogorath> Trezamere: in case you use a volume driver and named docker volumes you don't run in that issue. You only run into it while using the bind driver and mount existing directories and mounts inside your container.
10 [2017-04-24T18:26:50] <SISheogorath> the common solution is to do, like you said, a chown and then su-exec or gosu but I don't like that solution. Using docker volumes is the better way to go
11 [2017-04-24T18:27:18] <wcgcoder> SISheogorath: docker inspect -f "{{.HostConfig.NetworkMode}}" rancher-agent=> host
12 [2017-04-24T18:27:52] <wcgcoder> SISheogorath: (i.e. yes).
13 [2017-04-24T18:28:32] <SISheogorath> wcgcoder: oh.. Rancher... :/ sounds like a lot of fun for your environment with this bug :D
14 [2017-04-24T18:28:57] <wcgcoder> SISheogorath: I love Rancher, there are just a few gotchas
15 [2017-04-24T18:29:50] <SISheogorath> Oh yes, Rancher is nice :D but since you have to run their agent everywhere and it runs on host network it's not really nice to use with this bug :D
16 [2017-04-24T18:30:18] <wcgcoder> Yeah... I'm experience some weird issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T18:30:31] <Trezamere> Is there an intuitive way to pull files out of a docker volume?  e.g. for a build server, or running local builds?  we use docker to provide a build environment and so we need to write and move things on the host system
2 [2017-04-24T18:30:49] <Trezamere> I know volumes are in general preferred for containers but it seems like maybe this is an edge case or maybe I'm unaware
3 [2017-04-24T19:11:05] <Trezamere> Yes but the data container will still be writing files as root; just as if I use a named volume it's writing things into /var/lib/docker/ which is also owned by root so I still have the problem of writing things as root.  I already know the suggested workarounds that I mentioned above I was asking if there was a better way to handle it or if that's still the best we got
4 [2017-04-24T19:27:53] <SISheogorath> Trezamere: writing outside of a docker container as root is not a problem ._.
5 [2017-04-24T19:28:15] <SISheogorath> That's completely normal for docker
6 [2017-04-24T19:43:16] <Trezamere> I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not; but there is an entire market dedicated to securing docker and running least privilege containers.  Which is besides the point as I am specifically asking to write files out as specific users so, yes, it is a problem
7 [2017-04-24T19:44:02] <Trezamere> dragon788: I'm not really following you :( are you suggesting I create a data container as the user in question and volume map it to the other container?  I'm pretty sure the files will still be written into that volume with the UID of whoever is doing teh writing
8 [2017-04-24T19:52:10] <Trezamere> reiterating the question as there seems to be something lost in translation; basically is it possible to mount a volume with specific ownership; either natively or via a plugin, so I could do something like-v /dir:/dir:rw:$(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER), I know you can create custom entrypoint scripts and share the same base image to do similar things or pass /etc/passwd and group and use--user, however both have limitations
9 [2017-04-24T19:54:41] <Trezamere> user-namespaces has to many restrictions
10 [2017-04-24T20:03:50] <SISheogorath> Trezamere: I guess you should refer to this: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T19:00:52] <dragon788> Trezamere: what kind of files are you wanting to pull out of the volume?
2 [2017-04-24T19:02:15] <dragon788> if you have say a "data volume" in docker speak that lives in a data container, you could map in additional volumes from the host eg$host/builds/logsand map that onto$buildcontainer/datavolume/builds/logsand instead of writing those logs into the container they would drop back out to the host
3 [2017-04-24T19:03:00] <dragon788> it's very similar to having multiple bind mounts in Linux where you can override specific subpaths to go to different volumes or directories if they grow large or need different speeds of disk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T19:17:25] <dragon788> have you looked at the differences between named volumes and data containers? I'm not sure if they fixed the permissions or if it allows overriding the user for the named volume on creation but I thought I saw something to that effect recently
2 [2017-04-24T20:04:49] <dragon788> could always try the s6-overlay that works around this as well, [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-04-25T19:29:49] <dragon788> Hasnayeen: see the previous answer with -v or read the docs linked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T20:26:26] <vladimnir> i don't see the benefit of using docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T21:01:10] <thebuccaneersden> whats confusing you@vladimnir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-24T21:37:26] <SISheogorath> vladimnir: that's possible. There are cases where you can't benefit from docker. Mostly that are cases where you work a lot with kernel internals or low level communication. Also the benefit of docker is limit for regular desktop users. So as@thebuccaneersdenhas pointed out, if you describe your possible use-case for docker a bit more detailed, we can clear things up :)
2 [2017-04-25T08:59:59] <SISheogorath> I agree that submodules aren't the perfect solution. The best practices in your case mainly depend on your way to build your application. In most cases you simply use something like i18n support, which would solve the problem without running into this problem.
3 [2017-04-25T09:02:02] <SISheogorath> As a general rule of thumb: if you have the same base with multiple versions create a base image and create variations. (As you said yourself) for development/testing/production config you should use environment variables to generate those configs
4 [2017-04-25T09:03:28] <SISheogorath> That makes it better maintainable and allow to ship the same image you used to test and verified to work fine in your CI process as well as in production
5 [2017-04-25T09:04:00] <SISheogorath> So your CI/CD process becomes reliable
6 [2017-04-25T09:31:21] <SISheogorath> You should avoid volumes-from if you run docker swarm because it is a local thing and not really compatible.
7 [2017-04-25T14:43:11] <SISheogorath> finspin: docker has very simply logic here: If the first process of the command (the one you call byCMD,ENTRYPOINT,entrypoint:orcommand:) exits, the whole container dies. So what ever you want to do inside the container, make sure it won't exit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-25T07:54:24] <Scapal> Hi, what is the best practice to aggregate content from multiple sources (each being a git repo) with differente release cycles: base website, translations, dev/prod configurations... ?Should I create a with_translation container using 'FROM base_website' ... or have an independent container for the translations and use a volume_from?
2 [2017-04-25T08:38:49] <Scapal> git submodulesdoesn't allow me to compose different configurations. Also I don't like submodules since here the submodule will change more often than the main content. Submodules are linked to a particular commit if I remember correctly.Having the build process for the translation separated from the main website is also a +.I will also have to add bundled Angular apps to the main website and I prefer to keep that build process isolated as well.
3 [2017-04-25T09:15:53] <Scapal> What about using volume-from? Is it a no-no?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-25T08:19:07] <themue> Scapal: git add submodule
2 [2017-04-25T08:20:52] <SISheogorath> git submodule addif you want to use ithides
3 [2017-04-25T08:21:36] <themue> Hehe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-25T09:31:34] <themue> Another way could be vendoring by cloning the different repos into the main one. But may need some automation to checkout the correct branches or tags.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-25T14:28:58] <finspin> In my docker-compose.yml I runcommand: bash -c "npm install && tail -f /dev/null". I need to do tail -f to keep the container up and running. Is there some other, cleaner way? I tried couple of things like tty: true and stdin_open: true but container always stops unless I pass tail -f to the command.
2 [2017-04-25T14:56:51] <finspin> SISheogorath: got it, thanks

1 [2017-04-25T22:42:05] <FuzzOli87> Did version 3 of Docker compose change the way it handles volumes? I have/home/app/node_modulesas a volume which used to create a node_modules with all the packages, now it just leaves it empty

1 [2017-04-26T12:06:12] <timilsinabishal> How can I access the host port from the container?
2 [2017-04-26T12:23:09] <timilsinabishal> SISheogorath: thanks for your swift and detailed answer. I will look into network_mode: host to see if it solves my problem.
3 [2017-04-26T12:24:41] <timilsinabishal> mostafa: thanks for your reply. But that is not the problem I am facing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-26T12:19:32] <SISheogorath> timilsinabishal: the current "mostly used" way is to simply access it like your host is a remote computer. (means use it\'s public hostname) and then go the regular way. If you try to connect some kind of loopback TCP port: No, not possible as long as you don\'t use--net hostornetwork_mode: host. Problem with those modes is they break the network isolation of your container and also possibly cause trouble related to IPv6 since there was a bug in libnetwork
2 [2017-04-26T12:20:50] <mostafa> timilsinabishal: you should expose it
3 [2017-04-26T12:21:24] <mostafa> timilsinabishal:  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-04-27T11:11:05] <mostafa> damilare:  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-04-27T11:55:05] <SISheogorath> If you use-v localpath:containerpaththen all changes made by the container are also applied to the local directory. To be clear: these are normal mount points. So if you know those kernel concepts it's nothing magical :)
6 [2017-04-27T11:56:57] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: officiallydowngrades are not supported. i would suggest to clean up the setup by removing docker completely and reinstall 1.12.x
7 [2017-04-27T11:58:17] <SISheogorath> Make sure you also kill/var/lib/docker. Note that this will delete all containers and named volumes (if you used the default volume driver)
8 [2017-04-27T12:02:52] <SISheogorath> papaiatis: checkout jwilder's nginx reverse proxy project if you really want it to be nginx you use as reverse proxy. Otherwise I suggest Traefik. You can serve your webpages by extending the nginx image and don't need to expose any port for your nginx containers. Simply put them together with jwilder's nginx or Traefik in a compose file and do the needed configs in there. Docker compose creates a network for the project and puts all services in there. Services on the same network don't need to expose ports to access each other so Traefik other the nginx proxy can simply connect to both webpages using port 80
9 [2017-04-27T15:40:21] <SISheogorath> 4406arthur: Just a question out of interest? What Monitoring do you use? (if you use one)

1 [2017-04-27T11:34:44] <papaiatis> Hi Guys! I\'d like to achieve the following:create two containers, that hosts (using nginx) two different websites. Container A will expose port 5000, Container B will expose port 5100 but not accessible from outside\ncreate a third container where nginx will run and expose port 443 to the bridge network, so that it is accessible from outside\nconfigure nginx in a way that it behaves like a proxy: it forwards incoming traffic to either Container A or Container BQuestion is: how should I configure these containers so that the nginx container can access the other containers on the 5000 and 5100 ports?What I believe is that I need to create a "user-defined network" so that these three containers can access each other using container name .

1 [2017-04-27T11:47:39] <lukewatts> Hi all, I'm on my 3rd day of learning Docker. Going well. I'm just wondering about volumes. When something is changes or generated inside a running container is that reflected on the host? Or is just from host to container changes are reflected?
2 [2017-04-27T11:55:56] <lukewatts> chadlyon: @SISheogorathPerfect! Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T12:15:01] <damilare> chadlyon: so the picture is there is a process running in a container already, a web app process. if I put a pdb statement in a line, and I hit the URL, I want to be able to drop into a shell to introspect the data

1 [2017-04-27T13:03:18] <lukewatts> I have a volume related question. I created a Node app and I run the container withdocker run -tid -p 80:80 -v ~/html:/usr/share/nginx/html --name nodeapp1 nodeapp:1.0. I log in upload images etc and then when I check~/htmlon my host nothing is saved. But the changes persist when I stop and start the container. I've checkdocker volume lsand I have no named volumes. Where the hell are those changes being stored?
2 [2017-04-27T13:08:50] <lukewatts> Anddocker inspect nodeapp1shows that Mounts has the correct values I expect."Source": "/home/ubuntu/html", "Destination": "/usr/share/nginx/html"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T13:43:07] <chadlyon> damilare: without more specifics I still can't really get an idea of exactly what you are trying to do but play around with my second comment to you above. That will get you a debug shell inside your docker container. That will give you a good start. Alternatively, running a regular interactive shell like bash in your container would be:

1 [2017-04-27T17:08:05] <FuzzOli87> SISheogorath: Sorry this is a late response. But in reference to my node_modules volume on my host machine being empty, I set it up like this:
2 [2017-04-27T17:08:10] <FuzzOli87>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-04-27T17:09:02] <FuzzOli87> So now it creates the node_modules directory on my house, but it's empty. I am using yarn to do my installs, not sure if that matters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T17:21:22] <SISheogorath> FuzzOli87: you create a separate, unnamed volume for your node_modules. It's normal that this wouldn't be visible to your host.  The content of node_modules is a mountpoint in you container so you can't see it outside
2 [2017-04-27T17:22:00] <FuzzOli87> SISheogorath: But this worked in the past, did something chang?
3 [2017-04-27T17:39:59] <SISheogorath> FuzzOli87: no, nothing changed in perspective of mountpoint handling. If you remove the first entry in yourvolume:section the node modules will be installed to the host directory as you expect
4 [2017-04-27T17:41:28] <SISheogorath> vito-c: I can only refer to the docker community slack. The title of gitter says it's for development but to be honest since I'm here I saw maybe two small conversations about development and iirc in all of them you were the person who asked :D
5 [2017-04-27T17:42:02] <SISheogorath> Maybe the freenode channel is another option :D
6 [2017-04-27T17:42:06] <FuzzOli87> SISheogorath: You're right. Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T17:42:17] <vito-c> how do i get on the docker slack chat?
2 [2017-04-27T17:42:17] <SISheogorath> You're welcome@FuzzOli87
3 [2017-04-27T17:42:46] <SISheogorath> vito-c: -> [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-04-27T17:43:01] <SISheogorath> Or try the docker forum if you prefer
5 [2017-04-27T17:44:12] <SISheogorath> In general I read something about a mailingliste that is possibly found for moby which then would be the place for development :D
6 [2017-04-27T17:46:03] <vito-c> don't ask to ask just ask!
7 [2017-04-27T17:46:04] <vito-c> :D
8 [2017-04-27T17:46:12] <SISheogorath> The easiest way to find help is to ask the question instead of asking for asking ;)
9 [2017-04-27T17:47:18] <vito-c> but what if i'm not sure if I can ask my question? should I ask if it's ok to ask if I can ask my question?
10 [2017-04-27T17:47:22] <SISheogorath> vito-c: -> [<-LINK->] The best description how to get answers :D
11 [2017-04-27T17:48:25] <vito-c> post your question to a forum where it's off topic
12 [2017-04-27T17:48:27] <vito-c> lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T17:52:11] <ripper2hl> My problem is how run google-chrome in docker container for e2e testing , i make an Dockerfile from official jenkins image, but when try run google-chrome this crash and show the next error [<-CODE->] the jenkins docker image use debian jessie. [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-04-27T17:52:35] <ripper2hl> this is my docker file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T18:08:09] <SISheogorath> ripper2hl: can you run it with the--no-sandboxflag and check if the problem persist?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T18:16:00] <SISheogorath> oh sounds wonderful :D at least you get another error message. Your problem is based in the very strict isolation rules for docker containers. The problem is that chrome and chromium do tons of low-level isolation things with the kernel. Docker in permit them by default. That's why Jessie wrote an own ruleset. sounds like a lot of work to do to run it really headless in docker :/
2 [2017-04-27T18:17:20] <SISheogorath> Maybe check their image: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-04-27T18:17:32] <SISheogorath> and replace the base image with the jenkins one
4 [2017-04-27T18:17:51] <SISheogorath> that's also an option
5 [2017-04-27T18:18:02] <ripper2hl> okay very nice aproach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T21:49:47] <KramKroc> Hi folks. Moving from docker-compose 2 to docker-compose 3. We previously had a log aggregator container which defined the host location to write all our container logs to. The other containers used volumes_from to pull that together. With volumes_from being dropped in version 3, I wondered what the best advice was to achieve the same end result. e.g. [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-04-27T21:53:51] <KramKroc> I thought this would allow me to define the volume externally, so that e.g. I could have logsMarks set up for dev and another volume definition for cloud etc. So example for dev/local would be: [<-CODE->] But when I run the docker-compose up command, it doesn’t make use of the logsMark volume, but instead uses one that appears to be based on the folder the compose file is based, e.g. fragglerock_logsMark.
3 [2017-04-27T21:54:38] <KramKroc> So what am I doing wrong here, why is my definition not be aligned to the named one in the docker-compose definition?
4 [2017-04-28T07:12:57] <KramKroc>  I’ll give that a go@SISheogoraththanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-27T23:58:40] <SISheogorath> KramKroc: docker compose always prefixes a project name. By default it's the name of the folder you started docker-compose in.
2 [2017-04-28T00:00:21] <SISheogorath> if you want to use the volume you created in a separated step, useexternal: truein your compose file. [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-04-28T10:33:38] <SISheogorath> KramKroc:  [<-LINK->] ?
4 [2017-04-28T15:03:01] <AnthonyWC> hlogeon: you can use the verbose flag
5 [2017-04-29T11:28:52] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: apt-get install npmshould fix the problem
6 [2017-04-29T11:41:14] <SISheogorath> ael-g: the official docs says/suggestion is to use a separated container and tar/untar your data to the data volume or use shared data volumes by adding a volume driver which talks to an external API.
7 [2017-04-29T12:17:12] <SISheogorath> Sounds like a permission problem .-. it tries to install the angular CLI to a place that doesn't exist. Maybe checkout this example I build for angular CLI based applications: [<-ISSUE->]
8 [2017-04-29T12:19:15] <SISheogorath> You can fix your original error by runningmkdir /@angular-clibut I would suggest you to not do it because it feels like there is an environment variable missing
9 [2017-04-29T12:23:23] <yuvgeek> SISheogorath: yeah, that for my app
10 [2017-04-29T12:23:32] <yuvgeek> that uses nginx
11 [2017-04-29T12:25:30] <SISheogorath> Wow I can't help myself I always mix you up xD
12 [2017-04-29T12:31:21] <SISheogorath> That's totally not what the error message said
13 [2017-04-29T12:31:58] <yuvgeek> Ahh leave that.
14 [2017-04-29T12:32:11] <yuvgeek> Now I couldn't install angular cli
15 [2017-04-30T21:13:05] <SISheogorath> RStrydom: I wouldn\'t recommend you to use that image. The official docker best practices say "One process per container" which is not always possible but should endup in "one function per container" so a lamp-Stack would endup in 2 or 3 containers.
16 [2017-04-30T21:15:01] <SISheogorath> checkout [<-LINK->] if you want to have some very detailed guides
17 [2017-04-30T21:16:10] <thebuccaneersden> no worries. as you said, this is all new to you
18 [2017-04-30T21:17:00] <thebuccaneersden> i’d probably take the approach of using docker-compose to split up the different things into different containers: ie. one for mariadb, one for php-fpm, one for nginx, etc
19 [2017-04-30T21:17:11] <thebuccaneersden> its pretty simple to do once you play with it a little
20 [2017-04-30T21:56:30] <SISheogorath> Mhm maybe I should go back to the old time and stop writing https:// in front of links :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-28T10:11:55] <KramKroc> Does anyone have a steer on what the best practice for volumes and compose files is? In particular if you may have different volume needs depending on whether you are in dev, on prem or in cloud?

1 [2017-04-30T02:18:49] <thebuccaneersden> never heard of it, but somewhat concerned about using something that is a wrapper to docker breaking further down the line line vagrant and virtual box occassionally break api compatibility
2 [2017-04-30T21:12:30] <thebuccaneersden> RStrydom: You have to link the container volume to a local path on the host when you spin up the container. Specifically with something like this:-v /my/data/directory:/var/www/htmlin the arguments
3 [2017-04-30T21:13:03] <thebuccaneersden> from [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-04-30T21:13:28] <thebuccaneersden> this is true
5 [2017-04-30T21:13:44] <thebuccaneersden> there does seem to be a lot of installed packages in this container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-04-30T20:54:48] <RStrydom> Hay guys, docker newbie question, I am busy setting up a lamp server on AWS and wanted to tryout docker, I used the docker pull command and have the container up and running, but with the image I have chosen they say they have mapped 4 volumes which I need access to but not sure how. 1. Do I need to setup the mapping to my own filesystem via cmd or the dockerfile? 2. If I used the pull method, where does the dockerfile get stored?I'm using this image https://hub.docker.com/r/fauria/lamp/Thanks for your time :)
2 [2017-04-30T21:15:31] <RStrydom> thebuccaneersden: Thank you I saw those lines in the docs, but I was concerned since they were already mapped
3 [2017-04-30T21:19:24] <RStrydom> SISheogorath: Thanks man, I see what you are saying about the single responsibility issues of that image. I will go through that guide as well, thanks, have done tutorials in the past but I was just unsure about this one aspect where I had no dockerfile to play around with.
4 [2017-04-30T21:19:50] <RStrydom> thebuccaneersden: Thanks man, will check it out
5 [2017-04-30T21:22:28] <RStrydom> checkout https://training.play-with-docker.com if you want to have some very detailed guides
6 [2017-04-30T21:22:57] <RStrydom> Just thought I'd let you know that the SSL certificate is currently not working, so just got a bit of a scare on the https link
7 [2017-04-30T21:23:20] <thebuccaneersden> just noticed that as well
8 [2017-04-30T21:23:30] <thebuccaneersden> tsk tsk… [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-05-01T11:08:57] <Asiddiki> thebuccaneersden: how can i use "--net host" in docker-compose.yml v3 ?..I am using docker stack deploy command to up the service.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-01T16:20:05] <SISheogorath> @Asiddiki the only way to set the networkmode to host is this setting: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#networkmodeBut as the documentation says: It's ignored during stack deploy. You can't use networkmode host in swarm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-01T16:45:16] <RStrydom> SISheogorath: Hay, so yesterday I started going through the training.play link you sent, although on the first tutorial I am going through usingdocker container, but on my AWS Amazon Linux AMI, I cannot usedocker container, I googled it and looked at the help pages and could see that thedocker containersubcommand is under amanagment commandssection , but I could not seem to get a way to get those commands, I searched yum for another possible package, can you kindly let me know what I am missing here?
2 [2017-05-01T16:52:57] <RStrydom> SISheogorath: Ah I see, thanks again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-01T16:48:45] <SISheogorath> These commands are new to docker 1.13 (iirc it was 1.13) and are the first step to "clean up" the docker CLI.  If you use centos or similar you possibly stuck with version 1.12.6 which doesn\'t include these "clean ups". For those versions you should be able to use these commands withoutcontainerin front
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-01T20:50:41] <djmrr> Hey there, I have been a little stuck on the correct docker networking configuration.I'm working inside a couple Centos 7 VM's, in order to have a working proof on concept on a monitoring system with Prometheus & Grafana for our apis/apps/dbs. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Any input would be rad!  Thanks :] !
2 [2017-05-01T20:51:44] <SISheogorath> hint: it's--networknot-network
3 [2017-05-01T20:53:45] <djmrr> SISheogorath: hahah yeah, good catch, I didn\'t copy and paste my command, manually typed it.  I do however use the--network="blah":)
4 [2017-05-01T20:54:22] <SISheogorath> okay :) next step: do you run mysql in it's own container or is it running in docker?
5 [2017-05-01T20:56:08] <djmrr> SISheogorath: I don't run mysql in it's own container, it just runs locally on the machine.  I noticed that that's totally a thing that folks configure, running mysql in it's own container which I think is pretty rad, but our current environment that might be not the best shift.  I'd like to dig into learning more about that nonetheless.
6 [2017-05-01T20:57:55] <SISheogorath> In this case the next step should be to check that it's really listening on127.0.0.1:3306->netstat -ln | grep :3306should show it to us
7 [2017-05-01T20:59:17] <djmrr> SISheogorath: rad, yeah, using netstat to discover open ports, checking for the mysql port yields me this: [<-CODE->]
8 [2017-05-01T20:59:46] <SISheogorath> can you telnet to it?
9 [2017-05-01T21:02:44] <djmrr>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
10 [2017-05-01T21:02:59] <SISheogorath> ouch
11 [2017-05-01T21:03:36] <SISheogorath> wait what other vm?
12 [2017-05-01T21:03:48] <SISheogorath> can you try on the same host?
13 [2017-05-01T21:06:44] <djmrr> @SISheogorath  I have two VM's running centos 7 right now.  One runs the grafana image, prometheus node exporter image, and prometheus server. [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-05-01T21:07:18] <SISheogorath> chech the routing between the vms :D
15 [2017-05-01T21:09:57] <djmrr> SISheogorath: - thanks :) - yeah I'll dig into that then... do you feel that if I can telnet on local host into those ports there might be something that is preventing the convo and that's the problem?  I do have SELinux disabled and no iptables live and running.  Any suggestions maybe where to start digging?  Again, thanks a ton for your help
16 [2017-05-01T21:12:40] <SISheogorath> ip r sshould show first results (orrouteif you prefer oldschool)
17 [2017-05-01T21:14:12] <djmrr> SISheogorath: oh okay, yeah that yields me this: [<-CODE->]
18 [2017-05-01T21:14:40] <SISheogorath> what network is your other vm in?
19 [2017-05-01T21:15:57] <djmrr> SISheogorath: oh yeah, lemme check, running "ip r s" on the other vm yields me this: [<-CODE->]
20 [2017-05-01T21:18:37] <SISheogorath> .-. now things become complicated
21 [2017-05-01T21:23:04] <SISheogorath> what kind of VM are we talking about? a small virtualbox-like or something that runs in vSphere or xen?
22 [2017-05-01T21:35:04] <djmrr> SISheogorath: do you think it could be something to do with the fact I\'m not running mysql in a container?Perhaps, something about using--network="bridge"is working but the local network is what I need to connect to for the mysql server?  When I do use--network="bridge"I can absolutely telnet to it via9104I don\'t think I can telnet to it via3306- again thanks a ton :)
23 [2017-05-01T21:37:23] <SISheogorath> I would say the general error is somewhere else. If you can't connect between VMs you have another problem than something in docker. Once that is fixed, running the mysql node exporter image on your mysql host with--network=hostshouldn't be a problem
24 [2017-05-01T21:40:03] <djmrr> SISheogorath: yeah, I'll have to dig a bit more, running it via bridge absolutely allows me to connect to 9104 but not 3306 from another vm... running it on network via host absolutely does not.... Thanks again for all the help, I'll try to uncover what's causing the communication hiccup.  :)
25 [2017-05-01T21:41:13] <SISheogorath> yes, check the virtual box settings :D Or simply test it on DO instead of in virtual box, that should also avoid that error ^^ (I love public IPs :D)

2 [2017-05-01T21:28:46] <djmrr> SISheogorath: oh, maybe you mean the specs of the vm?The one that I'm working with prom/mysqld-exporter image has 512 MB Memory, 8 GB Virtual Storage\nThe one that runs the main version of prom/prometheus image + prom/node-exporter image + grafana/grafana image has 3072 MB Memory, 20 GB Virtual storage
3 [2017-05-01T21:28:59] <SISheogorath> has it ever worked to connect between the VMs? If not I suggest to follow: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-05-01T21:29:29] <SISheogorath> it was okay. I guess it's a hypervisor problem which permits communication between the VMs

I have windows7 with boot2docker running in a Virtualbox image.My container runs on [<-LINK->] I want to use for example [<-LINK->] Where should I configure the subdomain? In the Linux of Boot2docker, inside my Docker Container (which is also a Linux) or in VirtualBox itself or in all three places ?

1 [2017-05-03T13:13:20] <zpydee> hi all. i'm trying to configure docker hub to tag automated builds using my git tag from travis. can anyone help?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-03T13:47:33] <richardsondx> I have an issue where I have the EXACT same docker container deployed on two different machine. One one machine I’m getting a Connection reset by peer (errno:EcONRESET) when I’m running a script that makes a simple https request… On the other I’m getting a 200 OK response. The same. request works with no problem when I run it on the same machine; but the net/http request is failing on one maachine but not the other.  Here a gist with more info [<-LINK->] If the problem is not the environment (nor the docker version or the virtual machine version), could it be the network? And what docker settings could differ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-03T14:40:12] <MannikJ> Hi! Is it access to connect a container network created by docker compose via it's network name and host name? I can access the container by getting it's ip fromdocker network inspectbut not via it's hostname
2 [2017-05-03T16:04:33] <MannikJ> Well, a network connection ;) For example I can access elasticsearch's http api (which is one of the containers specified in compose file) by writinghttp://<ip_from_inspect>:9200. Why can't I access it by it's service name likehttp://elasticsearch:9200or maybe something likehttp://projectname_default.elasticsearch_1:9200
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-03T14:58:42] <SISheogorath> zpydee: you can configure automated builds to run only on tagged references and use the git tag as tag name. Simply check the automated builds page and select "Tag" instead of "branch" and add some kind of schema you want them to follow
2 [2017-05-03T15:44:21] <SISheogorath> MannikJ: what kind of connection are you thinking about?
3 [2017-05-03T16:15:41] <SISheogorath> this is caused by the fact that docker uses an internal DNS service. if you need to access those things you have two options: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]

1 [2017-05-04T05:55:37] <Asiddiki> Hey Guys can you please tell me how to configure docker registry on https with certificate directory not with certificate name ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T09:16:49] <roolo> Hi, in our team We have some difficulties with mapping host user <-> container user (host user does not own it's files after running container). Could You please point to some nice article or documentation? It seems to me, there is no such mapping in docker, which seems a bit weird to me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T11:45:27] <sushant91265_twitter> hi guys, within docker container I'm able to connect to the npm registry but not able to connect to the private artifactory. I'm just trying npm install. Error I get is npm ERR! network connect ETIMEDOUT 192.17.132.113:8081 >> any idea how to solve this error ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T13:28:29] <pjetr> Hi guys, I am quite new to docker and I have some design questions.Our application consists of 5 sub applications, 2 require PHP, mariadb and redis. The other 3 ar simple JS-applications (and we will need an extra node - redis - mongo stack in the near future). For now we will use docker purely as development environment, but in the near future I would like to modify our CI to use docker. And in the somewhat more distant future I would like our staging and production to also migrate towards docker.But for now, it's purely as a development-environment, moving away from vagrant.My design question is, how would an ideal stack look? Would you do an nginx container for each application, or a single nginx, mariadb, redis, php-fpm for the entire stack? Or would you create a container per app, each containing nginx + whatever?
2 [2017-05-04T14:02:13] <pjetr> I have written an expanded version of my question on stack overflow: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-05-04T14:03:45] <pjetr> hatrena: interesting, so a base-container with only nginx, a php-container which inherits from the nginx-container, and adds databases / caching /  …
4 [2017-05-04T14:09:28] <pjetr> wouldn't that pose problems towards scalability in the future, when we move our production onto docker?
5 [2017-05-04T14:11:40] <hatrena> it depends on how you will manage the containers and linkage between them.  and you need to be careful about the dependency between technolgies if exist.
6 [2017-05-04T14:29:37] <pjetr> so it would be 1 container per app as you are suggesting, thanks
7 [2017-05-04T14:38:03] <pjetr> Another question, compiling the applications, would you perform this in your container, or on your host? (ie.npm run build)
8 [2017-05-04T14:49:31] <hatrena> on container, since what i want is a ready application after running docker-compose up for example
9 [2017-05-04T14:49:39] <hatrena> or applications
10 [2017-05-05T07:13:14] <pjetr> MaximZavitaev: you can use [<-LINK->] to watch for file changes and rebuilding the app.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T13:57:35] <hatrena> pjetr: you can create a container having your most common technologies, and then inherit it from a new container which is having more specific task.
2 [2017-05-04T14:05:04] <hatrena> yes, in a very simple implementation. you can have more layer of inheritance. another application can inherit your custom php container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T15:53:25] <dragon788> also with the newer staged docker builds you can easily compile your app with all it's dependencies and then output a container that is ONLY the app and dependencies
2 [2017-05-04T22:00:22] <dragon788> MaximZavitaev: it depends how your Dockerfile is set up, basically the container does a "bind mount" if you map in a host folder via the volume mount, so it is an immediate write that shows up both places (because they are bound to the same place), if you just want to copy files into the container once, you can use theCOPYcommand in your Dockerfile eg if you wanted to get a compiled artifact into the container in order to run it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-04T21:39:16] <MaximZavitaev> Hi. The volumes are mounted only from the host to the container? That is, changes in the container are synchronized to the host, and changes in the host into the container will not fall? Or I something not so do?
2 [2017-05-04T22:08:59] <MaximZavitaev> @dragon788 i write [<-CODE->] in docker-composechange a file on the host, but the container changes do not fall
3 [2017-05-04T22:21:41] <MaximZavitaev> Everything is fine
4 [2017-05-04T22:23:23] <MaximZavitaev> The problem lies elsewhere. Server on NodeJS should watch for the file to load a file and reload the browser page when changing. Changes appear, but it does not reload the file and page browser
5 [2017-05-05T07:41:22] <MaximZavitaev> pjetr: i use webpack and hot reload.
6 [2017-05-05T07:41:46] <MaximZavitaev> pjetr: with nodemon it will be long enough to build the project

1 [2017-05-05T09:11:13] <Floolean_twitter> Hi there
2 [2017-05-05T09:11:19] <Floolean_twitter> docker newbie here
3 [2017-05-05T09:12:51] <Floolean_twitter> Does anybody know of good articles/resources about (git-)branch dependent deployment and environment setup?
4 [2017-05-05T09:13:37] <Floolean_twitter> i.e.: branch develop deploys to certain cloud provider whereas master deploys to another
5 [2017-05-05T09:13:52] <Floolean_twitter> also setup of unit test containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-05T09:16:59] <hatrena> Floolean_twitter: there were many questions, can you please be more specific ?
2 [2017-05-05T09:20:20] <Floolean_twitter> I try to
3 [2017-05-05T09:22:03] <Floolean_twitter> I have a repo with an app. I want to automatically deploy my dev branch in a certain environment and the production branch in another
4 [2017-05-05T09:22:31] <Floolean_twitter> Different dockerfiles for develop and master I guess?
5 [2017-05-05T09:23:23] <hatrena> you can use github + travis for example. then in your travis based on your branch (dev or master) it can deploy to a specific environment using docker cli
6 [2017-05-05T09:24:07] <hatrena> it depends if ytou want to use docker cloud for deployment for example or any other solutions
7 [2017-05-05T09:24:46] <Floolean_twitter> I use an internal gitlab instance for versioning
8 [2017-05-05T09:25:46] <Floolean_twitter> thanks for the hint, I found a good example project
9 [2017-05-05T09:25:48] <Floolean_twitter>  [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-05-05T09:26:55] <pjetr> I would strongly suggest to add a CI in your workflow, like travis, jenkins, ...
11 [2017-05-05T09:27:17] <pjetr> that way you can make sure that you don't deploy with failing tests
12 [2017-05-05T09:27:19] <hatrena> yes, without CLI, you should deal with a lot of manual work
13 [2017-05-05T09:27:22] <Floolean_twitter> I'm using a gitlab runner
14 [2017-05-05T09:27:48] <pjetr> I'm not familliar with gitlab runner
15 [2017-05-05T09:28:12] <Floolean_twitter> it's a CI provider
16 [2017-05-05T09:28:40] <hatrena> so you can definitely leverage CLI to automate your deployment
17 [2017-05-05T09:29:08] <Floolean_twitter> yes, thank you very much
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-05T09:23:14] <pjetr> wouldn't it be loads easier to this using CI?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-05T13:14:59] <SISheogorath> To deploy your stuff use docker-compose with overwrites. See the docker-compose in production page in the docs about how to do it. This was you can simply define the environment you want to go to. And in your CI description add a simply if clause about what branch your are running to decide the Target for deployment
2 [2017-05-05T20:19:36] <SISheogorath> scippio stop the docker service and remove/var/lib/dockerif you have nothing important like volumes on your system
3 [2017-05-05T20:21:58] <SISheogorath> Alternative is to unassign the IP from your interface and remove the container then
4 [2017-05-05T20:22:36] <SISheogorath> beniamin-kis: removing the docker-compose.yml shouldn't stop or affect any created service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-05T17:03:54] <thebuccaneersden> Floolean_twitter: I’m using DroneCI. It’s an open source self-hosted CI solution which leverages docker containers to execute your builds.
2 [2017-05-05T17:04:44] <thebuccaneersden> I don’t know if you can use Gitlab Runner without having to have the whole Gitlab installation and then you have to do so much more customization to get Gitlab runner set up, in my opinion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-05-06T21:20:19] <gdeverlant> Greetings to all
2 [2017-05-06T21:20:38] <gdeverlant> I'm trying to run a stack with docker
3 [2017-05-06T21:20:47] <gdeverlant> docker stack deploy ...
4 [2017-05-06T21:21:09] <gdeverlant> I'm getting this error for the absolute path mounting
5 [2017-05-06T21:21:09] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-05-06T21:21:52] <gdeverlant> version: "3"services:agency1:image: arangodb/arangodb-arm64:3.2environment: [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-05-06T21:22:34] <gdeverlant> I don't know why normally docker create the folders automatically with docker run etc...
8 [2017-05-06T21:22:53] <gdeverlant> but not in the case of docker stack deploy -f docker-compose.yml
9 [2017-05-06T21:24:10] <gdeverlant> why docker isn't able to create the folder in my cluster
10 [2017-05-06T21:24:23] <gdeverlant> what would be the right solution for this
11 [2017-05-06T21:29:26] <gdeverlant> I might add that I'm running in swarm mode
12 [2017-05-06T21:53:09] <gdeverlant> Isn't docker already running is root mode
13 [2017-05-06T21:53:24] <gdeverlant> so   that it can create folder all over the clusters
14 [2017-05-06T21:54:45] <gdeverlant> how do I do it then?
15 [2017-05-06T21:55:29] <gdeverlant> I have a cluster of 20 I don't want to do all manually
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-06T21:54:20] <SISheogorath> it's not wanted to let docker service automatically create the directories
2 [2017-05-06T21:55:30] <SISheogorath> simple reason: when you use shared volumes means some kind of mount in that path that maybe is simply unavailable at the time of the service creation, the created path would precent you from success mount your shared directory again and break your setup... nothing you want to have
3 [2017-05-06T21:55:41] <SISheogorath> write a script
4 [2017-05-06T21:56:03] <gdeverlant> can this plugin help me [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-05-06T21:56:26] <gdeverlant> I don't know how to write a script
6 [2017-05-06T21:57:20] <SISheogorath> I can't say, maybe it helps, haven't tried it ever so best way to find out if it works is to try it yourself
7 [2017-05-06T21:57:31] <SISheogorath> if you run on arm make sure it provides an arm image
8 [2017-05-06T21:58:15] <gdeverlant> I already compile and made everything for arm
9 [2017-05-06T21:58:31] <SISheogorath> I don't know how to write a scriptBest way to change that is writing one ^^
10 [2017-05-06T21:58:57] <gdeverlant> yeah but I find bash scripting very shitty syntax
11 [2017-05-06T21:59:20] <gdeverlant> I never undertood why the dudes made it so not attractive
12 [2017-05-06T21:59:36] <gdeverlant> It's nothing like any programming language
13 [2017-05-06T21:59:56] <gdeverlant> I can't wrap my head around it right now
14 [2017-05-06T22:00:03] <gdeverlant> I need to find alternatives
15 [2017-05-06T22:55:54] <SISheogorath> write a zsh script :D or a csh script :D
16 [2017-05-06T22:56:19] <SISheogorath> ;) simply POSIX complaint scripting
17 [2017-05-06T22:56:27] <SISheogorath> works perfectly :D
18 [2017-05-06T22:57:03] <SISheogorath> it a bit like JS. Runs nearly everywhere... Has always some problems... But at the end of the day the job is done and it works :D
19 [2017-05-06T23:23:04] <SISheogorath> doesn't really help you in this situation :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-06T23:21:13] <gdeverlant> I think that bash scripting was built by a retarded AI
2 [2017-05-06T23:38:43] <gdeverlant> lol i prefer to use redtamarin
3 [2017-05-06T23:38:55] <gdeverlant> best bash scripting ever

1 [2017-05-07T11:15:29] <sushant91265_twitter> hi, I'm trying to connect to the private npm artifactory within docker container . I tried to create a different network with subnet but still not able to reach the artifactory. Any suggestions?

4 [2017-05-07T16:41:03] <sushant91265_twitter> yes , for this I've to connect to VPN
5 [2017-05-07T16:44:50] <SISheogorath> this could be a problem. You can try to run it withdocker build --network host
6 [2017-05-07T16:44:59] <SISheogorath> with your other flags
7 [2017-05-07T18:25:49] <sushant91265_twitter> nah not working, is it something related to mac machine
8 [2017-05-07T18:26:15] <SISheogorath> oh yes
9 [2017-05-07T18:26:24] <SISheogorath> in case of mac that can't work :D
10 [2017-05-07T18:26:36] <SISheogorath> because docker running in a VM somewhere behind the scenes
11 [2017-05-07T18:40:07] <SISheogorath> at least not as far as I know. But I'm not a mac user so maybe someone using Docker4Mac has a solution

18 [2017-05-08T12:12:49] <gdeverlant> I knew that alpine was not like other distros
19 [2017-05-08T12:13:05] <gdeverlant> My intuition told me that I could not just copy binaries and expect to run it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-08T11:35:39] <anil08250> Hai All
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-08T12:05:08] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: make sure the libs you're depending on are in place. Remember that Alpine uses musl-lib instead of glibc which results in incompatibility when you simply copy programs from a glibc based build. Even in simple static builds parts of the glibc are not automatically bound statically. So make sure you check that back.
2 [2017-05-08T12:06:25] <SISheogorath> And swearing about the incompetence of open source software without showing the reason in source code is not really nice, and can prevent people, who are about to help you, to help you.
3 [2017-05-08T12:07:16] <SISheogorath> As always I suggest [<-LINK->] if you are about to work with an open source Community and want answers
4 [2017-05-08T12:15:27] <SISheogorath> The simplest answer is: you can't. The longer answer is you have to compile it statically and make sure you have all dependencies in place which is in based case just adding a few Symlinks and in Worst-case really build it in a completely static manner.
5 [2017-05-08T12:16:53] <SISheogorath> The easiest way around all this is to simply build your application inside the image, this way it searches and uses the musl-lib and in case of problems your compiler should notify you
6 [2017-05-08T12:18:45] <SISheogorath> Looks fine
7 [2017-05-08T12:20:09] <SISheogorath> Yep, doesn't make the world easier....
8 [2017-05-08T12:20:32] <SISheogorath> The curse of the arm geeks :D
9 [2017-05-08T12:21:17] <gdeverlant> yeah I had to shit rocks because of arm
10 [2017-05-08T12:21:22] <gdeverlant> I've setup my own registry
11 [2017-05-08T12:21:32] <gdeverlant> and building for arm32 and arm64
12 [2017-05-08T12:21:36] <gdeverlant> since I have a cluster
13 [2017-05-08T12:21:40] <gdeverlant> from both
14 [2017-05-08T12:22:24] <gdeverlant> golang is cool but not easy to start using
15 [2017-05-08T12:22:32] <gdeverlant> and alpine is a beast on its own
16 [2017-05-08T12:34:30] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: thanx i just applied
17 [2017-05-08T12:34:34] <gdeverlant> but it is pending

4 [2017-05-08T12:35:36] <renegoretzka> how to make them access just their folder and no bash?
5 [2017-05-08T12:36:08] <gdeverlant> that's a good question check on google
6 [2017-05-08T12:36:20] <gdeverlant> how to set user account with linux and sftp

1 [2017-05-08T14:41:39] <chrisaj> Is this the right forum for asking about how docker affects the networking performance on the host?
2 [2017-05-09T14:15:27] <chrisaj> SISheogorath: Ok thanks. I didn't expect Docker to affect my native network performance but it is! I'm asking the docker community via the Slack channel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-08T14:58:18] <SISheogorath> chrisaj: in General Docker shouldn't effect the network performance a lot as it doesn't do very special things with the host's network. But I can't explain it completely. In case you want some very experienced and detailed answers the best was to go is asking in the [<-LINK->] or the [<-LINK->] .
2 [2017-05-08T16:31:04] <SISheogorath> nuomi: portainer and rancher have something like an "AppStore" but tbh I\'m not a fan of it and I don\'t think they are build to be used by endusers. And for sure not auto-scaling.
3 [2017-05-08T16:36:42] <SISheogorath> Maybe dokku is something you like to checkout too
4 [2017-05-08T22:12:43] <SISheogorath> scippio: the only way to do that is breaking the network isolation of your container and run it with--network host
5 [2017-05-08T22:13:01] <SISheogorath> any reason why you need it?
6 [2017-05-08T22:13:31] <SISheogorath> oh I see you have mutliple interfaces
7 [2017-05-08T22:14:07] <SISheogorath> not really perfect ._. an alternative would be to redirect traffic that has dport 25
8 [2017-05-09T05:18:06] <SISheogorath> vito-c: you should checkout the most recent changes in [<-LINK->] it's possible that it is the case. Can't say much about it but sounds like the plan they had when they splitted out the moby repository
9 [2017-05-09T05:18:34] <SISheogorath> scippio: on what OS are you?
10 [2017-05-09T05:20:28] <vito-c> SISheogorath: they broke a lot of stuff :(
11 [2017-05-09T06:33:33] <SISheogorath> vito-c: possibly, yes :D
12 [2017-05-09T06:37:14] <SISheogorath> shyamsalimkumar: docker-machine is a separated tool to setup VMs with boot2docker and similar images. It's not only useful on windows or mac. You can aslo setup cloud instances on AWS or DO with it. Docker swarm is the orchestrator build in or stand alone provided by docker to allow people to run their containers distributed over the network. So they are not really related to each other but work very nice togehter
13 [2017-05-09T07:59:24] <SISheogorath> scippio: in this case it should work. You should see the same network interfaces in your containers, as you see on your host. And this includes you can use them alike
14 [2017-05-09T08:11:22] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-08T15:30:36] <nuomi> hi channel, I’d like to know how to setup a "container appstore", which is : 1,  runs on a auto-scalable vps cluster, 2, spin up container on-demand, 3, each container ip:port expose to end user.  I’ve read through docs of k8s, swarm, docker-machine, seems none of them address the exact issue here.  so, any hint?
2 [2017-05-08T15:30:47] <nuomi> thanks!!
3 [2017-05-08T16:53:30] <nuomi> thank you@SISheogorath,  dokku runs on single server rather than a cluster, so I cant really use it on production.  But yes, I should definitely dig more into Paas.
4 [2017-05-08T17:01:26] <nuomi> some say deis or Flynn  is the multi host solution to dokku. But I could not find any clue on deis.com website. weird...

1 [2017-05-08T21:41:12] <scippio> hi all.. I\'m using postfix with option "smtp_bind_address" for interface from which I want send e-mails... how I can add this interface "into" docker for this?
2 [2017-05-08T21:41:38] <scippio> smtp_bind_address=<IP of the interface>
3 [2017-05-09T00:24:39] <scippio> SISheogorath: I tried --network host, but it's not working...
4 [2017-05-09T07:29:04] <scippio> SISheogorath: on Debian
5 [2017-05-09T08:10:23] <scippio> SISheogorath: oh... it seems I had there another server (exim) on host. I turned it off... and all is functional now. Thanks for help.

4 [2017-05-09T18:31:13] <SISheogorath> I think that's the most promising place to ask

1 [2017-05-09T22:24:59] <moringaman> Would anyone know why a docker container wouldn’t copy all the files from it’s directory to a mounted volume on the host OS
2 [2017-05-09T22:25:21] <moringaman> Just one of them
3 [2017-05-09T23:54:24] <moringaman> I used the following run commanddocker run -it --name AureliaBoilerPlate -v $(pwd):/var/www/src -p 9000:9000 -p 3001:3001 webgnostics/aurelia
4 [2017-05-09T23:55:50] <moringaman> to mount the volume and only one of the files contained in it appeared on the host although when i nap shot it and browed all files where present in the src folder of the container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-09T22:48:56] <SISheogorath> moringaman: you talk about the way how docker handles normal volumes vs host mounts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T06:54:02] <SISheogorath> zsjohny: like makeing sure a tag is not replaced? As far as I know that's not possible right now. But you can use the image ID to make sure you don't get the wrong image
2 [2017-05-10T06:57:47] <SISheogorath> moringaman: iirc this is not possible because docker uses bind mounts where no creation step happens. That's why it doesn't copy files to your filesystem. If you want to have the files usedocker cpto get them out of your image or named volumes.
3 [2017-05-10T06:59:28] <zsjohny> SISheogorath: but in my prod maybe will be replaced by staging sometime
4 [2017-05-10T07:00:33] <zsjohny> SISheogorath: For example, staging 1.4  prod 1.3  and next deploy the image  will be replaced
5 [2017-05-10T07:01:50] <zsjohny> what way to isolate the image from staging  to prod
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T07:18:49] <SISheogorath> O.o in General you should use version tags. Likeimage:1.3.1andimage:1.3.2.  And specify them in your CD process. If you want to be really sticky, as already mentioned, use the image id, that\'s the only way to be sure you use exactly this image version. Tags likelatestorprodare mutable and should only used as "additional way" to get your image for example if you want to reproduce an issue and want to get the image, that "should" currently run in production.
2 [2017-05-10T09:48:51] <SISheogorath> which framework? For the header? [<-LINK->] the blog itself runs [<-LINK->] or to be more correct: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-05-10T09:51:03] <SISheogorath> zsjohny: if you can explain a bit more detailed how you roll out your images I can maybe give a better advice.
4 [2017-05-10T12:22:02] <SISheogorath> Sounds like it works as expected. It rolls back to previous specification which is another number of scaling. But feel free to open a issue on GitHub if you want to change the behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T09:00:02] <zsjohny> SISheogorath: Thanks ,but In the process of increasing in version ,the version is still likely to be covered. and  I can’t use the tag likelatestorprod. maybe  I can  use diff namespace  or repo and sync  to control it ?
2 [2017-05-10T09:07:54] <zsjohny> SISheogorath: BTW ,I saw you blog so cool ,what is with the framework

1 [2017-05-10T11:08:32] <ctmnz> Hello, I have faced strange (for me) result of the command 'docker service update --rollback servicename'. The strange thing is that when I use docker scale command, it is assumed as an workers image update when when I want to rollback it just scales the service in the swarm down. Should I report this as a bug?

2 [2017-05-10T17:07:39] <NikIvan> Can it happen because of VirtualBox "shared folder"?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T19:16:53] <brittanyrutherford> can we install a complete OS in container?
2 [2017-05-10T19:17:13] <brittanyrutherford> or are containers just for applications, like DB, etc.. ?
3 [2017-05-10T19:17:17] <brittanyrutherford> I am still new to this
4 [2017-05-10T19:17:18] <td444> brittanyrutherford: you can, but defeats the point a bit...
5 [2017-05-10T19:17:34] <td444> one responsability per container ideally
6 [2017-05-10T19:17:53] <td444> many presume container = VM, but its really not their intended use
7 [2017-05-10T19:20:08] <brittanyrutherford> but I see some containers for ubuntu
8 [2017-05-10T19:20:11] <brittanyrutherford> etc
9 [2017-05-10T19:20:35] <brittanyrutherford> so isn't this a vm?
10 [2017-05-10T19:20:52] <td444> yeah, they're a little misleading, more of a very minimal distro (minus system kernel etc) to run your apps or services
11 [2017-05-10T19:21:23] <td444> see [<-LINK->] for example
12 [2017-05-10T19:21:23] <brittanyrutherford> so these are minimal OS?
13 [2017-05-10T19:21:42] <td444> yep
14 [2017-05-10T19:21:53] <brittanyrutherford> what's this alpine?
15 [2017-05-10T19:22:10] <td444> have a look - details on page, another very minimal/reduced linux distro, just enough to get stuff going
16 [2017-05-10T19:22:28] <brittanyrutherford> aha
17 [2017-05-10T19:22:33] <td444>  [<-LINK->]
18 [2017-05-10T19:23:28] <brittanyrutherford> so if containers won't replace vms, what's the usage?
19 [2017-05-10T19:23:47] <brittanyrutherford> i was watching a pluralsight course, and he says: good bye to vmware, welcome containers
20 [2017-05-10T19:26:01] <td444> traditionally prior to containers people used VMs per service to host services etc
21 [2017-05-10T19:26:18] <td444> with containers, you no longer need a big heavy VM just to run a service
22 [2017-05-10T19:27:07] <td444>  [<-LINK->]
23 [2017-05-10T19:27:36] <td444> if your at this level, id suggest going through Docker's own learning material to start with, will help you conceptualise it etc.
24 [2017-05-10T19:30:26] <brittanyrutherford> which level do u mean
25 [2017-05-10T19:30:58] <td444> e.g. Docker getting started, work through it a bit?
26 [2017-05-10T19:31:05] <brittanyrutherford> ah
27 [2017-05-10T19:31:10] <brittanyrutherford> i was watching a pluralsight course
28 [2017-05-10T19:31:12] <brittanyrutherford> it confused me a bit
29 [2017-05-10T19:31:26] <td444> yeah, pluralsight can be hit and miss...
30 [2017-05-10T19:31:38] <td444> often, doing > watching pluralsight
31 [2017-05-10T19:32:07] <brittanyrutherford> but how can I do things without understanding first?
32 [2017-05-10T19:32:39] <td444> follow the getting started guide on Docker's website, its designed for absolute beginners
33 [2017-05-10T19:32:46] <brittanyrutherford> okay
34 [2017-05-10T19:32:52] <brittanyrutherford> thanks@td444
35 [2017-05-10T19:32:58] <td444> rest assured though your not the first person to think container = VM
36 [2017-05-10T19:33:01] <td444> I get this a lot...
37 [2017-05-10T19:33:37] <brittanyrutherford> but when u say apps
38 [2017-05-10T19:33:39] <brittanyrutherford> what kind of apps
39 [2017-05-10T19:33:49] <brittanyrutherford> for example, I saw a container with mongodb
40 [2017-05-10T19:34:02] <brittanyrutherford> can i get a container with mongodb/express/node together?
41 [2017-05-10T19:34:31] <td444> you'd get 2 containers ideally - one for mongodb and one for express + node
42 [2017-05-10T19:34:51] <td444> the idea is to break down the necessary components that make an app into their own containers
43 [2017-05-10T19:34:58] <brittanyrutherford> aha
44 [2017-05-10T19:35:21] <brittanyrutherford> can i have windows server as a container?
45 [2017-05-10T19:35:27] <brittanyrutherford> or that's a stupid question
46 [2017-05-10T19:35:31] <td444> you can, but its really early days
47 [2017-05-10T19:35:46] <td444> i.e. much more of a uphill struggle to get working stable compared to linux based containers
48 [2017-05-10T19:36:01] <brittanyrutherford> aha
49 [2017-05-10T19:36:34] <brittanyrutherford> how do u know how many apps per container?
50 [2017-05-10T19:36:45] <JinnaBalu> Yes you can, better you read about docker, come up with the use case.
51 [2017-05-10T19:37:20] <brittanyrutherford> yeah, i'll start reading the docs
52 [2017-05-10T19:37:25] <td444> honestly i'd start with the Docker literature and go from there, it seems pluralsight has left you in a confused state
53 [2017-05-10T19:38:48] <JinnaBalu> docker official docs are pretty clear. and easy to start a basic container.
54 [2017-05-10T19:39:04] <brittanyrutherford> the thing is, am familiar with windows
55 [2017-05-10T19:39:11] <brittanyrutherford> will these docs be good for me as a windows user?
56 [2017-05-10T19:39:19] <brittanyrutherford> or do I need to have experience with linux?
57 [2017-05-10T19:39:57] <td444>  [<-LINK->] you can use this in Windows to start you off
58 [2017-05-10T19:39:58] <JinnaBalu> do you want to use your own machine to learn or any cloud?
59 [2017-05-10T19:40:36] <brittanyrutherford> yea I will use windows 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T19:33:55] <JinnaBalu> Any apps on the planet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T19:41:31] <JinnaBalu> then you can do with windows?i.e. much more of a uphill struggle to get working stable compared to linux based containers
2 [2017-05-10T19:42:10] <td444> i thought Docker for Windows fires up a Linux VM in the background, letting you get on ?
3 [2017-05-10T19:42:12] <brittanyrutherford> no no, I don't wanna make windows containers
4 [2017-05-10T19:42:21] <brittanyrutherford> I just wanna use my windows OS as host for containers
5 [2017-05-10T19:42:23] <brittanyrutherford> is it hard?
6 [2017-05-10T19:44:15] <JinnaBalu> only some port related issues, build related issues, When you run docker in windows it runs on VM, when you try to build a app which is windows based and trying build docker image on docker, there you face and issue with .exe trying to run on linux.
7 [2017-05-10T19:45:35] <td444> but for what your doing (running linux docker containers) it should be good enough to test
8 [2017-05-10T19:45:41] <td444> in windows that is
9 [2017-05-10T19:45:59] <JinnaBalu> Yes.
10 [2017-05-10T19:46:28] <td444> just give it a try, thats one of the big advanages of Docker vs VM - learning curve is so much smaller to begin with
11 [2017-05-10T19:50:22] <brittanyrutherford> cool
12 [2017-05-10T19:50:39] <brittanyrutherford> thanks guys@JinnaBalu@td444appreciate the help
13 [2017-05-10T19:51:03] <JinnaBalu> please help some one as you learn. hahahahah
14 [2017-05-10T19:51:19] <brittanyrutherford> hehe, help whom?
15 [2017-05-10T19:52:36] <JinnaBalu> Whom? there may be someone who is going to ask same here. as you know some you can right?
16 [2017-05-10T19:53:04] <brittanyrutherford> i am new to this whole thing
17 [2017-05-10T19:53:26] <brittanyrutherford> if I know something I can help someone with, I will
18 [2017-05-10T19:54:13] <JinnaBalu> I feel everyone is new to anything as it keeps on evolving
19 [2017-05-10T19:54:31] <brittanyrutherford> I am just a noob in technology in general
20 [2017-05-10T19:58:06] <td444> we all started somewhere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T20:25:38] <SISheogorath> @brittanyrutherford just to make sure you don\'t get container wrong: the base images like "ubuntu", "debian", "fedora" or "alpine" have one reason: Tooling. [<-CODE->] To run Linux containers on windows you can use Docker4Windows. In it\'s default setup it creates a VM in background which runs linux and executes the containers for you. You shouldn\'t notice it. On docs.docker.com you should find a few easy tutorials. But if you want an more interactive way to learn how to use container even if you have no idea about Linux, maybe http://training.play-with-docker.com is the place you want to visit. The tutorials are very detailed and should help you to get started very easy and fast
2 [2017-05-10T20:27:37] <SISheogorath> moringaman: you can run them directly ->docker exec CONTAINERID /path/to/command arg1 arg2or you have to setup something likesupervisordinside your container which manage these things but I don't recommend it
3 [2017-05-10T20:30:22] <SISheogorath> MajorasJack: have you tried to access your application when it "hangs"? Becausedocker-compose updoesn\'t detach the log so the command "doesn\'t end" by design (if you want to detach it usedocker-compose up -d). Sry if you know that and you\'re sure it\'s a but, just ask to make sure you don\'t miss anything
4 [2017-05-10T20:32:40] <SISheogorath> NikIvan: You use the docker toolbox, don't you? Does [<-LINK->] help?
5 [2017-05-10T20:42:53] <SISheogorath> looks fine, can't say for sure, as I don't use windows or virtual box the easiest way to see if it works or not is testing it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T20:36:17] <NikIvan> SISheogorath: Yes, I am using toolbox. And start docker with "Docker Quickstart Terminal" and Keenetic doens\'t run at all - some weird errors
2 [2017-05-10T20:36:48] <NikIvan> Thank you for sharing this link. I think it's the my problem that moment
3 [2017-05-10T20:37:40] <NikIvan> Because you can setup shared drives with one checkbox in Win10 docker UI and for Win8.1 it makes some pain...
4 [2017-05-10T20:40:20] <NikIvan> SISheogorath: so, let\'s say, if I want to share whole my D drive then I should input something like this:VBoxManage sharedfolder add "boot2docker-vm" --name "D:" --hostpath "D:\\"??
5 [2017-05-10T20:48:43] <NikIvan> SISheogorath: Thank you for help. I will try.
6 [2017-05-10T20:49:19] <NikIvan> By the way, what are you using? Ubuntu? Mac? :)
7 [2017-05-10T20:50:05] <SISheogorath> Fedora :D
8 [2017-05-10T20:50:51] <brittanyrutherford> SISheogorath: thanks :)
9 [2017-05-10T20:51:15] <brittanyrutherford> hello world for docker hehe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T20:51:29] <NikIvan> For historical reasons or it's the best distro nowadays objectively?
2 [2017-05-10T20:51:36] <NikIvan> SISheogorath:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T20:55:13] <SISheogorath> I think objectively there is no best distro :D All distros have their pros and cons. I use fedora because I like the way how Red hat builds it\'s things and for fast support in case something is broken. I guess otherwise I would use Arch or Gentoo. Ubuntu is very stable but I never really got the "ubuntu love" many people like :D It\'s a good distro for people who want to find solutions fast. Their community is very active and the ubuntu user help is very very good. It\'s like every question you can think about as a beginner is already answered somewhere :D But they are often very universal if you invest a few minutes more and work on other distros, too so I don\'t loose anything :D
2 [2017-05-10T22:20:35] <SISheogorath> Docker for Windows doesn't work on Home. (when I recall correct) In this case you have to use the docker toolbox
3 [2017-05-10T22:21:28] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T21:06:03] <brittanyrutherford> why do I need to use container to push my changes to container registry, then to AWS/Azure?
2 [2017-05-10T21:06:19] <brittanyrutherford> I am not seeing the value of docker if it can't replace virtual machines :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T21:41:59] <moringaman> brittanyrutherford: Thanks, what’s the problem with supervisord?
2 [2017-05-10T21:43:31] <brittanyrutherford> moringaman: what supervisord?
3 [2017-05-10T21:47:14] <moringaman> brittanyrutherford: - Apologies I meant to address@SISheogorathwith that question, but I think it’s a process manager for docker containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T21:54:38] <KramKroc> Hi folks. I’m doing some investigation into docker 1.13 & swarm. We use Spring Boot Microservices with Eureka for service discovery of the services. I’m having problems with getting our services to see each other. Some of the services start on the ingress network, and others on the network I created for the stack. It’s pretty confusing and I’m not entirely sure if it’s an issue that I’ve created in docker stack setup or how I define my service definition in Eureka. I’ve created a much smaller microservice system that reproduces the steps I followed and I wondered if someone could take a look to see if I’m missing something from my network definition or service definition in the compose file: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T22:14:07] <brittanyrutherford> I am trying to run docker on windows, since I have windows home edition, i must install docker toolbox, so i was walking through the steps here: [<-LINK->] and I ran the command: docker info   but I got this error
2 [2017-05-10T22:14:28] <brittanyrutherford> error during connect: Get http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.28/info: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified. In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run elevated to connect. This error may also indicate that the docker daemon is not running.
3 [2017-05-10T22:14:46] <brittanyrutherford> any idea?@td444@JinnaBalu@SISheogorath?
4 [2017-05-10T22:25:08] <NikIvan> brittanyrutherford: try to run using the link, that you should have after installation
5 [2017-05-10T22:25:15] <NikIvan> Docker Quickstart Terminal
6 [2017-05-10T22:25:26] <NikIvan> It should start daemon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T22:32:52] <SISheogorath> moringaman: supervisord restart processes inside the docker without let the docker daemon noticing it which possibly breaks some good features. I don't use it in my projects. The official docs recommend it for some cases. [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-05-10T22:36:44] <SISheogorath> KramKroc: how did you create the external network? did you use-d overlay?
3 [2017-05-10T22:45:14] <brittanyrutherford> NikIvan: which link?
4 [2017-05-10T23:04:40] <brittanyrutherford> SISheogorath: ummm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T22:54:15] <SISheogorath> @brittanyrutherfordI am not seeing the value of docker if it can't replace virtual machines :(The idea is that container reduce maintainence work and are reproducible. They are also more efficient in speech of resources like RAM and CPU time. You can imagine that because in a VM you run your own process manager, and own kernel, every kernel process, and remote management software (like SSH or maybe a puppet or Saltstack agent), you run you application, etc. This uses ressources for every VM. And also a VM takes time for booting. which is wasted time. and very expensive time, if your application get's hit by a traffic peak. Container don't need to boot. They need a few milliseconds to setup an isolated kernel environment and their mount points for data and start the process of your application. That's it. Also Containers, other than regular VMs, are images that are not changeable and still maintainable. You build them multiple, maybe more then 20 times a day and deploy them to your entire infrastructure. And as they are immutable you don't have to fear that there is a package corrupt or a config file not correct installed. Last but not least container have a shorter live time than VMs and allow you to run them with a read-only filesystem and minimal tmpfs for needed tempfiles. Which makes them nearly immune against Viruses as there is no place where a virus and other malware can stay.For sure you can build immutable VMs and reproducible VM builds, but there is currently no comparable tooling to docker for that and you still waste tons of resources for nothing when you use VMs instead of Containers
2 [2017-05-10T23:11:04] <SISheogorath> As I mentioned did you check the requirements page? Is your system HyperV capable?
3 [2017-05-10T23:11:54] <SISheogorath> I see
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T23:06:40] <brittanyrutherford> but if all containers share the same kernel, and one of the containers causes a problem or memory leak, it would affect all other containers, right?
2 [2017-05-10T23:07:52] <brittanyrutherford> I am still having issues running either : docker ps or docker info on windows
3 [2017-05-10T23:08:09] <brittanyrutherford> I am getting this error for docker ps
4 [2017-05-10T23:08:15] <brittanyrutherford> error during connect: Get http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.28/containers/json: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified. In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run elevated to connect. This error may also indicate that the docker daemon is not running.
5 [2017-05-10T23:08:29] <brittanyrutherford> and this for running docker info
6 [2017-05-10T23:08:31] <brittanyrutherford> error during connect: Get http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.28/info: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified.

7 [2017-05-10T23:08:47] <brittanyrutherford> which is basically the same error I guess
8 [2017-05-10T23:11:46] <brittanyrutherford> i installed docker toolbox, since I don't have hyperv
9 [2017-05-10T23:11:56] <brittanyrutherford> so i have oracle virtualboxk
10 [2017-05-10T23:12:03] <brittanyrutherford> i can run docker --version
11 [2017-05-10T23:12:13] <brittanyrutherford> docker-compose --version
12 [2017-05-10T23:12:24] <brittanyrutherford> no, the doc didn't say anything about it
13 [2017-05-10T23:12:32] <brittanyrutherford>  [<-LINK->]
14 [2017-05-10T23:12:38] <brittanyrutherford> they just said open a shell
15 [2017-05-10T23:12:41] <brittanyrutherford> so am using gitbash
16 [2017-05-10T23:13:10] <brittanyrutherford> ahaa
17 [2017-05-10T23:13:37] <brittanyrutherford> is it like totally different environment?
18 [2017-05-10T23:14:26] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
19 [2017-05-10T23:14:27] <brittanyrutherford> if I get a linux VM, would it work?
20 [2017-05-10T23:21:29] <brittanyrutherford> that's cool, it worked@SISheogorath:D
21 [2017-05-10T23:21:42] <brittanyrutherford> thanks a lot!
22 [2017-05-10T23:21:55] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
23 [2017-05-10T23:22:36] <SISheogorath> And about the memory leak question: docker uses linux cgroups in kernelspace. This way you can limit the memory allocation like you know it from VMs
24 [2017-05-10T23:23:31] <brittanyrutherford> aha, am not that familiar with VMs, I only used VmWare
25 [2017-05-10T23:23:46] <brittanyrutherford> i just started learning node/mongodb, and I want to learn about docker as well
26 [2017-05-10T23:23:58] <brittanyrutherford> and see how I can make everything work together
27 [2017-05-10T23:24:38] <brittanyrutherford> Question, after the "Step 3: Verify your installation" in the docs, do I return back to the original docs?
28 [2017-05-10T23:24:42] <brittanyrutherford> for windows?
29 [2017-05-10T23:25:28] <SISheogorath> you should be able to run docker like docker for windows as long as you use the quickstart terminal. Can't say for sure (never used it myself) but iirc it should work
30 [2017-05-10T23:31:09] <SISheogorath> docker run hello-worlddoesn't work?
31 [2017-05-10T23:31:29] <SISheogorath> you should be able to follow it
32 [2017-05-10T23:32:02] <SISheogorath> does should work like everywhere (more or less. you may run into trouble with port mappings or host mounts :/)
33 [2017-05-10T23:33:11] <brittanyrutherford> it works
34 [2017-05-10T23:33:27] <brittanyrutherford> but I mean, can't i follow the get started link?
35 [2017-05-10T23:33:32] <brittanyrutherford> not the one for windows?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T23:12:12] <SISheogorath> you use the docker quickstart terminal?
2 [2017-05-10T23:12:55] <SISheogorath> in this case you are back to the docker4Windows docs. You have to see the docker toolbox docs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T23:26:06] <brittanyrutherford> but I can't follow the this? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-10T23:45:21] <SISheogorath> you possibly can. In general docker toolbox sets up a docker VM and docker tools for windows so you use it from this powershell environment the quickstart terminal sets up for you. I can't say a lot about details, but it sounds like@NikIvancan maybe explain it more detailed as he uses it actively
2 [2017-05-11T00:05:54] <brittanyrutherford> SISheogorath: thank you
3 [2017-05-11T08:33:36] <SISheogorath> briantyr: the only sockets you really need to secure are the ones you expose. In this case you shouldn't expose more than needed which means the only should expose the sockets of the manager nodes. But in general if you really want it it also works for worker nodes, too. Yes, you can secure them the same way you secured non-swarm-mode nodes and use thrm alike, even when I don't recommend it.
4 [2017-05-11T08:34:50] <SISheogorath> For the registry I simply recommend to not use a self-signed certificate. Since Let's encrypt exists there is no real reason to use a self-signed one
5 [2017-05-11T08:34:51] <briantyr> SISheogorath: thanks, you mean expose the TCP sockets  and not the unix docker.socket?
6 [2017-05-11T08:35:12] <briantyr> i thought the registry had to use the same as the docker cluster... guess I know nothing
7 [2017-05-11T08:35:20] <briantyr> acatually it makes sense that it wouldnt
8 [2017-05-11T08:35:33] <briantyr> considering docker hub and billions of ppl from pulling from it on their own swarm..
9 [2017-05-11T08:36:00] <SISheogorath> The registry does normal validation like wget or curl when you download something
10 [2017-05-11T08:36:38] <SISheogorath> And yes I was talking about the TCP socket

12 [2017-05-11T08:42:03] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
13 [2017-05-11T08:42:58] <SISheogorath> Yes you can use multiple instances with S3 backend
14 [2017-05-11T08:44:14] <SISheogorath> I'm in general not an Amazon guy so :D can't tell you much about their way to do things in general. My setups are distributed between smaller cloud providers ^^
15 [2017-05-11T08:45:19] <SISheogorath> KramKroc: how did you check the netwoeks the nodes are on?
16 [2017-05-11T09:00:40] <SISheogorath> It's normal they are on the ingress network as long as they expose a port
17 [2017-05-11T10:58:22] <SISheogorath> I'm nit completely sure what you mean here. They need the ingress overlay network in swarm because it's the docker routing mesh for swarm mode and used to find the right container
18 [2017-05-11T10:58:51] <SISheogorath> And they use the network you created for container-to-container communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T07:06:47] <KramKroc> SISheogorath: hi, yes, I created the network with -d overlay [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T08:19:33] <briantyr> hey everyone, setting up a docker swarm env in AWS on 8 nodes ( 3 manager, 5 swarms - using Docker CE).  Is it fine if I create my own CA and use that to sign the certs for each docker daemon's TLS cert?  If so, can I put something like nginx between the Swarm cluster and the users themselves so they won't see any issues with invalid CA or anything like that?  Finally, if I create my own Docker Registry, will that work alright with the fake CA's / self-signed certs?  I'm doing this on AWS , and have a private hosted zone.swarm.example.com and a public zone of.example.com..   any ideas?
2 [2017-05-11T08:36:26] <briantyr> so yeah, basically I already have the nodes running, they are listening on the 2376 port and i'm at the point where I need to generate the CA and self-signed certs... unfortunately this is due in a few hours (that + verifying swarm and testing 15 containers end to end yayyy)
3 [2017-05-11T08:36:40] <briantyr> iw was goign to use letsencrypt everywhere else
4 [2017-05-11T08:37:06] <SISheogorath> In general it doesn't really matter
5 [2017-05-11T08:37:36] <briantyr> im doing this in AWS, do you by chance thinkk there is an ideal AWS instance type for Docker (that is affordable, like m4.xlarge and less)?
6 [2017-05-11T08:37:59] <briantyr> I want this for long term development environment by 50+ devs
7 [2017-05-11T08:38:25] <briantyr> so it will add up quickly, but I have used Packer to create an AMI with an initial 200gb per node and I use LVM
8 [2017-05-11T08:38:50] <briantyr> yeah im reading that link now :)
9 [2017-05-11T08:39:16] <briantyr> we have over 200 containers we'll be running initially
10 [2017-05-11T08:39:31] <SISheogorath> There is docker4AWS if you talk about an "ideal setup" ;)
11 [2017-05-11T08:39:46] <briantyr> I used nginx (openresty) + consul + consul-template before and was going with  that again probably
12 [2017-05-11T08:39:47] <SISheogorath> Everything important already preconfigured
13 [2017-05-11T08:39:51] <briantyr> nooo!
14 [2017-05-11T08:40:00] <briantyr> well dont you have to pay for it
15 [2017-05-11T08:40:05] <briantyr> and isnt it somewhat restricted in features?
16 [2017-05-11T08:41:26] <briantyr> i like to have full control and learn stuff too :)  If I can just get 3-4 nodes up, get swarm with TLS working, and then have an ELB/ALB  work with the external facing load balancer that routes into the swarm, I'm good.  I'll try to get a load balancer on the registry too, from what I understand you're able to use multiple instances of it backed by S3
17 [2017-05-11T08:41:43] <briantyr> sound right to you@SISheogorath? :)
18 [2017-05-11T08:44:01] <briantyr> awesome thats what I thought ... thanks for confirming that for me
19 [2017-05-11T08:44:06] <briantyr> much appreciated it man
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T08:52:10] <KramKroc> Hi@SISheogorathI did a docker network inspect and they seem to be present in both the ingress network and the demo-network
2 [2017-05-11T09:43:39] <KramKroc> SISheogorath: is there any reason why they can’t communicate from one network to the other?
3 [2017-05-11T12:35:18] <KramKroc> SISheogorath: I meant that fromcontainer Ai canpingthe ip address forcontainer Bfor it’s IP address on the ingress network and the container network. But when I do awgetfrom container A, it only works for the ip address on the container network.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T09:32:41] <moringaman> SISheogorath: Good to know, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T11:09:26] <HendrikRoth> Hello i have a basic question.. i would like base my dockerimage on an other automatic docker build. But how can i override the ENTRYPOINT? After trying, the image is not working anymore (no error log, just exists direct)
2 [2017-05-11T11:13:49] <HendrikRoth>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-05-11T11:31:52] <HendrikRoth> SISheogorath: without tini i have the same issue
4 [2017-05-11T11:35:57] <HendrikRoth> or is it not possible to overwrite an entrypoint?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T11:30:08] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure howtiniacts here I'm pretty sure that the Dockerfile is fine and the entrypoint script itself is also okay. The only component that can cause problems in my opinion istinias I never used it and have no idea how exactly it reacts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T11:31:38] <NikIvan> SISheogorath: @brittanyrutherfordAt last I've started my project on Win8.1. The main steps I was missing are
2 [2017-05-11T11:32:22] <NikIvan> Share project folder using VirtualBox machine preferences to my docker VM
3 [2017-05-11T11:32:47] <NikIvan> Link ports 80 of my VM to my host 80
4 [2017-05-11T11:33:38] <NikIvan> So, it looks like I have double port forwarding - from container to VM and then from VM to host
5 [2017-05-11T11:34:13] <NikIvan> Such a pain... :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:17:18] <brittanyrutherford> NikIvan: thanks
2 [2017-05-11T13:19:43] <brittanyrutherford> what is docker hello-world?
3 [2017-05-11T13:19:54] <brittanyrutherford> they say on the website that it gets an image.. but an image for what?
4 [2017-05-11T13:19:59] <brittanyrutherford> what did I just download??
5 [2017-05-11T13:21:43] <brittanyrutherford> yea am in windows docker documentation, I am going to install ubuntu now
6 [2017-05-11T13:21:57] <brittanyrutherford> will download the ubuntu container image and start it.
7 [2017-05-11T13:22:13] <brittanyrutherford> but I didn't understand the hello-world part, what is that
8 [2017-05-11T13:23:27] <JinnaBalu> It is just a static helloworld page docker image, so that we can test whether docker installed or not.
9 [2017-05-11T13:23:45] <brittanyrutherford> umm
10 [2017-05-11T13:23:56] <brittanyrutherford> in the docs, it said:docker run -it ubuntu bash
11 [2017-05-11T13:24:03] <brittanyrutherford> but how do I use it?\\
12 [2017-05-11T13:24:22] <brittanyrutherford> they are just making me execute commands and not telling me what's going on ..
13 [2017-05-11T13:25:05] <brittanyrutherford> when I ran this command: docker run -it ubuntu bash
14 [2017-05-11T13:25:23] <brittanyrutherford> now the terminal is waiting for me to type something, at :root@3aa3a42b80b9:/#

16 [2017-05-11T13:26:18] <brittanyrutherford> see here
17 [2017-05-11T13:26:22] <brittanyrutherford> what should I type?
18 [2017-05-11T13:26:29] <brittanyrutherford> it's waiting for me to type something
19 [2017-05-11T13:27:15] <brittanyrutherford> i just typed exit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:20:50] <JinnaBalu>  [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-05-11T13:21:10] <JinnaBalu> follow this steps.
3 [2017-05-11T13:24:16] <JinnaBalu>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-05-11T13:24:22] <JinnaBalu> this i sthe image.

6 [2017-05-11T13:25:43] <JinnaBalu> then bash into it
7 [2017-05-11T13:25:58] <JinnaBalu> so that you can use that container as a OS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:27:20] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: when you rundocker run -it ubuntu bashit is saying "hey docker,runan interactive terminal (-i+-t=-it) on the imageubuntuthe commandbash
2 [2017-05-11T13:27:59] <purefan> its not expecting you to write anything, if you were able to runbashthen it worked
3 [2017-05-11T13:28:14] <purefan> you can use it for something else but the point of the hello-world is just to test that it worked
4 [2017-05-11T13:28:22] <brittanyrutherford> am not familiar with ubuntu.. that's why am on windows docs  what is bash
5 [2017-05-11T13:29:02] <purefan> (hope there are no die hard linux fans here) but bash is like a terminal, its like if you're in CMD and run powershell, or viceversa
6 [2017-05-11T13:29:20] <brittanyrutherford> i know ubuntu is an OS
7 [2017-05-11T13:29:26] <purefan> so yeah you can run programs from bash, it's like powershell in many ways
8 [2017-05-11T13:29:32] <brittanyrutherford> I was expecting to give me an IP so I can navigate to the OS remotely
9 [2017-05-11T13:29:45] <purefan> I dont think the hello world sets up all that for you
10 [2017-05-11T13:29:53] <brittanyrutherford> no, not hello world
11 [2017-05-11T13:29:58] <brittanyrutherford> this
12 [2017-05-11T13:30:00] <brittanyrutherford>  [<-CODE->]
13 [2017-05-11T13:30:17] <brittanyrutherford> didn't i download ubuntu image? why can't I open the OS remotely?
14 [2017-05-11T13:30:31] <purefan> ok so that is running on a docker container called ubuntu, this docker container may have installed a bunch of stuff automatically, but maybe its just a bare bones OS image
15 [2017-05-11T13:30:41] <purefan> JinnaBalu: I think she's way past that point
16 [2017-05-11T13:31:16] <brittanyrutherford> I have kitemantics
17 [2017-05-11T13:31:19] <brittanyrutherford> but am using the CLI
18 [2017-05-11T13:31:34] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: you did start a docker container that runs ubuntu, but if you want to browse to that container with say google chrome you need to install a webserver inside the ubuntu container
19 [2017-05-11T13:31:37] <brittanyrutherford> am just walking through the docker for windows documentation
20 [2017-05-11T13:32:03] <brittanyrutherford> ahaa
21 [2017-05-11T13:32:15] <brittanyrutherford> I thought Ubuntu is like windows, where I can open RDP and navigate to it
22 [2017-05-11T13:32:19] <brittanyrutherford> and see desktop/icons
23 [2017-05-11T13:32:32] <purefan> you can do that but you need to install a bunch of stuff
24 [2017-05-11T13:32:48] <purefan> for example if your ubuntu image is a server it doesn't have a windows manager installed
25 [2017-05-11T13:32:54] <brittanyrutherford> so why do u use Ubuntu without a GUI?
26 [2017-05-11T13:33:07] <JinnaBalu> am just walking through the docker for windows documentation Better do this first and come up with questions. and google will help more than everyone else.
27 [2017-05-11T13:33:17] <purefan> because there's no need for a GUI :) we automate everything with scripts and run commands
28 [2017-05-11T13:33:25] <JinnaBalu> hahahah
29 [2017-05-11T13:33:30] <brittanyrutherford> aha
30 [2017-05-11T13:34:05] <brittanyrutherford> JinnaBalu: I am reading it, but I found myself executing commands and not understanding why am doing them, and I am still clueless in all of this to search on google, I don't know what to search for in the first place
31 [2017-05-11T13:34:33] <brittanyrutherford> anyway, thanks a lot everyone
32 [2017-05-11T13:34:38] <brittanyrutherford> sorry for my dumb questions
33 [2017-05-11T13:35:55] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: this : [<-LINK->]
34 [2017-05-11T13:36:04] <brittanyrutherford> people posted this on freecodecamp page
35 [2017-05-11T13:36:36] <brittanyrutherford> so I watched this pluralsight course (1 hour introduction), and the guy said that many things will be shifted to docker
36 [2017-05-11T13:37:00] <brittanyrutherford> so I started checking it out and see if I can take my node apps to docker
37 [2017-05-11T13:37:03] <brittanyrutherford> and containers
38 [2017-05-11T13:37:13] <brittanyrutherford> I don't know what am doing or why I might need it
39 [2017-05-11T13:37:17] <brittanyrutherford> so am checking it out
40 [2017-05-11T13:37:35] <brittanyrutherford> as I said, I am a windows user
41 [2017-05-11T13:37:45] <brittanyrutherford> I come from ASP.NET background
42 [2017-05-11T13:37:54] <brittanyrutherford> so I am even new to node world
43 [2017-05-11T13:38:32] <brittanyrutherford> JinnaBalu: yeah, that's what I wanna do eventually, that's why am reading the docs
44 [2017-05-11T13:38:44] <brittanyrutherford> but I got lost with all these commands, and not knowing why am executing them
45 [2017-05-11T13:39:21] <brittanyrutherford> in the docs they just say: take this command, run it.. u will have a container.. take this next command, run it, u will have a container.. ok ??? :S
46 [2017-05-11T13:39:25] <brittanyrutherford> that's when I asked u guys
47 [2017-05-11T13:41:26] <brittanyrutherford> I executed this command:docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginxas written here: [<-LINK->]
48 [2017-05-11T13:41:41] <brittanyrutherford> they said: > Point your web browser at [<-LINK->] to display the start page.
49 [2017-05-11T13:41:59] <brittanyrutherford> i navigated to localhost, but there's nothing ..
50 [2017-05-11T13:42:13] <brittanyrutherford> thanks@JinnaBalu
51 [2017-05-11T13:42:20] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: I will check that out, thanks
52 [2017-05-11T13:42:45] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: -@JinnaBalu's will better
53 [2017-05-11T13:43:20] <brittanyrutherford> why am I not seeing anything in [<-LINK->] ?
54 [2017-05-11T13:43:47] <brittanyrutherford> shouldn't this command run a web server ?docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx?
55 [2017-05-11T13:44:24] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: almost, it depends on the nginx configuration, it assumes that nginx was installed
56 [2017-05-11T13:44:54] <brittanyrutherford> isn't nginx an image?
57 [2017-05-11T13:45:00] <brittanyrutherford> do I need to install stuff locally?
58 [2017-05-11T13:45:07] <JinnaBalu> port issue, goto kitematics and expose the port. Basically try all images in Kitematics. and try to run them using command prompt. so you will understand.
59 [2017-05-11T13:45:38] <brittanyrutherford> oik
60 [2017-05-11T13:45:53] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: nginx is a web server, like apache or IIS, it needs to be installed in thewebservercontainer
61 [2017-05-11T13:45:55] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: it should work - I just tried it on my mac and that did show the default "Welcome to nginx"
62 [2017-05-11T13:45:59] <JinnaBalu> everything runs on container. when you stop container it disapears and your memory will be free.
63 [2017-05-11T13:46:23] <rbuckland> You're on Windows yes ?
64 [2017-05-11T13:46:40] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: yea
65 [2017-05-11T13:46:44] <brittanyrutherford> hmmm
66 [2017-05-11T13:46:56] <brittanyrutherford> what if i have multiple containers with web servers
67 [2017-05-11T13:47:01] <brittanyrutherford> then i run docker run webserver
68 [2017-05-11T13:47:07] <brittanyrutherford> which one will be running?
69 [2017-05-11T13:47:26] <purefan> in your examplewebserveris the name of only one of your containers, you cannot have duplicate names
70 [2017-05-11T13:47:30] <rbuckland> trydocker run -d -p 8001:80 --name webserver nginxand then navigate to [<-LINK->]
71 [2017-05-11T13:47:34] <brittanyrutherford> aaah
72 [2017-05-11T13:47:40] <brittanyrutherford> purefan: got u
73 [2017-05-11T13:47:42] <JinnaBalu>  [<-CODE->]
74 [2017-05-11T13:47:58] <JinnaBalu> docker run -d -p 80:80 --name sample nginx
75 [2017-05-11T13:47:59] <brittanyrutherford> that was a misleading server name
76 [2017-05-11T13:48:06] <purefan> :D
77 [2017-05-11T13:48:41] <purefan> here's the [<-LINK->] btw, a lot to read but a good reference when looking for what a specific command does
78 [2017-05-11T13:49:31] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: same thing: [<-LINK->]
79 [2017-05-11T13:49:58] <brittanyrutherford> purefan: yeah, am still going through : [<-LINK->]
80 [2017-05-11T13:50:02] <brittanyrutherford> but it's confusing
81 [2017-05-11T13:50:32] <purefan> dont sweat it, in case you haven't noticed there's a bunch of good folks here willing to help :)
82 [2017-05-11T13:51:16] <purefan> also, it helps that yours are newbie questions, wait until you get to the networking bits and you'll see far less people jumping in
83 [2017-05-11T13:51:36] <brittanyrutherford> haha, I opened kitemantics, and navigated to ports
84 [2017-05-11T13:52:09] <brittanyrutherford> and saw something like this:
85 [2017-05-11T13:52:17] <brittanyrutherford>  [<-LINK->]
86 [2017-05-11T13:52:37] <brittanyrutherford> so i opened this: [<-LINK->] .. and it opened my website !!!
87 [2017-05-11T13:52:45] <brittanyrutherford> no idea why localhost didn't work
88 [2017-05-11T13:53:15] <purefan> oh boy... now we\'re getting into the"networking bits"xD
89 [2017-05-11T13:54:16] <purefan> I guess the explanation is becauselocalhostis a loopback interface and it skips the DNS, maybe related to the network bridge docker creates on windows but not really sure
90 [2017-05-11T13:54:28] <brittanyrutherford> hmmm
91 [2017-05-11T13:54:34] <purefan> lets throw another word in there --> dhcp
92 [2017-05-11T13:54:35] <rbuckland> purefan: it is for that reason.
93 [2017-05-11T13:54:42] <brittanyrutherford> i might just map localhost to 192 in the host file
94 [2017-05-11T13:54:49] <purefan> Woohooo! :D I was at least 31% unsure
95 [2017-05-11T13:54:53] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: no don't do that.
96 [2017-05-11T13:55:09] <rbuckland> just know that your docker "container" is running on 99.100
97 [2017-05-11T13:55:16] <purefan> that would basically implode your windows and make your coffee salty
98 [2017-05-11T13:55:19] <brittanyrutherford> ok
99 [2017-05-11T13:55:24] <brittanyrutherford> haha
100 [2017-05-11T13:55:37] <SISheogorath> HendrikRoth: only the lastENTRYPOINTtag is used for your container. you can overwrite it for sure
101 [2017-05-11T13:56:05] <brittanyrutherford> when I executed the command second time with a new -name webserver2 .. it made one quickly for me :O
102 [2017-05-11T13:56:11] <brittanyrutherford> that's cool
103 [2017-05-11T13:56:46] <rbuckland> purefan: the localhost is still resolved to a local IP 127.0.0.1.. but@brittanyrutherfordcontainer is not running on her windows machine "natively" .. or "locally" it is running ina virt machine, and that virt machine has the ip of 192.168.99.100
104 [2017-05-11T13:57:42] <rbuckland> purefan: I am so sorry :-D
105 [2017-05-11T13:57:51] <rbuckland> that is a shame.
106 [2017-05-11T13:58:15] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: that explains things
107 [2017-05-11T13:59:52] <rbuckland> your windows box has (most likely) a 192.168.99.x IP address .. so that your windows machine and the docker host (the engine running the containers) can talk to each other.
108 [2017-05-11T14:00:36] <rbuckland> I am "long time since"running windows .. but Start > run > cmd > ipconfig .. shows you your windows box IP\'s
109 [2017-05-11T14:00:42] <rbuckland> or ipconfig /all
110 [2017-05-11T14:00:48] <rbuckland> (there are other ways).
111 [2017-05-11T14:01:04] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: actually my IP is : 192.168.3.40
112 [2017-05-11T14:01:28] <rbuckland> that is your "internet" one ... it has another .. on the 192.168.99.x (potentially)
113 [2017-05-11T14:01:39] <brittanyrutherford> this is my lan IP
114 [2017-05-11T14:01:57] <brittanyrutherford> oracle virtual box IP: 192.168.99.1
115 [2017-05-11T14:02:10] <rbuckland> Yes - that is your other one.
116 [2017-05-11T14:02:36] <rbuckland> learning alittleabout networking will help you a long long way.
117 [2017-05-11T14:03:24] <brittanyrutherford> actually oracle has 2 IPs..Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network:   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.56.1Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network [<-ISSUE->] : IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.99.1
118 [2017-05-11T14:04:08] <brittanyrutherford> then I have the Lan adapter: IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.3.40
119 [2017-05-11T14:04:16] <rbuckland> Yes that is often the case that Virtualbox sets up a few networks for you.
120 [2017-05-11T14:04:46] <rbuckland> They are all "local" for you only. (unless you do magic hocus to expose them via bridges and the like(.
121 [2017-05-11T14:04:50] <brittanyrutherford> maybe it's sufficient to have only 2 first numbers to be the same: 192.168
122 [2017-05-11T14:05:11] <rbuckland> 192.168.x.xis a private IP address space
123 [2017-05-11T14:05:12] <brittanyrutherford> anyway
124 [2017-05-11T14:05:30] <rbuckland> most peoples home routers will also use that IP address - space.
125 [2017-05-11T14:06:21] <brittanyrutherford> aha
126 [2017-05-11T14:06:26] <brittanyrutherford> i think am on track now :D
127 [2017-05-11T14:06:46] <brittanyrutherford> thanks for everything guys@rbuckland@purefan@JinnaBalu
128 [2017-05-11T14:06:53] <rbuckland> It will help and confuse you to know that your "webserver" container - inside the container hasanotherIP address again.
129 [2017-05-11T14:07:05] <brittanyrutherford> :O
130 [2017-05-11T14:07:39] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: I don't wanna know that ..
131 [2017-05-11T14:07:41] <brittanyrutherford> haha
132 [2017-05-11T14:07:57] <rbuckland> typically that IP address (for docker) is172.16-17.x.x.
133 [2017-05-11T14:07:58] <purefan> or that you can ssh into your container and ssh into another container and ssh into....
134 [2017-05-11T14:08:09] <brittanyrutherford> :S
135 [2017-05-11T14:08:19] <brittanyrutherford> formatting windows in 5 mins ..
136 [2017-05-11T14:08:19] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: enjoy!
137 [2017-05-11T14:08:19] <brittanyrutherford> haha
138 [2017-05-11T14:08:56] <brittanyrutherford> I love windows :'(
139 [2017-05-11T14:09:05] <purefan> ... we have cookies...
140 [2017-05-11T14:09:11] <brittanyrutherford> I am lost with all the distros stuff
141 [2017-05-11T14:09:11] <purefan> (I may have lied about the cookies)
142 [2017-05-11T14:09:15] <brittanyrutherford> it confuses me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:30:31] <JinnaBalu> You can install on Windows. Use Kitamatics GUI based. for windows users. [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-05-11T13:31:35] <JinnaBalu> Use Kitamatics, it will help you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:31:47] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: the base ubuntu docker image is "bare bones", it has nothing in there really. you would need to add an ssh-server if you want to "connect to it" remotely. but I also don;\'t think you would be looking for that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:35:12] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: I politely ask, what are you wanting to learn out of Docker ? What was the reason you came to investigate docker ? (great place to look :-) )
2 [2017-05-11T13:37:52] <rbuckland> Okay - so .. docker is many things - but a "container" is a way to "package" your application and deploy it. or give it to someone else to deploy it ,or automate the deployment of it.
3 [2017-05-11T13:38:12] <JinnaBalu> create a application simple one and try to run that with docker.
4 [2017-05-11T13:38:33] <rbuckland> you can create a "node" application, your next great idea as a web app, and deploy that node application, in a docker container (wrap it up) .. and run it somewhere.
5 [2017-05-11T13:39:49] <rbuckland> see how you go with this - [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-05-11T13:41:11] <rbuckland> where ever that article talks about "boot2docker", that has now been replaced (updated) with "Docker for Mac"

8 [2017-05-11T13:41:47] <JinnaBalu> do this course.
9 [2017-05-11T13:42:00] <JinnaBalu> its about 30minc to complete
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:52:33] <SISheogorath> KramKroc: I'm not completely sure right now but I guess it's part of the network isolation stack. Check the IPtables forward rules. And in general there is some crazy stuff the with docker-proxy so I wouldn't wonder why the ingress network is handled uncommon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T13:57:17] <purefan> Im running behind a corporate proxy, and part of the set up is thatlocalhostmaps to an external ip, had to addlocal.devto my hosts file and map it to 127.0.0.1
2 [2017-05-11T13:59:03] <purefan> it reaallyy iss... I also run into a bunch of issues with virtual machines, had debian magically installed when I was handed the computer and have failed to set up a copy of that, dont need vms for day to day work but it does suck big time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:07:09] <purefan>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:08:43] <purefan> yeah!! install some linux distro, come to the dark side!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:11:17] <purefan> totally side note, we\'re working on aws deployments with terraform and jinja templates, my colleague just said "remember that 1 database rds you finished yesterday? why do I end up with 2 RDSs?"
2 [2017-05-11T14:11:50] <brittanyrutherford> on a side note, what's RDS? :S
3 [2017-05-11T14:13:39] <purefan> its Amazon's Relational Database Server
4 [2017-05-11T14:13:58] <purefan> have you looked into AWS?
5 [2017-05-11T14:14:17] <brittanyrutherford> no, I looked into Azure
6 [2017-05-11T14:14:27] <brittanyrutherford> I am an ASP.NET developer haha
7 [2017-05-11T14:14:37] <brittanyrutherford> AWS is the dark world for me
8 [2017-05-11T14:14:47] <purefan> well its almost the same thing, just not tied to microsoft, you can run anything microsoft on it though
9 [2017-05-11T14:14:54] <brittanyrutherford> note, am not good in azure too
10 [2017-05-11T14:15:33] <purefan> AWS came before Azure, I trust it way more than Azure but Im biased, most everything I've ever done on cloud is on AWS
11 [2017-05-11T14:15:41] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford:  [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-05-11T14:15:44] <brittanyrutherford> I have been always a business analyst, for 4 years , switch to ASP.NET for 6 months, and now node and docker
13 [2017-05-11T14:15:54] <purefan> node is fun :)
14 [2017-05-11T14:16:01] <brittanyrutherford> yeah, I like it
15 [2017-05-11T14:16:04] <purefan>  [<-LINK->] --> just in case
16 [2017-05-11T14:16:08] <brittanyrutherford> more than ASP.NET
17 [2017-05-11T14:16:15] <purefan> oh yeah.....
18 [2017-05-11T14:16:21] <purefan> asp is old too :P
19 [2017-05-11T14:16:30] <brittanyrutherford> Microsoft released ASP.NET core now
20 [2017-05-11T14:16:41] <brittanyrutherford> it's very much faster than Node, and runs on Linux
21 [2017-05-11T14:17:01] <brittanyrutherford> the processes per second is incredible
22 [2017-05-11T14:17:05] <brittanyrutherford> I just don't like C#
23 [2017-05-11T14:17:11] <td444> lack of community
24 [2017-05-11T14:17:15] <td444> lack of OSS loving
25 [2017-05-11T14:17:22] <brittanyrutherford> yeah, but it's open source now
26 [2017-05-11T14:17:34] <td444> making it OSS doesnt make people flock to things
27 [2017-05-11T14:17:45] <td444> as a result Node etc has a far richer, diverse ecosystem (even if its not all good)
28 [2017-05-11T14:17:47] <brittanyrutherford> and considering it's faster than Node, it might have a value
29 [2017-05-11T14:17:56] <td444> Node is fast enough for most things...
30 [2017-05-11T14:18:11] <brittanyrutherford> yeah true
31 [2017-05-11T14:18:18] <brittanyrutherford> I just hate C#
32 [2017-05-11T14:18:24] <brittanyrutherford> i don't like java or c#
33 [2017-05-11T14:18:28] <brittanyrutherford> that's why I was a business analyst
34 [2017-05-11T14:18:31] <brittanyrutherford> but I love javascript
35 [2017-05-11T14:18:55] <brittanyrutherford> when they make asp.net core written in javascript, i will switch to it
36 [2017-05-11T14:19:18] <td444> just use node
37 [2017-05-11T14:19:23] <brittanyrutherford> yeah I love node
38 [2017-05-11T14:19:32] <brittanyrutherford> it's what made me love to do programs etc..
39 [2017-05-11T14:19:40] <brittanyrutherford> with C# it felt like am forced to code
40 [2017-05-11T14:19:48] <brittanyrutherford> I didn't try things out in my free time
41 [2017-05-11T14:20:17] <brittanyrutherford> lambda? I hate that word.. reminds me of C# terminologies
42 [2017-05-11T14:20:27] <brittanyrutherford> "lambda expressions"
43 [2017-05-11T14:21:34] <purefan> JinnaBalu: sorry for deviating
44 [2017-05-11T14:21:59] <purefan> elcolie: whats up? :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:17:04] <td444> ASP.NET core itself is quite decent, but it has the same problem as ASP.NET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:18:19] <purefan> I dont really like the arguments of "x programming language is faster", there are waaayyy too many variables to take into account and specific use cases, often a programming language is not designed to handle the same things as another one
2 [2017-05-11T14:18:31] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: Im with you on those!
3 [2017-05-11T14:19:56] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: AWS has lambda, you can run nodejs functions "without a server" ;)
4 [2017-05-11T14:28:31] <purefan> I guess this is one of the networking bits I was talking about :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:18:30] <JinnaBalu> fight should be on docker please, hahahhaha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:21:08] <JinnaBalu> brittanyrutherford: ,@purefandocker /docker , we need to help people who have doubts on docker. 1-1 window would be better for other discussion may be.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:21:23] <elcolie> I need help
2 [2017-05-11T14:22:23] <elcolie> My container does not resolve correct IP and Port
3 [2017-05-11T14:24:48] <elcolie>  [<-CODE->] And the Problem is: [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-05-11T14:25:32] <elcolie> I have install and hasredis-serverup and running already [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-05-11T14:25:45] <elcolie> Host OS is Ubuntu xenial
6 [2017-05-11T14:29:12] <elcolie> It should not call port53. It must find6379right?
7 [2017-05-11T14:29:15] <brittanyrutherford> rbuckland: would figure it out i believe
8 [2017-05-11T14:29:42] <purefan> yeah he seems to know his networking stuff
9 [2017-05-11T14:30:06] <elcolie> ok
10 [2017-05-11T14:30:40] <brittanyrutherford> what's meant by: When Docker is running ... is it a backend service that's running? I thought when u execute a command in terminal, then it runs docker, once it's done, it just goes off.. much like Node when u execute Node .. u can do something
11 [2017-05-11T14:31:09] <brittanyrutherford> am looking at the windows tray
12 [2017-05-11T14:31:15] <brittanyrutherford> and there's no whale icon there
13 [2017-05-11T14:35:36] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: you can run a command against a container and once it finishes you get your terminal back, just like in node. The container doesn\'t stop, just the command that you run, meaning that if you have a container running and you run something likeecho "hello"the container will continue running when that finishes
14 [2017-05-11T14:46:28] <brittanyrutherford> why am i not seeing this in windows tray: [<-LINK->]
15 [2017-05-11T14:51:00] <purefan> brittanyrutherford: do you see like an arrow pointing up? maybe its hidden
16 [2017-05-11T14:52:29] <brittanyrutherford> I don't think it's installed with docker toolbox
17 [2017-05-11T14:52:40] <brittanyrutherford> since I used toolbox as am using windows 10 home, not pro
18 [2017-05-11T14:53:04] <brittanyrutherford>  [<-LINK->]
19 [2017-05-11T14:53:30] <brittanyrutherford> also no windows process called Docker
20 [2017-05-11T14:53:46] <brittanyrutherford> yeah, seems it's different
21 [2017-05-11T15:06:46] <brittanyrutherford> ah, I knew it
22 [2017-05-11T15:06:48] <brittanyrutherford> (kidding)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T14:22:27] <brittanyrutherford> what is 1-1 window?
2 [2017-05-11T14:22:40] <brittanyrutherford> elcolie: ooooh, I can help you with that :D haha
3 [2017-05-11T14:22:54] <elcolie> Great!
4 [2017-05-11T14:22:59] <brittanyrutherford> are you on windows?
5 [2017-05-11T14:23:39] <brittanyrutherford> please say yes :(
6 [2017-05-11T14:23:50] <brittanyrutherford> or am out
7 [2017-05-11T14:23:51] <JinnaBalu> hahahhaha
8 [2017-05-11T14:24:09] <JinnaBalu> brittanyrutherford: having fun with docker now.
9 [2017-05-11T14:24:15] <brittanyrutherford> oh yeah
10 [2017-05-11T14:24:20] <brittanyrutherford> am gonna spam containers
11 [2017-05-11T14:24:23] <brittanyrutherford> haha
12 [2017-05-11T14:24:55] <brittanyrutherford> am gonna make a while(true) create containers
13 [2017-05-11T14:25:39] <brittanyrutherford> elcolie: wow .. sorry can't help with that
14 [2017-05-11T14:25:49] <brittanyrutherford> I was about to say: open kitemantics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T17:31:30] <brittanyrutherford> so I guess am gonna stop learning Docker .. all examples on the internet are related to how docker for windows is installed.. which is not even what I have.. I have windows home, which can only have docker toolbox ..
2 [2017-05-11T17:31:57] <brittanyrutherford> i setup a windows enterprise VM on Oracle virtual box
3 [2017-05-11T17:32:20] <brittanyrutherford> but it gave me errors about hyper-v ..
4 [2017-05-11T17:32:42] <brittanyrutherford> so until I get rid of windows home and get an upgraded one.. it won't make sense to get into docker :(
5 [2017-05-11T17:32:53] <brittanyrutherford> thanks all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T17:35:31] <SISheogorath> brittanyrutherford: it maybe would be easier to simply use a DO droplet :D and learn a few bits of GNU/Linux ^^
2 [2017-05-11T17:35:42] <SISheogorath> That's how I work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T17:37:41] <valamorgon> so what is docker anyway? (hope you guys have prize for the person who asked as 100000th time)
2 [2017-05-11T17:38:04] <valamorgon> instead of whole os vm, can I use docker for app? that s the point?
3 [2017-05-11T17:53:03] <brittanyrutherford> valamorgon: as far as I understand, it's a package of 1 or more apps, bundled together
4 [2017-05-11T17:53:25] <brittanyrutherford> it's not a replacement for VM, it's a replacement for the process of searching for app/download/install
5 [2017-05-11T17:54:00] <brittanyrutherford> like the mongoDB container, it comes with powershell/client/server all together, plus some other apps.. all hosted on your original machine
6 [2017-05-11T17:54:36] <brittanyrutherford> that's how I understand it, but not sure
7 [2017-05-11T17:54:51] <brittanyrutherford> SISheogorath: yeah, that would open whole new doors for me am not ready to get into now :(
8 [2017-05-11T21:10:44] <brittanyrutherford> can we package atom/node in the same container and reuse them
9 [2017-05-11T21:36:33] <brittanyrutherford> I mean, containers bundle apps
10 [2017-05-11T21:36:44] <brittanyrutherford> why do we consider node/mongo as apps, but not atom?
11 [2017-05-11T21:36:52] <brittanyrutherford> am still confused and can't understand it 100%
12 [2017-05-11T21:37:19] <brittanyrutherford> I thought maybe I can have some config in atom, and add it to the container, and make it reusable across developers
13 [2017-05-11T21:37:30] <brittanyrutherford> so they don't have to do same config across their editors
14 [2017-05-11T21:37:36] <brittanyrutherford> can't I do that with containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T17:54:58] <JinnaBalu> every process runs on some port, we are running any service isolated in docker container by opening that port to the host machine.
2 [2017-05-11T17:58:42] <JinnaBalu> we install nothing on our machine except the docker. when we run docker container, it uses memory, when we stop them our memory is back, and we can run any image just like that . upgrading the versions becomes easier to run on docker, instead uninstall and install new version on machine.
3 [2017-05-11T18:01:40] <JinnaBalu> When we are dealing with microservices, we may use different databases different  languages , we make all of them run together with docker. as docker can run any database supports any language by means of container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T20:59:52] <SISheogorath> @valamorgoninstead of whole os vm, can I use docker for app? that s the point?Docker Containers are about immutability, minimalism and scale-ability. maybe checkout this answer: https://gitter.im/docker/docker?at=59139a17551ea6485ba83831
2 [2017-05-11T21:22:16] <SISheogorath> not completely sure why you need atom in the container?
3 [2017-05-11T21:22:34] <SISheogorath> In general maybe interesting for you: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-05-11T21:22:56] <SISheogorath> Live debugging a node application inside a docker container ^^ very nice
5 [2017-05-11T21:24:57] <SISheogorath> in general yes, you can get them into the same container ._.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T22:35:22] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: apps are notusuallyfor GUI use (web sites, webapps yes) .. having said notusually, you can of course package "atom" inside the container. but you are mixing up two worlds.the container running your webapp is destined for a web server somewhere.. \nthe container with "atom" bundled in .. is for your desktop, not the webserverso it makes no sense to put atom in the container and send atom to the webserver, where it will never be used.
2 [2017-05-11T22:36:03] <rbuckland> which means .. if youreallywant to have atom and the node webapp docker-ised, then create two containers.
3 [2017-05-11T22:36:23] <rbuckland> running atom "from" the container will prove to be very complex for you.
4 [2017-05-11T22:37:05] <rbuckland> suggestion.install atom locally on your workstation .. \ncreate a docker container for your webapp.
5 [2017-05-11T22:38:43] <rbuckland> brittanyrutherford: to re-distribute youratomconfig across to developers in your team. Just put the atom config ingit(alagithub) .. and share the git repo.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-11T23:08:40] <SISheogorath> Well it's not completely true @rbuckland Containers are use for Desktops, too, but in most cases they are not docker containers. (an example would be Ubuntu Snap apps or AppImages. Same applies to Android Apps which use containers, too.)@brittanyrutherford The idea for the docker containers in speech of development is, that it's created to be reproducible and you eliminate issues with dependency conflicts. A common example is: You have 2 Applications running on your Server: 1 needs Node version 4 and can't run with 6 and another needs Node version 6 and can't run with 4. They maybe have some kind of setup script but you can imagine the conflict that will appear when you try to setup both at the same time on your system. You can run then in 2 VMs but you waste tons of RAM for a VM you only use to test an application and you have to copy your source to the VM, maybe write something inside the VM, test it, break it, have to recover, etc. very annoying. Containers are build like you would build a static bound C program. You define what you need, and docker manages it to install all dependencies, makes sure everything is in place and inside your container environment you have a very minimal and controled setup so if you need node version 4 it's there and you don't depend on the version installed on your system. And of course you can rebuild your software over and over again when you do changes switch forward and backward in your history, switch branches and more. The handling stays very simple.
2 [2017-05-11T23:10:49] <SISheogorath> But this also means that docker containers are not made to develop inside them. So they try to avoid "state" which means any data you might change and want to persist. Docker allows you to use volumes to persist data but it\'s more to make all these container setup that exist really usable. The general idea is too keep containers as Stateless as possible
3 [2017-05-11T23:33:10] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure, but maybe it works with docker-in-docker
4 [2017-05-11T23:33:21] <SISheogorath> in general I wouldn't recommend it
5 [2017-05-12T00:10:28] <SISheogorath> well for mongodb and express/node you have docker/docker-compose (to split it in multiple containers). The thing you don\'t want to "share" is the editor. Reason? Well different people use different editors. And editors are really personal for the most developers. Own shortcuts their very personal list of plugins and tons of different projects. In other words: The editor is on another layer than the project. Because you want to use your editor to edit multiple projects, and not choose the editor based on the project your are about to work with.And as I already mentioned docker is not made for Desktop applications. You can run them in docker with some dirty hacks and work arounds, no problem. But by design docker containers are more build for non-desktop containers.

1 [2017-05-11T23:17:59] <dimberman> Hi guys, potentially stupid question: Is it possible to run minikube inside of a docker container?
2 [2017-05-12T06:11:22] <purefan> elcolie: gotcha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-12T00:05:44] <brittanyrutherford> SISheogorath: @rbucklandbut, some programs are not only server stuff.. for example.. let's say you are hiring 3 devs, instead of asking each of them to have a machine with node installed, with mongodb/express/atom with configs/etc.. why not bundle all of this in a container and devs can pull it? I am not talking about bundling atom with web server for production
2 [2017-05-12T00:06:51] <brittanyrutherford> isn't this a valid scenario?
3 [2017-05-12T00:15:31] <brittanyrutherford> thanks@SISheogorath
4 [2017-05-12T00:15:44] <brittanyrutherford> am a bit confused about this whole thing

1 [2017-05-12T08:03:09] <ygokirmak> Hi guys.. We have a networking problem in docker-swarm. The problem is below;we have virtualized environment over wmware ( vsphere 6.02)\nour servers are created from vmware say server1 and server2\nwe have a docker compose file defining a couple of services\nwe have an overlay-network definition within docker-compose for docker-swarm\nwhen we deploy system using docker-swarm deployment is finished successfully, all containers gets ip from overlay network range.\nBut the problem is if 2 containers (say cnt1 and cnt2) are deployed to different servers they can not ping each other\nI check tcpdump and see that ARP communication is successfull so they know each other mac correctly\nBut when you try to ping to container, ICMP Echo messages are send but are not delivered to second machine..Where should I check, any advices?
2 [2017-05-12T08:14:40] <ygokirmak> purefan: I double checked it and they are in the same subnet. 192.168.20.40 / 192.168.20.100 .. I am trying to check whether there are someone dropping the ICMP or not .. I can check on server level and see..
3 [2017-05-12T08:49:40] <ygokirmak> purefan: I think this is a possible duplicate [<-ISSUE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-12T08:09:20] <purefan> ygokirmak: ARP could be reported from another machine, it doesn't mean that a host can actually reach another one. Assuming that there isn't a configuration dropping ICMP packets can you check that both containers have IPs in the same subnet?

1 [2017-05-12T13:52:56] <tazjin> anyone seen issues with the embedded DNS server used by user-created networks on AWS? It plain and simple won't resolve anything external (not even if --dns is set on the daemon)
2 [2017-05-12T13:53:31] <tazjin> I dug up an old issue somewhere that mentioned that the lib used for the embedded DNS server had issues with Azure's DNS service, so my suspicion is that the AWS DNS server is causing something similar (though that would be strange)

1 [2017-05-12T15:49:08] <morpheyesh> need help! i have a requirement where I need to insert a jar and build a new image. I need to be able to do that from another container which does certain steps. For ex: Container A will have the jar(wont really run it) , but it does other things. Now, one of the step is t ocreate another image with this jar. This image runs the actual jar. Does insert API work?

2 [2017-05-13T01:56:00] <gdeverlant> I was wondering if there is a way in a dockerfile to get the hostname of the parent machine
3 [2017-05-13T01:56:17] <gdeverlant> like my server name is serverdb
4 [2017-05-13T01:56:51] <gdeverlant> in my docker file I would like to pass the name serverdb to an entrypoint
5 [2017-05-13T01:57:13] <gdeverlant> I know of $HOSTNAME but this is the containers hostname

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-13T09:04:32] <indigogoo> gdeverlant: If you’re trying to acces the database server that runs on hostmachine, it would be better to run your database in the container and use docker-compose to set up network easily
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-13T09:56:42] <SISheogorath> nischay30: write a Dockerfile that is based on the cassandra container andCOPYthe config into the container
2 [2017-05-13T14:25:43] <SISheogorath> fthamura: check minfs, iirc there are people using it. I don't know about performance etc. I guess it's slow
3 [2017-05-13T14:26:00] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: use the apache2 binary?
4 [2017-05-13T14:26:40] <SISheogorath> vignesh-kumar19: compile it yourself or use something else. As on any other distro, too
5 [2017-05-13T14:29:33] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: use a build argument. There is no other way. Main reason: your containers should not depend on anything related to the host. If you need any kind of information inside the container: copy it or use a build argument. That's the way to go
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-13T10:11:01] <gdeverlant> indigogo: Lol I just want the parenthostname in the ENV Variables dude why are you giving me another solution?
2 [2017-05-13T17:11:27] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: what is a build argument
3 [2017-05-13T17:11:39] <gdeverlant> I would like to run a docker service in a cluster
4 [2017-05-13T17:11:43] <gdeverlant> and each docker instance
5 [2017-05-13T17:11:54] <gdeverlant> need to have the name of their respective hostname
6 [2017-05-13T17:13:13] <gdeverlant> can I execute in an environment a bash function like hostname ?
7 [2017-05-13T17:14:00] <gdeverlant> like docker run -t --name c1 -e HOSTNAME=(eval hostname) mycontainername/container:3.3.3
8 [2017-05-13T17:17:32] <gdeverlant> ok
9 [2017-05-13T17:17:53] <gdeverlant> the best for me is to use pssh in my 12 nodes
10 [2017-05-13T17:18:34] <gdeverlant> and execute docker create -d --name nameContainer -e HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME test/test
11 [2017-05-13T17:19:29] <SISheogorath> why-efor the hostname? You can use the--hostnameflag
12 [2017-05-13T17:20:15] <SISheogorath> oh I checked back docker-services do support --hostname
13 [2017-05-13T17:20:34] <gdeverlant> when I run docker service create
14 [2017-05-13T17:20:36] <SISheogorath> but then you use the same hostname on every host... maybe not what you wanted
15 [2017-05-13T17:20:42] <gdeverlant> all the nodes get the name of the manager
16 [2017-05-13T17:20:45] <gdeverlant> I don't want that
17 [2017-05-13T17:21:31] <gdeverlant> so doing parallel ssh
18 [2017-05-13T17:21:51] <gdeverlant> and running docker run instead makes more sense
19 [2017-05-13T17:25:51] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: where did you find all the variable names supported ?
20 [2017-05-13T17:26:28] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: The reason why I want to use -e instead of --hostname is because
21 [2017-05-13T17:26:31] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
22 [2017-05-13T17:27:10] <gdeverlant> I have a a service which needs one of its config set with the name of the host
23 [2017-05-13T17:27:17] <gdeverlant> and this has to be unique
24 [2017-05-13T17:28:26] <SISheogorath> how about mounting it somewhere?
25 [2017-05-13T17:33:29] <gdeverlant> what do you mean ?
26 [2017-05-13T17:34:50] <gdeverlant> is there any documentation
27 [2017-05-13T17:34:54] <gdeverlant> for what you call mounting
28 [2017-05-13T18:10:11] <gdeverlant> you mean i share the /etc:/host/etc
29 [2017-05-13T18:10:32] <gdeverlant> and read the hostname file of the host
30 [2017-05-13T18:10:45] <gdeverlant> and then put the value inside of an ENV variable ?
31 [2017-05-13T18:34:57] <gdeverlant> Ohh I found that  TEST=$(grep "" /etc/hostname)
32 [2017-05-13T18:35:12] <gdeverlant> puts the content of the file in the ENV variable TEST
33 [2017-05-13T18:35:37] <gdeverlant> Can this work inside a Dockerfile
34 [2017-05-13T18:36:21] <gdeverlant> RUN PARENT_HOSTNAME=$(grep "" /host/etc/hostname) ?????
35 [2017-05-13T18:37:25] <gdeverlant> RUN export PARENT_HOSTNAME

1 [2017-05-13T13:13:30] <yuvgeek> what's the alternative for/usr/sbin/apachectlfor ubuntu 14.04 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-13T17:16:10] <SISheogorath> you can maybe use docker templates to add the hostname but it doesn't sound useful, as I'm not sure if that is even possible in environment variables and if it's possible if you can get a nodes name
2 [2017-05-13T17:17:09] <SISheogorath> in general you can't simply access the hostname of the machine you're running on and what ever you try to inject is executed during the command you use to create the service and not during the creation of the container. (At least if you talk about docker swarm-mode)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-13T17:48:46] <SISheogorath> sure ._. host mounts? simply pass-v /some/path/on/host:/some/path/inside/the/containerto your container. Or in case ofdocker service createit\'s-v type="bind",source="/path/on/host",target="/path/in/container"
2 [2017-05-13T17:51:29] <SISheogorath> for example: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-05-13T17:51:37] <SISheogorath> you can do this with directories as well
4 [2017-05-13T19:06:29] <SISheogorath> That's not how it works ._.
5 [2017-05-13T19:07:47] <SISheogorath> everyRUNstatement during build is executed INSIDE a container based on the image of the previous build step
6 [2017-05-13T19:09:03] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: I'm not really sure what you are about to do. Maybe you can explain why you need it. Maybe it's simply a wrong design of the application ._. or you can work around the issue
7 [2017-05-14T13:36:21] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: search forapachebinary and start it.apachectlis just a wrapper script
8 [2017-05-14T14:17:08] <SISheogorath> YuvarajMe: apache2 has a special parameter to run in foreground. (Iirc it's-n)
9 [2017-05-14T14:18:43] <SISheogorath> morpheyesh: it's name host- or bind-mount and you can do it usingdocker run -v /some/path/on/host:/some/path/inside/the/container imagename

8 [2017-05-15T08:28:57] <jeserkin> And one last thing.
9 [2017-05-15T08:30:14] <jeserkin> If one docker-compose file, that has multiple services in it references multiple docker-compose files through those services, then how isservicecontainer name formed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-15T07:00:05] <jeserkin> Good morning everyone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-15T07:01:38] <jeserkin> Guys, what is the easiest way to share database container with other containers, that require it? Examples are welcomed.
2 [2017-05-15T07:40:43] <jeserkin> purefan: sry, forgot to mention, that I am interested in docker-compose setup, not plain dokerfiles. I did try withdepends_on:option.
3 [2017-05-15T07:40:54] <jeserkin> I know, that there is alinkoption.

1 [2017-05-15T09:46:23] <falloutghost> hey, i'm having troubles connecting to amysqldatabase running inside a docker container through anode.js/sequelizeapplication
2 [2017-05-15T09:46:32] <falloutghost> connecting viamysql-clientworks fine
3 [2017-05-15T09:47:08] <falloutghost> when trying to connect viasequelizethough i always receive anER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR: Access denied for user 'root'@'172.17.0.1' (using password: YES)error
4 [2017-05-15T09:48:27] <falloutghost> container was started like this: [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-05-15T09:48:29] <falloutghost> any ideas?
6 [2017-05-15T10:19:31] <falloutghost> root (root@'%'androot@localhost) has all privileges on*.*andapp.*
7 [2017-05-15T10:27:13] <falloutghost> yep
8 [2017-05-15T10:27:35] <falloutghost> also copied it from sequelize config and pasted it intomysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1command to verify
9 [2017-05-15T10:28:54] <pjetr> I'm an absolute beginner, so that's actually as far as my knowledge goes xD
10 [2017-05-15T10:29:40] <falloutghost> i'mguessingit's a privileges problem since the host name in the error message doesn't match the host i'm originally connecting from (localhost), but then again that's only the host machine for the container image.172.17.0.1is the default docker address, but the container is actually running on172.17.0.2-- however, connecting to the latter still throws the same error
11 [2017-05-15T10:30:08] <pjetr> I'm using docker-compose to create and link my apps, which works very easily...
12 [2017-05-15T10:30:40] <pjetr> are they both on the same network?
13 [2017-05-15T10:30:46] <falloutghost> both on the same machine
14 [2017-05-15T10:30:52] <falloutghost> so yes ;)
15 [2017-05-15T10:31:37] <falloutghost> adding--net=hostmakes the error message use127.0.0.1(or localhost) instead of172.17.0.1, but it's still the same issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-15T10:21:40] <pjetr> and as a "is it plugged in" question, have you checked if sequelize uses the correct password?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-15T11:52:56] <frederikprijck> Hi guys, I have setup a docker container using docker-compose. It works perfect on OSX (and I guess on Windows 10, but I have to double check that later). However, I can't get nginx to work on Docker Toolbox for Windows 8.1. Any idea what has to be done different ? (Code available at [<-LINK->] )
2 [2017-05-15T11:53:21] <frederikprijck> I'm guessing it's related to the fact that I have the code running on myDdrive, which isn't shared by default in docker ?
3 [2017-05-15T11:53:42] <frederikprijck> Docker for windows (on win 10) has the option to addDas a shared drive. How do we handle this with Docker Toolbox on Windows 8 ? Preferably I'd like my docker code to be self-contained, and avoid manual actions to be taken (like sharing the folder in VirtualBox / Docker).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-15T18:39:19] <SISheogorath> falloutghost: you use docker-compose to setup? you should connect to the service name you gave your database (or by commandline you usedapp-mysqlas name in your run statement). Not127.0.0.1or172.17.0.1. Also you should use the username you set asMYSQL_USERnotroot. And then it'll work.
2 [2017-05-15T18:39:57] <SISheogorath> And also you should try to avoid exposing the database ports to the public

1 [2017-05-16T04:40:49] <ginjo> Hi all, I've been using the binaries at [<-LINK->] to test our services with the very latest fixes. However with the recent shift to Moby, I'm at a loss as to where these binaries are now located. The builds at the above mentioned site appear to be frozen as of May 12. Any guidance appreciated - thanks!

1 [2017-05-16T08:05:42] <veris-neerajdhiman> I am setting up postgres using docker but when I am doing docker-compose up (after build) database is not created for that container [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-05-16T08:25:11] <veris-neerajdhiman> purefan: no
3 [2017-05-16T08:26:37] <veris-neerajdhiman> purefan: but If I ran docker-compose run templates_db , then db is successfully created
4 [2017-05-16T08:43:50] <veris-neerajdhiman> Issue resolved , It was permission error as soon as I mentioned complete path here [<-CODE->] Issue was fixed
5 [2017-05-16T13:43:33] <veris-neerajdhiman> Hi,I have an app which uses a git fork package. [<-CODE->] But when I tried setup my project with Docker, package is installed from requirement file but when i ran my container , I got got an error that -  ImportError: No module named 'my-pkg'
6 [2017-05-16T13:44:11] <veris-neerajdhiman> its may be beacuse pkg installed from git fork doesn't got to site-packages ?
7 [2017-05-16T13:44:23] <veris-neerajdhiman> so any solution ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-16T08:15:01] <purefan> veris-neerajdhiman: did you get an error?

1 [2017-05-16T10:06:04] <CrashyBang> Hey folks I am having an absolute nightmare of a time linking/waiting for containers with docker-compose, I have posted a detailed description on stack overflow [<-LINK->] if any of you could take a look that would be highly appreciated
2 [2017-05-16T10:35:27] <CrashyBang> Hey@purefanpsqlis installed on the postgres container by default and I can use it by connecting to it.
3 [2017-05-16T10:37:04] <purefan> CrashyBang: but you're running psql in the filewait-for-postgres.shwhich is in theservicecontainer, not thedatabasecontainer
4 [2017-05-16T10:37:49] <CrashyBang> Hey@purefanyes but the two containers should be connected? Or am I misunderstanding how that works?
5 [2017-05-16T10:40:10] <purefan> CrashyBang: They can be connected via network but as per your definition they are not sharing the same volume, so files in one container cannot directly be read from the other container. Try to connect to yourservicecontainer and manually run the filewait-for-postgres.shthen try to install psql and run the file again
6 [2017-05-16T10:41:33] <CrashyBang> Ahhh I see, man that is a pain! thank you though!
7 [2017-05-16T10:43:27] <purefan> CrashyBang: no problem :) if you're on ubuntu/debian you can just add this line to your wait-for-postgres.sh file:sudo apt-get install postgresql-clientit will not install the entire database, only the client tools
8 [2017-05-16T10:43:58] <CrashyBang> Yeah that is what I have landed on :) thank you!
9 [2017-05-16T10:50:31] <purefan> :)
10 [2017-05-16T12:18:35] <CrashyBang> purefan: could I get you to take a look at this: [<-LINK->] if you have time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-16T10:08:34] <purefan> CrashyBang: First thing I see isserver_1    | ./setup/wait-for-postgres.sh: line 10: psql: command not foundhave you tried installing psql?
2 [2017-05-17T06:13:28] <purefan> realisation: what dont you understand?

1 [2017-05-17T08:07:11] <dasheck0> Hi I have an issue with docker-compose and pre-existing networks. Is there anyone here who can help me with that?
2 [2017-05-17T08:07:19] <dasheck0> Sorry for that "rude" introduction :O
3 [2017-05-17T08:10:25] <dasheck0> Alright. So I have a docker compose, which defines a network, where several containers are running in. This is just fine. On the host machine, where the docker-compose file is executed there is already a network available defined in the host machines /etc/hosts file (let\'s call it "ext_db"). So within the docker container a server is running, which tries to connect to the database available on "ext_db"
4 [2017-05-17T08:10:44] <dasheck0> But I get a host not found error from the ORM telling me that ext_db is not found
5 [2017-05-17T08:11:07] <dasheck0> I also have [<-CODE->] in my compose file
6 [2017-05-17T10:25:15] <dasheck0> We got support from our hosting provider where the container is running on
7 [2017-05-17T10:25:38] <dasheck0> The solution was pretty easy to be honest. We had to set the network_mode to bridge and that's it
8 [2017-05-17T10:25:48] <dasheck0> thanks for the help anyway
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T08:08:32] <purefan> dasheck0: its fine to [<-LINK->] , whats the problem you're having?
2 [2017-05-17T08:34:21] <purefan> isext_dblocalhoston the host machine or is it pointing to an external IP (not another docker container)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T10:27:58] <KellySheffield> I'm running into a 'operation not permitted error Cannot create FIFO .../erlang.pipe.1.r for writing' when to trying to 'start' an app(basic starter phoenix/elixir project) This is all I can find so far googling: [<-ISSUE->] but I'm using docker for windows. Any ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T11:05:08] <gdeverlant> what is the easiest way for me to get the informations of the running container from go code ?
2 [2017-05-17T11:05:32] <gdeverlant> let's say I have an app running inside of a docker container
3 [2017-05-17T11:05:47] <gdeverlant> that app wants to retrieve all the infos of the current container
4 [2017-05-17T12:01:02] <gdeverlant> like the name of the running image
5 [2017-05-17T12:01:15] <gdeverlant> the details about -volumes -env variables
6 [2017-05-17T12:01:47] <gdeverlant> validate if the app is running inside of a docker container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T11:14:08] <purefan> that app wants to retrieve all the infos of the current containerwhat do you mean "all the infos" ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T12:42:36] <SISheogorath> You can check for the /.dockerenv file and maybe check some typical symptoms of an docker container. But you won't see all the details as long as you don't talk to the docker engine API and even there, if you run inside swarm, you won't see all information if you connect to the API of a worker node.
2 [2017-05-17T12:44:24] <SISheogorath> In general you shouldn't care about the fact that you're running inside a container. If you want to warn your users that no volume exists, check for a mountpoint.
3 [2017-05-17T12:44:54] <SISheogorath> I'm sure there is a lib that already checks forinDocker()
4 [2017-05-17T12:45:19] <SISheogorath> At least there is a lib in NodeJS
5 [2017-05-17T19:19:07] <SISheogorath> iglov: i would suggest to file an issue (or check if there already is one)
6 [2017-05-18T10:59:01] <SISheogorath> albertjt: it'll run in background with-dbut your commanddocker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhellohas no-d:D
7 [2017-05-18T18:40:29] <SISheogorath> it's just a guess but maybe you need to add mount options behind your mount:docker run -it -v hello:/world:options jenkinsci/blueocean ash
8 [2017-05-18T18:40:46] <SISheogorath> replace options with real mount options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-17T14:25:57] <iglov> Hi there! I have question about docker and iptables. I my current config, i use iptables=false, but if i create any network with compose - docker don't create NAT rules and masquerading, and my containers can't reach the internet. If i use iptables=true, besides NAT rules docker adds accept rules for any to ports which i exposed. For example, if i saydocker run -p 80:80 -d nginx- docker accept connection from ANY to  port 80 . Maybe i can somehow say docker, what i want create container in new bridge with NAT/MASQUERADING , but i want self create rule ip iptables for exposed ports?
2 [2017-05-17T14:27:19] <iglov> --iptables=half-false maybe 8D

1 [2017-05-18T02:01:42] <fanux> What is the difference between volume typebindandvolume?```

3 [2017-05-18T02:03:13] <fanux> Has some docs for volume Type?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T05:28:19] <wenjianhn> iglov: In 17.06, which will be released soon, you can add your own rules. See [<-ISSUE->] .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T10:11:34] <albertjt> Just started learning docker and have some question to ask, I am using git bash on windows and currently following the guide on docs.docker.com. When I started running "docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello" it seems that even though I quit the process, it still runs in the background when I list running process using docker ps. Why is that? Doesn\'t it supposed to run in the background if I use the -d command?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T12:50:33] <bpt6576> I randocker volume create --name hello --opt o=uid=1000,gid=1000and can see the volume withdocker volume inspect hello, however when I try to mount the namedhellovolume into a container usingdocker run -it -v hello:/world jenkinsci/blueocean ashI geterror while mounting volume '/var/lib/docker/volumes/hello/_data': missing device in volume optionsAm I missing something in mydocker runcommand? Any clarity/suggestions appreciated.

1 [2017-05-18T19:46:47] <gdeverlant> Hi guy
2 [2017-05-18T19:47:06] <gdeverlant> I would like to know why does docker not find a plugin that I'm trying to run
3 [2017-05-18T19:47:20] <gdeverlant> it is a volume persistence plugin
4 [2017-05-18T19:47:38] <gdeverlant> how can I know that docker recognize a running plugin process
5 [2017-05-18T19:50:23] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: do you talk about a v1 or a v2 plugin?
6 [2017-05-18T19:51:32] <SISheogorath> for a v2 plugin you can rundocker plugin lsfor a v1 plugin I think (can really say) the easiest way is to check the docker log
7 [2017-05-18T19:59:40] <gdeverlant> legacy plugins
8 [2017-05-18T20:00:48] <gdeverlant> this is the plugin
9 [2017-05-18T20:00:58] <gdeverlant> It is only available for amd64
10 [2017-05-18T20:01:07] <gdeverlant> but since it is written in go
11 [2017-05-18T20:01:31] <gdeverlant> I've compiled it on arm64(aarch64)
12 [2017-05-18T20:01:38] <gdeverlant>  [<-LINK->]
13 [2017-05-18T20:03:11] <gdeverlant> I have found it on [<-LINK->]
14 [2017-05-18T20:03:43] <gdeverlant> my docker is [<-CODE->]
15 [2017-05-18T20:19:11] <SISheogorath> sandys: I'm not sure. I couldn't find a nice solution for that. The only way I found was to put the reference into the build process as argument and if you clone the repository inside your container, to usegit clone -b $REF --depth 1 https://hostname/repo
16 [2017-05-18T20:22:09] <sandys> SISheogorath: hmm... thanks for helping out though :(
17 [2017-05-18T20:23:52] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: check if there is a.jsonor.specfile in/usr/lib/docker/pluginsor a.sockin/run/docker/plugins

19 [2017-05-18T20:24:14] <SISheogorath> sandys: you're welcome
20 [2017-05-18T20:26:28] <gdeverlant> actually
21 [2017-05-18T20:26:40] <gdeverlant> there is one on the AMD64 server
22 [2017-05-18T20:27:01] <gdeverlant> but there is no file on the ARM64
23 [2017-05-18T20:27:16] <SISheogorath> there is your problem :)
24 [2017-05-18T20:27:25] <gdeverlant> the plugin seems to run in htop
25 [2017-05-18T20:28:08] <gdeverlant> do you know why it is not created on the ARM64
26 [2017-05-18T20:28:17] <gdeverlant> but runs well on the AMD64
27 [2017-05-18T20:28:52] <gdeverlant> does it have to do with the version of docker ?
28 [2017-05-18T20:29:16] <gdeverlant> on the AMD64 docker version is [<-CODE->]
29 [2017-05-18T20:29:48] <gdeverlant> on the ARM64 docker version [<-CODE->]
30 [2017-05-18T20:38:54] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: Do you have an idea ??? is it simple like folder permissions ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T19:53:48] <sandys> this does not work from within a dockerfile, what should I be doing ? I'm trying to add a label from inside the dockerfile .
2 [2017-05-18T19:53:50] <sandys> LABEL GIT_REF="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T19:58:01] <SISheogorath> I'm pretty sure that you can't use$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)inside a LABEL tag. Reason: It doesn't run inside the container context, it only add Metadata to the image manifest (don't quote on me, but that was the conclusion I came to, when I thought about doing it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T20:14:53] <sandys> SISheogorath: hmm.. actually i cant run the command itself but i can assign any label inside the image. that's the issue - is there any way to assign a label from the result of a command ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T20:33:14] <electriccode> I need to run certain cronjob inside docker image php:7.1-apache and the cronjob depends on lots of environment variables, should I create a .env, define all env variables there and source it in Dockerfile? I can then again source it in my cronjob as well. Is this a good practice?
2 [2017-05-19T03:25:04] <electriccode> SISheogorath:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-05-19T03:25:33] <electriccode> its a laravel application as you can see
4 [2017-05-19T18:47:58] <electriccode> SISheogorath: yes thanks for the tip, I am using cron service in my entrypoint as I am using debian.
5 [2017-05-19T18:48:40] <electriccode>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-05-19T18:48:49] <electriccode> this is how my entrypoint looks like
7 [2017-05-19T18:49:10] <electriccode> so crontab runs in its own shell and larval uses values inside.env
8 [2017-05-19T18:49:44] <electriccode> some of the values likeDB_HOSTandMAIL_HOSTare overriden byDockerfile
9 [2017-05-19T18:50:30] <electriccode> And cron doesn't have any access to env variables set by either docker or laravel
10 [2017-05-19T18:50:36] <electriccode> hence line 1 and 2
11 [2017-05-19T18:51:15] <electriccode> in line 1.envgets me laravel enviers, and in line 2printenvgets me docker env variables
12 [2017-05-19T18:51:41] <electriccode> and crontab can only access variable inside/etc/environment
13 [2017-05-19T18:51:46] <electriccode> its very strange :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-18T20:45:31] <SISheogorath> electriccode: how did you create the cronjobs?
2 [2017-05-18T20:46:31] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: maybe you can ask in their gitter chatroom (if you didn't already)
3 [2017-05-18T20:49:59] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: I found the problem
4 [2017-05-18T20:50:11] <gdeverlant> the plugin was creating the .sock file
5 [2017-05-18T20:50:26] <gdeverlant> but it was not creating its own name local-persist.sock
6 [2017-05-18T20:50:34] <gdeverlant> but instead it was root.sock
7 [2017-05-18T20:50:37] <gdeverlant> why is that ?
8 [2017-05-18T20:50:59] <gdeverlant> it is runned via systemd this plugin

1 [2017-05-19T12:17:18] <brunomilani> Hi everybody :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T12:20:48] <gadget_mnky_twitter> Hello
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T15:58:22] <JinnaBalu> Hoi all, run scala application with docker, any one have the sample repo, simple hello work scala file run on docker container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T16:43:58] <fthamura> i try to expose docker (-H 0.0.0.0:4243), in centos
2 [2017-05-19T16:44:07] <fthamura> but i cannot access from outside,
3 [2017-05-19T16:44:11] <fthamura> is SELinux default block it?
4 [2017-05-19T16:44:18] <fthamura> any idea to open and test the port?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T20:23:13] <SISheogorath> fthamura: simply run curl against it. Also check if the port is listed in the output ofnetstat -ln. Last but not least check that your firewall isn't blocking
2 [2017-05-19T20:26:55] <SISheogorath> electriccode: what kind of tasks do you run there?
3 [2017-05-19T22:47:20] <SISheogorath> chkm8: thedocker loadreference says it's loaded with the tags you exported it [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-05-19T22:47:48] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: yes, for round about 1 hour
5 [2017-05-19T22:49:00] <SISheogorath> cbeach: what do you mean by wiped out? the whole iptables rules? When does it happen? And hint:docker-composeitself never touches iptables
6 [2017-05-19T22:53:47] <SISheogorath> does it happen on firstdocker-compose upor on everydocker-compose up? or does it happen when you rundocker-compose down?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T20:27:48] <electriccode> Read some API and update DB, and also send mails periodically based on that data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T20:51:54] <SISheogorath> You can maybe checkout the indiehoster setups. They build a very crazy way of a cron container for example for nextcloud, but it works fine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T21:49:00] <chkm8> hi everyone, can we now name an image that is loaded from local path? Everytime I do docker load image <image_path.tar> would name your image to <none>, I dont want to tag it after save specially if you have plenty of images I cant find a hack for this. Any inputs would be appreciate! thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T22:03:04] <cbeach> I'm having trouble with docker-compose and iptables. Something keeps wiping out our iptables, and we can't figure out what/why. Everything pretty much goes to hell when this happens.  We'd love to use a static iptalbe, but there's no guarantee that our exposed container is going to be reachable at the same ip/interface/bridge/what-have-you.
2 [2017-05-19T22:04:50] <cbeach> How can we fix this? I've played around with creating another bridge, but I can't seem to change it's name on the system. It's dynamically generated and has the formbr-26a6c5ff90b7as listed byifconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T22:44:59] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: Are you there buddy ?
2 [2017-05-19T22:45:09] <gdeverlant> I'm having a problem again
3 [2017-05-19T23:17:09] <gdeverlant> cool
4 [2017-05-19T23:17:26] <gdeverlant> I was able to install the plugin
5 [2017-05-19T23:17:32] <gdeverlant> and create volumes locally
6 [2017-05-19T23:17:47] <gdeverlant> without a problem
7 [2017-05-19T23:17:56] <gdeverlant> the plugin is installed on the 10 nodes
8 [2017-05-19T23:19:35] <gdeverlant> the problem is in swarm mode
9 [2017-05-19T23:19:43] <gdeverlant> and docker stack deploy
10 [2017-05-19T23:19:51] <gdeverlant> with yaml file
11 [2017-05-19T23:19:59] <gdeverlant> the shit doesn't work men
12 [2017-05-19T23:22:26] <gdeverlant> this is the yaml [<-CODE->]
13 [2017-05-19T23:24:14] <gdeverlant> the service freeze in pending mode
14 [2017-05-19T23:24:24] <gdeverlant> and don't do anything
15 [2017-05-20T02:27:09] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: It worksss superb thanx for your time
16 [2017-05-20T02:27:31] <gdeverlant> your help was good
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T22:52:00] <cbeach> The docker daemon is setting up a bunch of rules that docker-compose is using for isolation/communication. We're not surewhatis doing it, but yes, something is completely wiping out iptables and breaking our services.
2 [2017-05-19T23:22:37] <cbeach> docker-compose up does actually touch the iptables, as cycling docker-compose fixes the problem.
3 [2017-05-19T23:23:05] <cbeach> I think wemighthave gotten it fixed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-19T23:20:38] <SISheogorath> what exactly does not work? how did create the volume and what is the error message?
2 [2017-05-20T09:42:48] <SISheogorath> I didn't do anything but when it helped, you're welcome :)
3 [2017-05-20T10:53:12] <SISheogorath> @ketchupmonkey if someone infiltrates the application you can have a look at the mounts. The mount points are bind mounts. Yes, there are security problems with bind mounts for example one is describe here: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/04/4 BUT for example this attack needs to setup an own namespace and also to create mountpoints. Docker prevents this by dropping these capabilities. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-05-22T00:00:18] <SISheogorath> jitendradrona: There are a bunch of tutorials at [<-LINK->] . You can also checkout [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-20T10:36:06] <ketchupmonkey> Hi everyone I have a question about the security of docker. I have read it's features of isolation of namespaces and etc. but what bothers me is  in a scenario that someone infiltrates the application that is running on docker and depending on how you are running docker you mount a directory to the host machine doesn't that give the attacker opportunity to go to the host machine? and another thing that  is bothering is since docker is run as root isn't that a lot scarier that the attacker can get root in the host machine?
2 [2017-05-20T11:10:00] <ketchupmonkey> SISheogorath: Thanks! I really appreciate the information. I'm trying to endorse it to a few people who are kind paranoid when it comes to security but aren't really up to date on new technologies so knowing the pros and cons of using docker is a big plus. Thanks again for the info.
3 [2017-05-20T11:12:40] <SISheogorath> you're welcome :D
4 [2017-05-20T11:13:40] <SISheogorath> Hint: If the attackers manage it to escape namespaces you have way bigger problems than an application running as root ;D
5 [2017-05-20T11:21:00] <SISheogorath> If you want to go deeper into this (most of those security features are not docker specific) I can suggest you reading: [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-05-20T11:22:05] <ketchupmonkey> haha yeah that is true
7 [2017-05-20T11:22:50] <ketchupmonkey> oh cool. so far I'm just reading Docker's documentation but I think it is always best to check out other resources to confirm it
8 [2017-05-20T11:22:58] <ketchupmonkey> Thanks for the link

1 [2017-05-21T20:47:14] <banduk> Guys, I believe its a pretty beginner's problem.I cannot ping my host from a container. Is it normal?I remember to do that before by simply ping my host external IP. But for some reason I can't do that now.Could anyone help me?
2 [2017-05-21T20:48:35] <banduk> BTW, I'm on mac, Version 17.03.1-ce-mac12 (17661), channel: stable
3 [2017-05-21T20:55:12] <banduk> Well, updating to edge fixed it. Maybe its because I uninstalled the old version. Could I have any config that could cause the problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-21T21:18:01] <jitendradrona> Hey, can someone help me with contanerizing an app, any link to the tutorial or anything, for example like a web farm or apache or any application as such
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-22T02:35:58] <siassaj> once hi hi
2 [2017-05-22T02:36:09] <siassaj> once? anyway
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-22T02:37:38] <siassaj> So, i'm building my docker images in a way that I've not seen recommended/taught. It seemed very difficult to do all of this with just a Dockerfile so there's a script; Does this approach make any sense or have I overcomplicated it?
2 [2017-05-22T02:37:47] <siassaj>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-05-22T02:40:59] <siassaj> in essence, build.sh takes a bunch of caches that I copied out of the previous image, tars them and shoves them into a build directory. Then it runs docker build in that directory; docker pulls the tarballs in, continues the build process (which is now much faster since the build tools understand that lots of modules already exist, such as my node_modules) and once the images is built, it copies those caches back out
4 [2017-05-22T02:41:15] <siassaj> Sensible or this donkey is an ass?
5 [2017-05-22T02:42:04] <siassaj> Actually, nvm i just saw the rules what this chat is intended for; I'll head off to freenode
6 [2017-05-22T02:47:20] <SISheogorath> The chat is used for everything but I only talked a few times about development :D
7 [2017-05-22T02:48:22] <SISheogorath> In general I would say it's weird to do that ._.  you should take a look at the new multi-staged builds in 17.05
8 [2017-05-22T02:49:36] <SISheogorath> It would call your way to build the things overcomplicated. And you create a lot of overhead to your container. There is a lot you can optimize :)
9 [2017-05-22T03:12:26] <siassaj> SISheogorath: even more confusing is this line: FROM [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-05-22T03:12:53] <siassaj> It appears that I'm using my previous image to build my next one, and so one. Unless I'm mistaken, this is going to cause a huge graph of layers isn't it?
11 [2017-05-22T03:13:22] <siassaj> (I wrote this stuff 6 months ago ... something felt wrong so i moved onto other work)
12 [2017-05-22T03:14:14] <siassaj> " To write a really efficient Dockerfile, you have traditionally needed to employ shell tricks and other logic to keep the layers as small as possible and to ensure that each layer has the artifacts it needs from the previous layer and nothing else."
13 [2017-05-22T03:14:27] <siassaj> that statement confirms my feelings about docker files (before multi stage builds)
14 [2017-05-22T03:17:31] <siassaj> SISheogorath: yeah multi stage makes more sense to me. I don't think it does anything to help with caching stuff between builds (for different app versions, for example caching node_modules between v1.55.1 and 1.55.2 of my app)
15 [2017-05-22T03:18:01] <siassaj> this FROM [<-LINK->] is causing me a lot of worry
16 [2017-05-22T03:42:01] <siassaj> nevermind, I'm wrong and dumb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-22T08:16:50] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: I'm having problems again wth docker swarm and docker stack deploy
2 [2017-05-22T08:17:06] <gdeverlant> 2/3 of the yaml gets deployed
3 [2017-05-22T08:17:17] <gdeverlant> the last part freeze on pending
4 [2017-05-22T08:28:12] <gdeverlant> it seems that docker swarm recogizes labels for 2 servers
5 [2017-05-22T08:28:23] <gdeverlant> and cannot find the labels for the last server
6 [2017-05-22T17:46:34] <gdeverlant> im back let me check
7 [2017-05-22T17:46:45] <gdeverlant> before i had 17-03 version from docker
8 [2017-05-22T17:46:52] <gdeverlant> and I updated all nodes to 15-05
9 [2017-05-22T17:46:56] <gdeverlant> 17-05
10 [2017-05-22T18:01:34] <gdeverlant> I think you are wrong stating that docker stack deploy doesn't care about placements on docker nodes
11 [2017-05-22T18:01:44] <gdeverlant> before I upgrade my docker
12 [2017-05-22T18:01:57] <gdeverlant> this was working with the placement without any problem
13 [2017-05-22T18:03:03] <gdeverlant> My labels are on nodes not on containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-22T11:00:04] <SISheogorath> Can you see the labels on docker node ls? And can you share your yaml file because in generaldocker stack deployis designed to create the services and don't care about placement of the containers
2 [2017-05-22T17:10:11] <jitendradrona> SISheogorath: Thanks.
3 [2017-05-23T02:26:06] <SISheogorath> jorandradefig: If you haven't mounted the filesystem into the cotnainer and didn't rebuild it, it's not going to change anything
4 [2017-05-23T02:26:26] <SISheogorath> You have to rebuild you container, stop the old one and run a new one with the new image
5 [2017-05-23T02:28:19] <SISheogorath> Container images are immutable. So you have to inject your sources into the container or rebuild the image and start the new one
6 [2017-05-23T02:45:19] <SISheogorath> ssnyder:  [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-05-23T02:46:34] <SISheogorath> In general it's setup your application by a few shell scripts and act like your database and APIs are not located on the same server
8 [2017-05-23T02:46:38] <SISheogorath> That's it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-22T20:24:28] <jorandradefig> Hi guys
2 [2017-05-22T20:24:45] <jorandradefig> I ran a container like this:
3 [2017-05-22T20:24:58] <jorandradefig>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-05-22T20:25:05] <jorandradefig> It's an angular app
5 [2017-05-22T20:25:09] <jorandradefig> I made changes to the source code
6 [2017-05-22T20:25:20] <jorandradefig> How can I see the changes in the container
7 [2017-05-22T20:25:41] <jorandradefig> The container shows the past state

1 [2017-05-23T02:32:37] <ssnyder> total newbie here...need to get an existing Ruby on Rails app dockerized for development purposes (from a Windows box).  Figured it might be easiest to start with the MySQL db, but not sure. Anyone have a pointer to a good tutorial/example for dealing with legacy apps?  I've run through the Code School free Docker course.  It was helpful, but how to do what I want is a few steps beyond.
2 [2017-05-23T02:51:01] <ssnyder> Thanks@Sheogorath....also I'm on Windows 10 (new machine) - installed Docker, and even though I've been running the tutorials, etc. all of a sudden it says that I may not be running in an elevated client - or that the docker daemon is not running - both of which I know are false because I had just been using it!  Is there any reason why it is so flaky?
3 [2017-05-23T13:09:31] <ssnyder> SISheogorath: I am currently running docker for windows - should I go back and install docker toolbox instead?  (I'm not sure if it is HyperV or Docker that is causing the flakiness). I used to use Vagrant/Virtualbox but it was a bit heavy weight (which is why I am trying to switch to Docker containers).  Unfortunately I am stuck with Windows 10 as my host OS.
4 [2017-05-23T13:34:15] <SISheogorath> Docker for Windows is fine if you use Windows 10 Pro or higher
5 [2017-05-23T13:35:06] <SISheogorath> sushant91265_twitter: how would you do it ouside of compose?
6 [2017-05-23T14:26:14] <ssnyder> I am using Windows 10 Enterprise, so that should suffice.  I'll reboot, maybe that will help remove some of the flakiness I was seeing last night
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-23T04:17:17] <jorandradefig> SISheogorath: And how I inject the sources in the container? By rebuilding the image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-23T09:45:27] <SISheogorath> jorandradefig: read about volumes. There are many people out there writing blog posts about how to develop with docker and explain how to inject the sroucecode by volume
2 [2017-05-23T09:46:18] <SISheogorath> ssnyder: check the moby VM which runs in background
3 [2017-05-23T09:47:05] <SISheogorath> If you run docker for Windows it is in HyperV. If you run docker toolbox it is iirc in Virtualbox
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-23T10:17:38] <yuriy-yarosh> I'm getting strange error on Alpine withsha256sumunknown option quiet...Although Ubuntu'ssha256sumhas it and they're both using the samecoreutils

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-23T10:24:24] <SISheogorath> They are not using the same coreutils. Ubuntu runs a patched version while Alpine runs the default busybox ones

1 [2017-05-24T10:00:13] <ersagun> Hi everyone, I'm a user of docker-compose on windows with docker-machine. I have multiple container, each one a  spring micro service. My question is about the excessive memory usage of docker-compose on the current version. When I launch my containers separated, I use less memory then when I launch with docker-compose. Does anybody know why on this version memory is anormally used more on docker-machine ? thanks for you help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-24T10:33:15] <sushant91265_twitter> diegoxro: do you have any reference for this ? I'm not able to.

1 [2017-05-24T11:14:16] <fthamura> hi all
2 [2017-05-24T11:14:31] <fthamura> we try docker-machine to an esx server, and we got that when we restart, all the volume gone
3 [2017-05-24T11:14:52] <fthamura> we use docker-compose to make volume, can help guys?
4 [2017-05-24T11:15:53] <fthamura> how to make persistance volume in docker-machine?

3 [2017-05-24T18:28:37] <gdeverlant> I would like to implement a specific feature

1 [2017-05-24T18:57:26] <matrixbot> Rahulkrishnan(rark)How can we attach iscsi volume in Docker containers
2 [2017-05-25T01:10:28] <matrixbot> Rahulkrishnan(rark)Sheogorath (Gitter): I searched for volume driver for docker for iscsi but could get any info related with it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-24T21:32:35] <SISheogorath> Rahulkrishnan(rark), if you want to use iscsi volumes as  docker volumes you have to search for a volume driver that supports it, or mount them locally and use the bind driver. I don't recommend using the bind driver for production because it maybe has bad performance.
2 [2017-05-25T12:04:00] <SISheogorath> I think there are storage drivers using iscsi but only from proprietary storage providers/vendors. So probably you have to write an own plugin
3 [2017-05-25T13:25:49] <SISheogorath> Westen0x: is that inside your container or outside in some docker directory?
4 [2017-05-25T13:35:00] <SISheogorath>   No problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-25T16:46:05] <iglov> i have question about diskspace in swarm mode. Imagine that i have 2 phisical servers (node1 and node2) and i create docker swarm on it with 2 managers. And then i create service with mount any directory, for ex.docker service create --mount type=bind,src=/var/www,dst=/var/www,readonly --name nginx --publish 80:80 nginx. Question: How i must sync /var/www between node1 and node2 ?
2 [2017-05-26T10:38:11] <iglov> ok, thx, i see now. I thought docker has default solution for this issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-25T17:49:30] <SISheogorath> Well how you sync these directory is up to you. Some people actually use something like rsync in a cronjob, others run drdb I personally like to use glusterfs, but on a 3 node cluster (hint: you can't run swarmmodr on only 2 nodes, without loose the entire cluster when one manager goes down)
2 [2017-05-26T09:09:02] <SISheogorath> This image doesn't look really useful to me. It runs the entire cluster on the same machine >.> What's the point of that?

2 [2017-05-26T01:24:05] <megamindbrian> The computer it works on docker-machine doesn't list anything, I assume docker-machine doesn't work on Hyper-V still?

1 [2017-05-28T13:56:31] <lukaskroepfl> hi guys just a quick question. I am building a image from alpine and copying a binary to/main, inentrypoint.shI am executing main withexec /mainbut getting the error/entrypoint.sh: exec: line 8: ./main: not found
2 [2017-05-28T13:56:42] <lukaskroepfl> anybody an idea what is going on here? :D
3 [2017-05-28T13:57:30] <lukaskroepfl> funny thing is when i am doingls -labefore exec it listsmainin x mode
4 [2017-05-28T13:57:49] <lukaskroepfl> yes
5 [2017-05-28T13:59:56] <lukaskroepfl> i tried addingchmod +x /mainbut didnt work out.. whats shebang?
6 [2017-05-28T14:00:06] <lukaskroepfl> ..in the entrypoint.sh
7 [2017-05-28T14:00:13] <vikas027> the error would be different if./mainis not executable
8 [2017-05-28T14:00:43] <vikas027> Shebang is#!/path/to/<your_shell>at the top of yourentrypoint.sh
9 [2017-05-28T14:00:55] <Clausewitz45_twitter> Shebang: first line of the script, something like this#!/bin/shor similar
10 [2017-05-28T14:01:25] <Clausewitz45_twitter> vikas027: 's answer is better :-)
11 [2017-05-28T14:01:45] <lukaskroepfl> ah well thats set to /bin/sh
12 [2017-05-28T14:02:26] <lukaskroepfl> i trieddocker run -it <image> /mainand gotstandard_init_linux.go:178: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
13 [2017-05-28T14:03:09] <vikas027> docker run -it <image> ls -l /?
14 [2017-05-28T14:03:58] <lukaskroepfl> that listsmain
15 [2017-05-28T14:04:12] <lukaskroepfl> even as executable
16 [2017-05-28T14:05:55] <vikas027> Is your script calling./main? Double check that. I would run a script in averbosemode like#!/bin/sh -xor do apwdand/orls -l(in the script) to double check if it is doing the right thing
17 [2017-05-28T14:08:44] <diegoxro> Clausewitz45_twitter: I was thinking the same thing
18 [2017-05-28T14:08:56] <lukaskroepfl> so I am doingCOPY build/main /mainand in entrypoint.shexec /mainpwdprints/
19 [2017-05-28T14:12:42] <lukaskroepfl> wtf I removed exec /main, ran and exec the container, did a ls andmainwas not there
20 [2017-05-28T14:12:55] <diegoxro> lol
21 [2017-05-28T14:15:05] <diegoxro> COPY ./yourscript.sh /ENTRYPOINT ["/yourscript.sh"]
22 [2017-05-28T14:15:44] <diegoxro> are you using the right image? , that has happened to me before lol
23 [2017-05-28T14:23:09] <lukaskroepfl> ok whats wrong when i am doing ./main in the running container and sh says main not found?
24 [2017-05-28T14:23:30] <diegoxro> paste your Dockerfile
25 [2017-05-28T14:23:50] <iglov> maybe wrong WORKDIR ...
26 [2017-05-28T14:24:08] <lukaskroepfl>  [<-CODE->]
27 [2017-05-28T14:24:42] <lukaskroepfl> note that ls lists main in the container
28 [2017-05-28T14:24:54] <diegoxro> COPY source destinationpath, no need to specify the name again
29 [2017-05-28T14:24:59] <iglov> so-o-o, where is really your entrypoint.sh ?
30 [2017-05-28T14:25:15] <lukaskroepfl> ah kk will try that
31 [2017-05-28T14:25:17] <diegoxro> and entry point is not really what you want if you want to exec main
32 [2017-05-28T14:25:52] <diegoxro> COPY main /ENTRYPOINT ["/main"]
33 [2017-05-28T14:27:01] <diegoxro> although entrypoint scripts are usually are wrapper/helper scripts to call your main program
34 [2017-05-28T14:27:09] <lukaskroepfl> tried entrypoint ["/main"] gotstandard_init_linux.go:178: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
35 [2017-05-28T14:27:32] <lukaskroepfl> well i need to do some more things in entrypoint.sh
36 [2017-05-28T14:29:27] <diegoxro> how!! lol
37 [2017-05-28T14:29:49] <lukaskroepfl> no idea
38 [2017-05-28T14:29:50] <diegoxro> are you rebuilding the image?
39 [2017-05-28T14:29:56] <diegoxro> you should
40 [2017-05-28T14:31:16] <lukaskroepfl> yeah I am rebuilding the image with the same tag every time
41 [2017-05-28T14:31:34] <diegoxro> ok that works
42 [2017-05-28T14:34:29] <diegoxro> do one image without the ENTRYPOINT and create a container just make sure the main is being loaded in the right path
43 [2017-05-28T14:35:32] <lukaskroepfl> ah I think it has to to smth with the binary itself ..
44 [2017-05-28T14:37:21] <diegoxro> that does not explain the "no such file or directory" error tho :/
45 [2017-05-28T14:38:47] <lukaskroepfl>  [<-LINK->] ;)
46 [2017-05-28T14:39:01] <iglov>  [<-LINK->]
47 [2017-05-28T14:39:26] <iglov> maybe problem in your "main" ?
48 [2017-05-28T14:40:01] <lukaskroepfl> lolRUN mkdir /lib64 && ln -s /lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2and it works
49 [2017-05-28T14:40:15] <diegoxro> lol
50 [2017-05-28T14:40:16] <diegoxro> nice
51 [2017-05-28T14:40:38] <lukaskroepfl> thx@iglov:)I need to compile the go appl differently
52 [2017-05-28T14:40:42] <iglov> yep, with your "main" ...
53 [2017-05-28T14:41:27] <Clausewitz45_twitter> nice one
54 [2017-05-28T14:43:32] <lukaskroepfl> so building the binary withgo build --ldflags \'-extldflags "-static"\' -o ./build/main ./srccreates a static binary and works without theRUNcmd above :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-28T13:57:45] <vikas027> How are your copying a binary. I am assuming thruCOPY
2 [2017-05-28T13:58:36] <vikas027> Try docker run /your/image /main
3 [2017-05-28T13:58:45] <vikas027> does it gets executed ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-28T13:59:13] <Clausewitz45_twitter> I know sounds stupid, but is the./mainfile is executable? Shebang is set?
2 [2017-05-28T14:14:06] <Clausewitz45_twitter> welcome to the matrix

1 [2017-05-28T14:41:05] <matrixbot> Rahulkrishnan(rark)Is it required to add any plugin to while creating a container to access the iscsi storage
2 [2017-05-28T14:44:43] <matrixbot> Rahulkrishnan(rark)I have attached iscsi initiator to the host and format with filesystem and then attach  to the container while creating , its working fine without any volume plugin... Please let me know is this the way attaching iscsi or any other volume plugin available to attach it directly

1 [2017-05-29T01:52:27] <siassaj> Hi all
2 [2017-05-29T01:53:45] <siassaj> I think I've asked this question before; given the following: [<-CODE->] Each one of those commands takes a couple seconds to complete. Is that normal?
3 [2017-05-29T01:54:36] <siassaj> eg. ARG whatever, should that take 2 seconds to complete?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-29T02:45:41] <siassaj> does docker cp turn on a container for the image, copy things in/out and then turn off that container?
2 [2017-05-29T02:46:28] <siassaj> to be more clear, I have several docker cp calls in my build script that copies build artefacts out of the docker image to be held onto as cache, which is then copied back into the docker image before building
3 [2017-05-29T02:48:24] <siassaj> dumb question, i'm already building a container, it's just not on
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-29T05:15:27] <santosh2812> Hi@SISheogorath, can you suggest me any redis cluster Image by which we can create 3 master or more with corresponding slaves on different Machine (Docker Container ), as currently am not able to do so and also not able to connect with different master.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-29T09:33:42] <SISheogorath> santosh2812: I'm pretty sure there is no out of the box solution right now
2 [2017-05-29T09:34:20] <SISheogorath> But [<-LINK->] looks promising, maybe you can work on it or write it yourself
3 [2017-05-30T09:26:01] <SISheogorath> In this case it's maybe a dependency problem

1 [2017-05-29T15:38:05] <gdeverlant> Hi guys
2 [2017-05-29T15:38:13] <gdeverlant> I'Ve posted an issue on [<-ISSUE->]
3 [2017-05-29T15:38:25] <gdeverlant> I was wondering if I'm doing something wrong with docker
4 [2017-05-29T15:38:40] <gdeverlant> I dockerized a 32 bits RethinkDB
5 [2017-05-29T15:38:52] <gdeverlant> and I was trying to run it inside of a 64 bits server
6 [2017-05-29T15:39:05] <gdeverlant> since there is no 64 bits of RethinkDB
7 [2017-05-29T15:39:27] <gdeverlant> and all of this is running on ARM64 Bits servers with docker v17.05ce
8 [2017-05-29T15:39:47] <gdeverlant> Am I doing something wrong here
9 [2017-05-29T15:40:08] <gdeverlant> because when I run the binary without docker raw on the server
10 [2017-05-29T15:40:10] <gdeverlant> it works fine
11 [2017-05-29T15:40:17] <gdeverlant> but not in dockerized version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-29T17:16:03] <SISheogorath> Do you use the exact same binary?
2 [2017-05-30T00:06:36] <gdeverlant> yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-30T17:09:53] <renegoretzka> hello, i have a big big problem.. somehow rancher recreated a container and i lost all the data which were in the container.. is there any way to restore it? i did not have a volume attached
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-30T18:24:54] <imaia> folks, I'm having a trouble declaring named containers in docker-compose
2 [2017-05-30T18:26:07] <imaia>  [<-CODE->] Shouldn't the code above work? Like, declare a named volume called ux-data mapped to /home/user/volumes/ux-data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-30T20:58:43] <shawninder> I just noticed my repos all disappeared from Docker Hub, yet I can stilldocker pullthem. Is anyone here aware of any trouble on the docker hub side?
2 [2017-05-30T20:59:35] <gdeverlant> renegoretzka: You cannot recover delete container data unless you used a persistent-driver
3 [2017-05-30T20:59:45] <gdeverlant> to create the volume or the mapping
4 [2017-05-30T21:00:00] <gdeverlant> I might be wrong here but this is what I've learned
5 [2017-05-30T21:04:41] <shawninder> I found my answer, there is currently an incident affecting many docker services, more info: [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-30T23:11:21] <SISheogorath> renegoretzka: there is a little chance. If the image used for the container has decelerated the directory you need to restore asVOLUMEthere is maybe a unnamed volume remaining, that holds the data. Check withdocker volume ls. If not, it's gone
2 [2017-05-30T23:12:07] <SISheogorath> but in general: no volume, no persistent data
3 [2017-05-30T23:13:36] <SISheogorath> imaia: you have to declerate the volume path (inside the container) in theservices:inside your container, not in the volume section. There you decelerate things like the volume driver and options
4 [2017-05-30T23:13:54] <SISheogorath> shawninder: should be fixed now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-30T23:53:38] <gdeverlant> renegoretzka: I recommend you to use this amazing plugin that I'm using in my cluster with docker swarm
2 [2017-05-30T23:53:51] <gdeverlant> It's a legacy plugin but it does the job
3 [2017-05-30T23:54:02] <gdeverlant>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-05-30T23:54:18] <gdeverlant> it will create your volumes with persistency and never delete them
5 [2017-05-30T23:54:46] <gdeverlant> like when you use docker run -v /path/to/my:/path/to/container
6 [2017-05-30T23:54:52] <gdeverlant> but with volumes
7 [2017-05-30T23:54:56] <gdeverlant> it is very usefull
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T00:16:36] <chkm8> hi guys, i would like to ask if is it possible to use docker in windows 2008 server?
2 [2017-05-31T00:18:11] <SISheogorath> chkm8: not as far as I know. You have to use Windows Server 2016 or linux. Especially if you want to go in production. For development using docker toolbox or docker4Windows (warning only for Windows 10) fine, but don't try to use them in production
3 [2017-05-31T00:20:24] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: I'm not sure about the idea that a deleted volume remains is the right way. Because exactly that is what you have volume handling for. To explicitly decide what you want to persist and what you want to delete. Anyways, in production you shouldn't use local volumes
4 [2017-05-31T00:40:00] <chkm8> darn windows, thanks@SISheogorathwe will just look for alternative way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T00:40:10] <gdeverlant> I use volumes on each nodes
2 [2017-05-31T00:40:13] <gdeverlant> for DB
3 [2017-05-31T00:40:33] <gdeverlant> volume mounting
4 [2017-05-31T00:40:42] <gdeverlant> with the local-persist plugin
5 [2017-05-31T00:40:53] <gdeverlant> I don't know if this is a bad practice

3 [2017-05-31T01:05:39] <SISheogorath> gerome0123: please make sure docker is running, what OS are you using?
4 [2017-05-31T01:06:06] <SISheogorath> For most OS the commandsystemctl status dockershould give you the answer

1 [2017-05-31T03:40:10] <jmsherry> Hey guys, I'm new to docker and wondered if you could help?I dockerised a simple express file server from scratch and was able to view it in the browser at localhost and obviously 0.0.0.0 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Does anyone know why??
2 [2017-05-31T04:25:08] <jmsherry> OK, so more research shows that this is a node 7 thing (http://blog.lholmquist.org/promise-rejection-handling/) but I still can't reach the container from the outside. :/Repo at: https://github.com/jmsherry/cd3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T08:14:44] <mingliang7> I cant run this docker command in cronPATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bin\n*/2 * * * * /bin/bash docker exec -it mongo mongodump --db restaurant --out /dump/restaurant/$(date +%Y-%m-%d) && docker cp mongo:/dump/restaurant ~/Desktop/mongo && docker exec -it mongo rm -rf dump/restaurant
2 [2017-05-31T08:44:47] <mingliang7> can you give me example for that ?
3 [2017-05-31T08:53:34] <iglov> something like thisdocker exec -it mongo mongodump --db restaurant --out /dump/restaurant/$(date +%Y-%m-%d) && docker cp mongo:/dump/restaurant /var/mongo/ && docker exec -it mongo rm -rf dump/restaurant
4 [2017-05-31T08:53:39] <iglov> mingliang7:
5 [2017-05-31T08:55:50] <iglov> but  maybe better mount with-vdirectory /dump/restaurant ? It'd be much simple, i think
6 [2017-05-31T09:20:01] <mingliang7> iglov: it's not working. Yes  -v options is great but i just want to backup db everyday. if you use -v options is not a good idea
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T08:42:25] <iglov> maybe cuz need use full path without ~ ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T08:47:14] <dv29> I am working on a nodejs project, and have got docker working on it, have a volume fornode_modulesbut i need to access binaries inside the bin folder, any idea, how can i accomplish that.its give outroot:rootfor owner and group
2 [2017-05-31T09:15:37] <dv29> carlosjgp: i am using docker-compose, have tried it with $UID on that one
3 [2017-05-31T10:05:22] <dv29> carlosjgp: i tried that and i think it worked, but now npm cannot create/.npmdirectory
4 [2017-05-31T10:05:47] <dv29> asks for sudo permission, any idea?
5 [2017-05-31T10:12:13] <dv29> i guess, running, coz i am doingnpm installin entrypoint file
6 [2017-05-31T10:12:38] <dv29> i am doing exactly that, create a volume for that folder
7 [2017-05-31T10:14:37] <dv29>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T09:00:45] <gdeverlant> @gdeverlant@gdeverlant I'm not sure about the idea that a deleted volume remains is the right way. Because exactly that is what you have volume handling for. To explicitly decide what you want to persist and what you want to delete. Anyways, in production you shouldn't use local volumes@SISheogorath The idea was to persist deleted container's volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T09:08:31] <carlosjgp> dv29: if you are running docker on linuxdocker run -u $UID:$GID .... But as a good practice create your own user insede your container and use it to run your containers " [<-LINK->] "
2 [2017-05-31T09:14:40] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: What is the output ofdocker ps? Does is shows your container port 8080 exposed?
3 [2017-05-31T09:20:19] <carlosjgp> dv29: As far as I knowdocker-composehas no support for the--userflag... try this --> [<-LINK->] but using youruidandgid
4 [2017-05-31T09:22:51] <carlosjgp> kevinlincg: Yes, try to keep them on their own container. It\'s one of the container principles " [<-LINK->] "
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T09:18:32] <kevinlincg> hi , I am new in docker , I need some suggest.  I have an web application with  golang as backend  and angularjs as frontend  and mysql as database .  Should I seperate they to three different containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T10:09:24] <carlosjgp> dv29: This is because now your container is not running using therootuser, but a custom user. In which stage do you have the problem, building or running the container?as workaorund you can map a volume to that folder... so you save all the npm modules outside the container which will save time if you create a new one ;)
2 [2017-05-31T10:14:39] <carlosjgp> dv29: So it's because that folder has been created by the container usingrootas user. Just delete your local folder fornpm_modulesor change the owner and group to yours
3 [2017-05-31T10:15:09] <dv29> carlosjgp: i am rebuilding everything, but before that i delete everything
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T11:21:51] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: :docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 cd:0.0.1docker ps1c5ea5a96d5e        cd:0.0.1            "npm run start:pro..."   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   condescending_hugle
2 [2017-05-31T13:53:50] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: Yes, it runs fine outside...
3 [2017-05-31T13:54:47] <jmsherry> (And yes the port is set to 8080)
4 [2017-05-31T14:12:11] <jmsherry>  [<-CODE->] That's it, right?! There's nothing else??
5 [2017-05-31T14:20:51] <jmsherry> The worst thing is that I'm trying to convince people of how easy and good docker is, but stuff like this just gives ammunition to people stuck in their ways...
6 [2017-05-31T14:21:21] <jmsherry> Like I said, I can run it outside without issue and I can go inside the container and cURL it without issue too! Grrr...
7 [2017-05-31T14:32:00] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: I'd have to install something in the image to do that, right?! Likeopenssh-server??
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T11:50:32] <SISheogorath> @gdeverlant I was aware of the idea, but that\'s exactly what volumes are for... Keep data until you want to delete them. And when you delete a volume, the data are gone. Of course you can "hack" something together to just mimes volumes, but as mentioned, it breaks the idea. Maybe checkout the idea behind volumes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_%28computing%29Hint: In most real production use cases docker volumes are volumes on a storage server so they are handled different. the local behavior is mainly to have something working during development ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T13:53:08] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: Everything looks good here... is npm server/process using por 8080? Can you run the app outside the container without issues?
2 [2017-05-31T14:25:36] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: try to ssh into your contianer and cUrllocalhost:8080
3 [2017-05-31T14:26:08] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: That's what I did! That works...
4 [2017-05-31T14:26:39] <jmsherry> Oh, wait, you mean NOT viadocker exec?!
5 [2017-05-31T14:26:53] <carlosjgp> yep
6 [2017-05-31T14:32:27] <carlosjgp> justdocker exec <container-name>  bash(maybeashif is based on alpine )
7 [2017-05-31T14:33:21] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: Yes, I did that and it works...
8 [2017-05-31T14:33:45] <carlosjgp> and did you check the logs?docker logs ...
9 [2017-05-31T14:35:01] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: I didn't because it seemed to be working fine. Inside the container the local server gives me back what I want. Outside it's just like there's no connection... (I'll go in and check the logs now to see if there's anything interesting...)
10 [2017-05-31T14:42:23] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: So, I connected to bash fine. I checked the logs withdocker logsand it's just what I see during the boot process. There's nothing afterwards. :/
11 [2017-05-31T14:43:10] <jmsherry> ( I just pushed the latest version of the project to github, so you can see if you want: [<-LINK->] )
12 [2017-05-31T14:47:33] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: And the command tobuildandrunthat image?
13 [2017-05-31T14:49:38] <jmsherry> Yes, in the docker file: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-05-31T14:50:37] <jmsherry> In the npm scripts you've got: [<-CODE->]
15 [2017-05-31T14:51:45] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-05-31T15:10:15] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: but how do you run your docker image?docker run  ...  cd3?
2 [2017-05-31T15:13:22] <jmsherry> carlosjgp: docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 cd:0.0.1I've just found an issue running outside the app! It cURLs fine but won't attach to browser...Let me get back to you. Sorry and Thanks
3 [2017-05-31T16:00:48] <carlosjgp> jmsherry: It's really strange... try to run in other portdocker run -it --rm -p 8089:8080 cd:0.0.1. I can't think on anthing else... Hope it works!
4 [2017-05-31T16:22:46] <jmsherry> jorandradefig: what's the colon for in the path??
5 [2017-05-31T16:23:31] <jorandradefig> The right side is for the path in the container

1 [2017-05-31T21:45:41] <mmcintyre123> Hi there, wondering if anyone has used Docker for continuous integration for mobile testing on iOS?
2 [2017-05-31T21:49:33] <mmcintyre123> I have automated mobile app tests setup using Appium, written in Node.js, for testing iOS and Android apps.  I build the iOS app using XCode command line tools, use git for source control, and mocha to run the tests. Currently they run locally in an iOS simulator. I am looking at using Shippable to create continuous integration, and Docker seems like a good way to create an environment Shippable can point to to run the tests on.  But this means I will need to create a Docker image with xcode command line tools, as well as Appium, Mocha, and everything else needed to run the tests.  Is this possible?  I'm worried about the xcode command line tools in particular, since XCode is licensed.  Does anyone know if this is possible or has anyone set it up?

1 [2017-06-01T14:29:16] <mmcintyre123> Is it possible to install XCode command line tools in a Docker image?
2 [2017-06-01T14:33:09] <mmcintyre123> Has anyone done this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-01T14:39:25] <mmcintyre123> Interesting, thanks Carlos!  So I'm trying to create a Docker image for my automated mobile tests for iOS.  I would then pass that image to Shippable, in order to create continuous integration - Shippable detects a change to the repo, then kicks off tests in the Docker image.  If I created a Docker host in network mode, would this conceivably be able to communicate with my local machine, i.e. actually run the tests on my local machine, after being triggered from Shippable (cloud based)?
2 [2017-06-01T14:46:19] <mmcintyre123> Ok thanks.  So there's really no method yet to use xcode command line tools in a regular cloud hosted docker container?
3 [2017-06-01T15:08:08] <mmcintyre123> lol owned by Apple says it all.  Oh well thanks for the info!

20 [2017-06-01T19:15:44] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
21 [2017-06-01T19:20:53] <gdeverlant> What does this mean
22 [2017-06-01T19:21:07] <gdeverlant> This is the Swarm Manager [<-CODE->]
23 [2017-06-01T19:21:16] <gdeverlant> the 2 first one what are they
24 [2017-06-01T19:22:14] <gdeverlant> no
25 [2017-06-01T19:22:22] <gdeverlant> they are all connected to a switch
26 [2017-06-01T19:22:31] <gdeverlant> and the router is connecter to a DSL router
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-01T19:21:54] <SISheogorath> what kind of "server" is your manager node? something physical? something with a modem?
2 [2017-06-01T19:22:50] <SISheogorath> Or does it do some kind of VPN?
3 [2017-06-01T19:23:03] <gdeverlant> yes i've put a VPN on the Swarm Manageer
4 [2017-06-01T19:23:11] <gdeverlant> can that pose a problem for docker ?
5 [2017-06-01T19:23:14] <SISheogorath> That's your problem :D
6 [2017-06-01T19:23:20] <gdeverlant> PPTPD
7 [2017-06-01T19:23:24] <SISheogorath> check your routing tables ;)
8 [2017-06-01T19:23:36] <gdeverlant> how do I do that ?
9 [2017-06-01T19:23:40] <SISheogorath> shared kernels means also shared routing tables
10 [2017-06-01T19:23:57] <SISheogorath> create the overlay network outside of 10.0.0.0/8
11 [2017-06-01T19:25:01] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-06-01T19:25:21] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
13 [2017-06-01T19:25:26] <gdeverlant> is this ok ?
14 [2017-06-01T19:25:53] <SISheogorath> no... It is still part of the 10.0.0.0/8 network
15 [2017-06-01T19:26:04] <gdeverlant> how do you know ?
16 [2017-06-01T19:26:26] <gdeverlant> or how can I move the PPTPD
17 [2017-06-01T19:26:32] <gdeverlant> to another place ?
18 [2017-06-01T19:26:58] <gdeverlant> I didn't control the first ingress network docker swarm created it automatically
19 [2017-06-01T19:27:12] <gdeverlant> the swarm-net I created
20 [2017-06-01T19:28:19] <SISheogorath> Subnetting -> here you go:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.htmlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork
21 [2017-06-01T19:28:40] <gdeverlant> ohhhh that's so stupid I didn't realize that it could mess with docker swarm this pptpd
22 [2017-06-01T19:29:14] <SISheogorath> want a really easy way to get out of it? use another server as manager and kick out the one with the PPPTD ;)
23 [2017-06-01T19:30:34] <SISheogorath> You can configure it to not have any problem with it but that's a lot of work and I'm not really in the mood to explain how to use multiple routing tables, network rules and network namespacing in general :D
24 [2017-06-01T19:30:45] <gdeverlant> sudo apt-get autoremove --purge pptpd
25 [2017-06-01T19:30:59] <gdeverlant> is this enough ?
26 [2017-06-01T19:31:13] <SISheogorath> I won't say yes or no, I have no idea of your setup and what it possibly breaks
27 [2017-06-01T19:31:24] <SISheogorath> that's something you have to know
28 [2017-06-01T19:31:49] <gdeverlant> i just installed a basic pptpd setup from a tutorial online
29 [2017-06-01T19:32:35] <SISheogorath> mahenrique94: glad to hear that it works :) still a weird issue
30 [2017-06-01T19:33:18] <gdeverlant> this is the tutorial [<-LINK->]
31 [2017-06-01T19:38:35] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: how can I revert those lines  in step 4
32 [2017-06-01T19:38:39] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
33 [2017-06-01T19:40:24] <SISheogorath> Here you go: [<-LINK->]
34 [2017-06-01T19:42:59] <SISheogorath> mahenrique94: It's difficult to say it completely for sure. First of all it depends on the database itself. Some care more about data consistency other less. Then again it depends on the underlying file system you use as database storage, the configuration of the database, sometimes even the configuration of your host systems kernel...
35 [2017-06-01T19:43:01] <gdeverlant> from input I know
36 [2017-06-01T19:43:08] <gdeverlant> but there is nat tables
37 [2017-06-01T19:43:55] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: Here you go:iptables -L -v --line-numbers
38 [2017-06-01T19:46:40] <SISheogorath> or to make it a bit shorter:iptables -t nat -v -L POSTROUTING -n --line-number
39 [2017-06-01T19:47:59] <gdeverlant> now I get it thanx a lot buddy I will remove all that junk I've put there
40 [2017-06-01T19:48:10] <gdeverlant> and come reset my setup
41 [2017-06-01T19:48:14] <gdeverlant> and test again
42 [2017-06-01T19:48:39] <gdeverlant> what an idiot I am with installing PPTPD  without thinking it might hurt
43 [2017-06-01T20:31:29] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: I've cleaned my iptables
44 [2017-06-01T20:31:45] <gdeverlant> but I was wondering if this many entries are normal in my nat table
45 [2017-06-01T20:31:50] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
46 [2017-06-01T20:45:40] <SISheogorath> docker has to use NAT, too
47 [2017-06-01T21:04:29] <gdeverlant> yeah i removed almost all of the things there
48 [2017-06-01T21:04:47] <gdeverlant> 4 left of the whole crew
49 [2017-06-01T21:27:27] <gdeverlant> hmmm it doesn't work
50 [2017-06-01T21:27:37] <gdeverlant> although I restarted all my setup
51 [2017-06-01T21:28:04] <gdeverlant> can I deploy 3 services on swarm manager via docker service create
52 [2017-06-01T21:28:20] <gdeverlant> which one of them is Traefik
53 [2017-06-01T21:28:51] <gdeverlant> and expect Traefik to be able to route other services deployed via docker stack deploy ?
54 [2017-06-01T21:29:15] <gdeverlant> on the second worker
55 [2017-06-01T21:30:25] <gdeverlant> hmmmm I just got theses : Message from syslogd@bambuserver2 at Jun  1 21:23:31 ... kernel:[10816.283151@0] unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free.

1 [2017-06-04T12:48:46] <SISheogorath> aaronmcadam: Nope..dockerignoreshould work fine. But maybe you have to place it in your build context directory. I'm not sure if it works like.gitignoreand also works in subdirectories
2 [2017-06-04T12:54:11] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: there are a lot possible reasons for that. First of all please disable the firewall to check if it's a firewall problem. Than check your routing tables to make sure that there are not further routing conflicts. When you did this, please check if you can connect to another container inside your overlay network by pinging it and opening a telnet session. (Please also test, when it's happening, during both services are on the same host? Or only if they are on different hosts?) If all this works and you still get the time outs, please consider to open an issue on GitHub and provide all these information. Also feel free to try to reproduce it on an external setup, like Digital Ocean with their docker 1-click-App
3 [2017-06-04T21:45:46] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: can't say much about it. maybe it's a but, maybe it's a problem of your setup. I stay away from the arm hell so maybe it's a problem of your kernel.
4 [2017-06-05T11:26:42] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: the ARM hell exists. It's not because ARM is bad in any way, but because everything has to be cross compiled etc, simply because most free hosted CI solutions don't provide ARM. Also you have multiple versions of ARM, etc.. That's the ARM hell :D it's not easily possible to provide your software for all these platforms. Not to talk from the problems with docker images for these platforms.
5 [2017-06-05T11:30:07] <gdeverlant> not if your software is written in go
6 [2017-06-05T11:30:17] <gdeverlant> most of the software I'm using are written in go
7 [2017-06-05T11:36:17] <SISheogorath> Most software I use is written in C++ and C >.> and rewrite them in golang is not really an option
8 [2017-06-05T12:13:58] <gdeverlant> yeah I think that one of the reason they created on level of abstraction higher with golang
9 [2017-06-05T12:14:13] <gdeverlant> they were fedup of the kind of problem you encounter
10 [2017-06-05T15:30:58] <SISheogorath> aaronmcadam: playing [<-LINK->] :D
11 [2017-06-05T19:11:58] <SISheogorath> mahenrique94: The most important thing as always is that it has to work for you :) And depending on your use-case it's maybe the best way :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-04T16:13:06] <gdeverlant> I wanted to know if which kernel module are mandatory for the overlay networks ?
2 [2017-06-04T16:13:21] <gdeverlant> because CONFIG_IPVLAN  is missing I'm using kernel 3.10
3 [2017-06-04T16:15:49] <gdeverlant> I filled a ticket for HypriotOS [<-ISSUE->]
4 [2017-06-04T18:48:33] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: what do you think ?
5 [2017-06-04T21:46:25] <gdeverlant> it is actually a ipvlan module missing in the kernel
6 [2017-06-04T21:46:36] <gdeverlant> It took me 3 days to have my euroka Moment

1 [2017-06-05T20:58:59] <basz> hi newbe question. I read I need to create images via an dockerfile. Since I need to push that image to docker hub and a copy command in the dockerfile (the example I found an example usingCOPY ./ /var/www/html/) doesn’t that mean everything in.is now publicly available?

7 [2017-06-06T07:03:06] <SISheogorath> nischay30: yes, keep in mind that a bind-mount simply mounts the directory into the container. If your uid and gid inside the container don't have write permissions, it fails. Because it's a mess to take care about all these things it's recommended to use volumes

1 [2017-06-06T09:56:55] <santosh2812> carlosjgp: Hi, the port configuration worked and iam able to get connected from local IP but got another problem unable to scale it as we need 4 Sentinel and 2 slave with 1 master.  unable to understand how to configure the redis Sentinel on Docker which can be accessed from code and can work in failover . if you have any link please send. as currently I have followed [<-LINK->] but unable to connect or configure it so that it can be connected from code (C#).
2 [2017-06-07T07:36:53] <santosh2812> pjetr: Hi, actually i have followed lots of tutorial but unable to do the configuration with port forwarding so that it can be connect from outt side and from code. have also posted some query above, if possible please have allok.
3 [2017-06-07T07:57:17] <santosh2812> pjetr: , Thanks for your reply, but have checked all the links problem is am not able to use this in proper way and the tutorials are only giving that much information that use ANNOUNCE_IP for port forwarding.  as I am also new to docker and Redis.  Any way thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-06T11:43:39] <basz> SISheogorath: thought so... how do you work around that? Minimal code and A package installer? Private repositories? Thx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-06T11:50:57] <SISheogorath> @basz I work with open source projects, so this is not the biggest problem.Simple advice: Put only things into your image your want to publish. It'll change a bit with 17.06 with multi-staged builds

1 [2017-06-07T07:03:40] <santosh2812> Hi All, How can i create machine in docker and install redis Sentinel on it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-07T07:27:08] <pjetr> hi@santosh2812, what have you tried so far?
2 [2017-06-07T07:30:24] <pjetr> because, there's an image for that
3 [2017-06-07T07:30:25] <pjetr>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-06-07T07:30:50] <pjetr> so you could simply use that, or check out the sourcecode on the github repo
5 [2017-06-07T07:31:00] <pjetr> and find out how it works there
6 [2017-06-07T07:38:23] <pjetr> I had to look what redis sentinel is, since I have never used it, and I am a complete docker beginner :D
7 [2017-06-07T07:39:14] <pjetr> So I'm affraid I won't be able to help you any further than finding that image (that has 10k+ downloads)
8 [2017-06-07T07:40:35] <pjetr> https://github.com/s7anley/redis-sentinel-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile-3.0\nhttps://github.com/s7anley/redis-sentinel-docker/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh
9 [2017-06-07T07:41:27] <pjetr> Running sentinel with network setting bridge will break Sentinel's auto-discovery, unless you instruct Docker to map the port 1:1. To force Sentinel to announce a specific IP (e.g. your host machine) and mapped port, you should use ANNOUNCE_IP and ANNOUNCE_PORT environment variables. For more information see documentation.

1 [2017-06-09T07:26:34] <oversize> Hey, i have an nginx running on my OS X (not in a container). Then i have a container that wants to access that port (running in bridged network). i am not able to connect to that port. I am confused which interface (ip address?) would be the correct one to use. The DOCKER_HOST_IP from within the container (The one in the routing table)? or one of the local osx addresses (e.g.  the one en5 is assigned). Both dont let me connect. Which oneshouldbe the correct?I can access that port (on OS X) from within the container if using  host network mode though.  Using docker 17.03

My disk space usage kept going to 100%, I kept deleting all unused images and containers using the various tricks I found on the net, but/var/lib/docker/aufs/diffkept growing nontheless. I deleted a few folders in there that were linked to the trials and errors of a docker image part of a docker-compose I am working on. Yesterday, I rebuilt the same image over and over to try to fix a problem, and every once in a while I had to do a cleanup, but I reached a point where I realized that even when I was deleting all the unused containers and images (docker ps -a,docker imagesanddocker-compose psshows very little after cleanup), the disk usage kept growing and I couldn't built anymore without having to cleanup after each single one! Now when I try to rebuild my image, I get [<-CODE->]

4 [2017-06-09T23:07:25] <SISheogorath> Because it's a non-default port. Use a Reverse-Proxy to proxy your content over 80 and 443. Checkout Traefik

1 [2017-06-10T10:22:40] <scriptonist> Hey..i'm using docker python SDK . I have a question like, How do we pipe a file to a command inexec_runfunction
2 [2017-06-10T11:34:20] <scriptonist> all i want to do is pipe the contents of a file to a python script i want to run
3 [2017-06-10T11:34:25] <scriptonist> how can i do that ?
4 [2017-06-10T11:36:35] <scriptonist> i wanna mimic the following vanila linux commandecho "5" | python myscript.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T11:08:39] <SISheogorath> scriptonist: like usingcat file | docker exec ...?
2 [2017-06-10T11:09:10] <scriptonist> SISheogorath: Like thiscontainer.exec_run(['echo','5','>','python','test.py'])
3 [2017-06-10T11:10:09] <SISheogorath> Yes, I was asking what exactly you were referring to as pipe :D there are pipe function and pipes like in a shell
4 [2017-06-10T11:13:52] <scriptonist> i didn't know that. can u elaborate on that ?
5 [2017-06-10T11:17:03] <SISheogorath> A pipe function is a function that simply work on streams in general. Pipes like in a shell are a bit more specific. As they use std:in as stream input.
6 [2017-06-10T11:17:56] <scriptonist> i hope u understood my intention. How can i translate that to code ?
7 [2017-06-10T11:22:30] <SISheogorath> Well, that's the point, I didn't so I asked  do you want to pipe your file into it like a shell pipe or more like a general pipe with a File object stream?
8 [2017-06-10T11:57:04] <SISheogorath> that what I wanted to know :) I'm not perfect with python, but as far there is currently no really nice way to do it. what you can try is to set the stdin parameter true and print your file contense to std:in of your own program. very hacky, a bit crazy, but currently the only way I see
9 [2017-06-10T11:57:49] <scriptonist> cool thanks   lemme try that
10 [2017-06-10T12:02:54] <SISheogorath> I think you should open an issue for that on github, maybe you get a more solide advice there or if it's still the only way, an future implementation of it :)

2 [2017-06-10T12:38:59] <karneaud> does anybody know if you can "merge" host and container volumes?
3 [2017-06-10T12:40:03] <karneaud> I have a project using a docker image whose volume already has contents.....I need to merge by project files with the contents yet still persist my contents in the container
4 [2017-06-10T12:40:23] <karneaud> is there any method of archiving this?
5 [2017-06-10T12:40:29] <karneaud> methods*
6 [2017-06-10T13:16:33] <karneaud> anyone?

8 [2017-06-10T13:16:43] <karneaud> ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T13:17:24] <Coffee2CodeNL> Mount the volumes, copy manually
2 [2017-06-10T13:21:04] <karneaud> so the volumes_from doesn't do that?
3 [2017-06-10T13:21:17] <karneaud> *doesn;t already do that?
4 [2017-06-10T13:39:42] <Coffee2CodeNL> mount a folder, manually copy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T13:33:10] <SISheogorath> no, volumes_from simply uses the same volumes at the same mount point as the referenced container
2 [2017-06-10T13:33:26] <SISheogorath> there is no "merge" function
3 [2017-06-10T13:35:00] <karneaud> hmmm
4 [2017-06-10T13:35:15] <karneaud> so there is no way to "keep" the original contents of a mounted directory?
5 [2017-06-10T13:35:54] <karneaud> I don't think copy is an option as I need to persist the contents of the host to the container
6 [2017-06-10T13:45:47] <karneaud> define "manually copy" as in when I make a change scp into container each time?
7 [2017-06-10T13:53:36] <SISheogorath> docker cp
8 [2017-06-10T13:54:17] <SISheogorath> or mount the host directory and the volume and have a script that copies things over
9 [2017-06-10T13:57:25] <karneaud> hhhhmmmm

2 [2017-06-10T20:51:29] <rossdargan> I've ran: sudo apt-get update which includes Hit:8 [<-LINK->] xenial InRelease
3 [2017-06-10T20:52:05] <rossdargan> Then i ran sudo apt-get upgrade which said there was nothing to upgrade
4 [2017-06-10T20:52:14] <rossdargan> docker --versionDocker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e
5 [2017-06-10T20:55:16] <rossdargan> I thought it had to be called docker-ce
6 [2017-06-10T20:55:35] <wenlock> True
7 [2017-06-10T20:55:48] <rossdargan> ah lol well I have said apt-get install docker
8 [2017-06-10T20:56:10] <rossdargan> didn't help anyway
9 [2017-06-10T20:56:14] <rossdargan> :(
10 [2017-06-10T20:56:41] <rossdargan>  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T20:54:02] <wenlock> Apt-get update is to update the local package management database for apt, not for upgrading packages .  You probably just need to apt-get install docker again if your updating to a newer version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T21:01:01] <mark_potter_twitter> the version its trying to install there is suuuuper old
2 [2017-06-10T21:01:18] <rossdargan> yeah I thought it would be.
3 [2017-06-10T21:01:20] <mark_potter_twitter> like 2014?
4 [2017-06-10T21:01:36] <rossdargan> I think the default "docker" one is isn\'t it?
5 [2017-06-10T21:01:52] <rossdargan>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-06-10T21:02:36] <wenlock> Have you tried the get.docker.com script?
7 [2017-06-10T21:02:57] <rossdargan> nope
8 [2017-06-10T21:03:50] <wenlock> curl -sSL [<-LINK->] | sh
9 [2017-06-10T21:04:32] <rossdargan> If you already have Docker installed, this script can cause trouble, which iswhy we're displaying this warning and provide the opportunity to cancel theinstallation.
10 [2017-06-10T21:04:41] <rossdargan> hope it works ok :)
11 [2017-06-10T21:04:58] <wenlock> Yeah it might reset your images
12 [2017-06-10T21:05:16] <rossdargan> well, they are all managed through docker swarm/docker compose
13 [2017-06-10T21:05:22] <rossdargan> it'll be easily fixed thankfully
14 [2017-06-10T21:07:12] <rossdargan> Well... it's certainly doing something! Thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T21:08:10] <wenlock> Yep that script is nice, they hide some hard stuff for first timers
2 [2017-06-10T21:09:03] <rossdargan> That appears to have worked! fab!
3 [2017-06-10T21:09:11] <wenlock> Nice
4 [2017-06-10T21:09:43] <rossdargan> And now portainer works :)
5 [2017-06-10T21:09:45] <rossdargan> fab.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-10T21:16:34] <rossdargan> Does docker swarm ever rebalance nodes?
2 [2017-06-10T21:17:01] <rossdargan> sorry, not nodes services
3 [2017-06-10T21:18:03] <rossdargan> I know I can run docker service updateservice--force
4 [2017-06-10T21:18:13] <rossdargan> is there anyway to do it across all services
5 [2017-06-10T21:40:19] <rossdargan> never mind it did it itself :)

4 [2017-06-12T02:55:50] <russellwmy> SISheogorath: in docker swarm mode,  when one node overloaded, the docker create new container, but it cant terminate the old container. in my case, I am using celery with 30 threads and at the end 60 threads are running, so the server freeze.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T03:42:32] <foreversunyao_twitter> hello, I have a question, does anyone use Flocker for Persistent Storage ? for example, for mysql ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T13:26:52] <rossdargan> I have a reasonable server that I use to host 3 vms all running docker (docker1->3).I have a small media pc that runs docker4.All are configured for docker swarm.Naively I set up all as swarm managers, but I've realized that if I reboot my main server docker4 just gives up because of (N/2)+1.I'm now planning on demoting 2 of the vm's swarms to just workers, and adding in a cheap raspberry pi to act as a manager.This should leave me with 3 managers. Will this allow me to restart my server without issue?
2 [2017-06-12T14:29:13] <rossdargan> SISheogorath: fab - ta!
3 [2017-06-12T20:22:10] <rossdargan> I have a docker container running on a swarm. It needs access to a device however so I can't create it as a service
4 [2017-06-12T20:22:21] <rossdargan> Can I still join it to a overlay network?
5 [2017-06-12T20:24:09] <rossdargan> ok, not sure if it is possible or not, but since the container is part of the host network it is not possible
6 [2017-06-12T20:48:26] <rossdargan> can anyone tell me whats going on with this service:ross@dar-docker-01:~$ docker service ps plexpyID                  NAME                IMAGE                 NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE             ERROR                              PORTSmdaibk18i4y2        plexpy.1            flxel/plexpy:latest   dar-docker-01       Shutdown            Shutdown 19 minutes agovtp13tj0lo5a         _ plexpy.1        flxel/plexpy:latest                       Shutdown            Pending 20 minutes agoj52k94fcdfof         _ plexpy.1        flxel/plexpy:latest                       Shutdown            Pending 20 minutes agomxzapzl8o365         _ plexpy.1        flxel/plexpy:latest   dar-docker-04       Shutdown            Shutdown 10 hours agoj1ps64ndrrui         _ plexpy.1        flxel/plexpy:latest   dar-docker-03       Shutdown            Failed 2 days ago         "starting container failed: Ad…"
7 [2017-06-12T20:48:38] <rossdargan> it's just stuck pending I think
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T14:00:45] <SISheogorath> yes, this should work@rossdargan
2 [2017-06-12T16:43:52] <SISheogorath> not really. You have to overwrite the file
3 [2017-06-12T16:44:34] <SISheogorath> shuntera: you can use the same script or useapt-get update && apt-get upgradeas usual
4 [2017-06-12T16:45:17] <SISheogorath> rightisleft: you can maybe use an environment variable if you want. But that doesn't make the things easier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T14:12:46] <jdgiotta> Where can I get help with the docker go sdk?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T15:44:54] <shuntera> I’m not following the previous conversation, I  have Version:      17.04.0-ce on my Raspberry Pi’s and I installed them using the curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh command.How should I now upgrade docker from this point on?
2 [2017-06-12T16:45:46] <shuntera> SISheogorath: Do you know what the current version of Docker is for the Pi?
3 [2017-06-12T16:46:39] <SISheogorath> shuntera: I'm not user of the ARM builds, but in general it should be 17.03 for stable builds and 17.05 for edge builds
4 [2017-06-12T16:47:38] <SISheogorath> But there was a discussion about it all this recently in the ARM channel in the docker community Slack, so I'm not completely sure
5 [2017-06-12T16:49:09] <SISheogorath> not really sure a symlink works. Because you'll probably only mount the symlink :D
6 [2017-06-12T17:17:44] <shuntera> @SISheogorath OK, I did the upgrade on my Pi’s and I am now showing:Client: Version:      17.05.0-ce API version:  1.29 Go version:   go1.7.5 Git commit:   89658be Built:        Thu May  4 22:30:54 2017 OS/Arch:      linux/arm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T15:45:20] <rightisleft> does docker-compose support mounting of incremental build numbers?
2 [2017-06-12T15:45:28] <rightisleft>  [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-06-12T15:45:47] <rightisleft> IE: where 0.0.1 increments - how would i tell docker-compose to only mount the latest jar?
4 [2017-06-12T16:48:03] <rightisleft> i modified the build script to symlink an artifact
5 [2017-06-12T16:48:19] <rightisleft> server-XXX -> app.jar which then gets mounted as a volume
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T17:29:16] <jdgiotta> Is the #docker IRC channel dead?
2 [2017-06-12T17:34:15] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure about that. In general nearly all community related things switched to the docker community Slack
3 [2017-06-12T17:34:32] <SISheogorath> check [<-LINK->] to join
4 [2017-06-12T17:35:38] <jdgiotta> I'll take a look, thanks
5 [2017-06-12T17:37:52] <jdgiotta> SISheogorath: is community a good resource for asking SDK questions?
6 [2017-06-12T17:39:44] <SISheogorath> I would say yes, there are a lot of people and channels for all kind of topics. If you want to find an answer, that's a good place to start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-12T20:51:37] <sameetn> rossdargan: have you tried putting in on both networks? It may not be possible, but I do recall the ability to specify multiple networks
2 [2017-06-12T20:52:04] <rossdargan> sameetn: I think because it\'s on the "host" network it deff can\'t
3 [2017-06-12T20:53:02] <rossdargan> hmm I had to run docker service update plexpy --force to get it running eventually
4 [2017-06-12T20:53:16] <rossdargan> I don't understand why the scheduler didn't sort it.

1 [2017-06-13T13:56:20] <vroomanj> Does anyone know of a way I can simulate filling a container json log to test if my rotation is working? A command I can run in the container perhaps?
2 [2017-06-13T14:31:48] <vroomanj> SISheogorath: Ahhh I guess that makes more sense. Was trying to do it within my Jupyter Notebook container :P doesn't matter what type of container I do it in though I guess. Thank you much.
3 [2017-06-13T14:54:17] <vroomanj> SISheogorath: Worked! Appreciate the help :)

3 [2017-06-13T14:33:09] <SISheogorath> you're welcome, just make sure you pass it to the shell interpret inside the container

I'm using the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and add a sql script that creates the DB and all it's objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-13T17:49:35] <SISheogorath> Did you mount a volume?
2 [2017-06-13T17:50:25] <SISheogorath> And did you setup your script to only create the structure if it doesn't exist and not drop tables or databases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-14T08:56:40] <MariusDiacu_twitter> rightisleft: I also had this issue, I solved by mounting the entire directory. I don't think mounting a files works from host to container.

1 [2017-06-14T11:42:24] <basz> hello, being newish to docker i set upon creating a rabbitmq container with docker-compose I have so many questions… Hope I good here… Am I correct in assuming its database is not preserved between restarts unless i map it to a local volume? Is providing an entrypoint in the docker-compose.yml preventing the entrypoint DockerFile entrypoint from the image from being run? And if, so how do would I add addional runtime configuration, such a user account etc.
2 [2017-06-14T11:43:41] <basz> This image [<-LINK->] seems to run allright, but I can’t seem to define ssl options as it (re)creates its own rabbitmq.config
3 [2017-06-14T11:51:55] <pjetr> basz: you could take a stroll in the RabbitMQ source files, perhaps it could give you some insight

9 [2017-06-14T13:56:31] <basz> i have renamed every occurance of \'wrapper-entrypoint.sh’ to ‘wrapperentrypoint.sh’ and when i now dodocker-compose up --force-recreate mqit still complains aboutexec: \\"/wrapper-entrypoint.sh \\": permission denied”.

1 [2017-06-14T12:05:40] <rossdargan> I\'m having issues with a docker service that stops, but has the state "complete". Should the scheduler not try and re-start it?!

2 [2017-06-15T10:55:18] <ersagun> Im using multi stage build functuonaltiy. I have 2 from in my docker file. On of them is a maven image, taking my src and build it. Second one do a copy --from and get the jar build in first one and execute this in second from. It's an entrypoint
3 [2017-06-15T10:56:21] <ersagun> I want to share the m2 of maven in a volume, instead of copying because it's very bog
4 [2017-06-15T10:56:27] <ersagun> Big*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-15T09:08:44] <SISheogorath> Ersagun, why you need that volume?
2 [2017-06-15T09:13:47] <SISheogorath> MKiselev: cron is a bit difficult. Maybe checkout the indiehoster setups, linked for example in the official nextcloud image

1 [2017-06-16T08:40:43] <coding-yogi> Does docker build replace the existing image? My docker image is tagged with :latest tag
2 [2017-06-16T08:43:36] <coding-yogi> got the answer, it seems docker untags the previous image and tags the new one with tag :latest
3 [2017-06-16T15:03:28] <sameetn> matrixbot: it shows in the UI next to the image itself.
4 [2017-06-16T15:20:17] <sameetn> ersagun: the m2 is only needed during the build
5 [2017-06-16T15:20:21] <sameetn> so you could mount it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-16T14:16:31] <SISheogorath> Yes, image name + tag are unique. They automatically overwrite the old one
2 [2017-06-16T15:19:30] <SISheogorath> ersagun: as far as I know, that currently not possible.

2 [2017-06-16T15:29:22] <prasenjithaty> I’m trying to usefabric8/java-alpine-openjdk8-jreand bundling ffmpeg static build into the image
3 [2017-06-16T15:30:41] <prasenjithaty> but after I spin up my container and ssh into it, I cannot execute ffprobe on any video URL.
4 [2017-06-16T15:30:48] <prasenjithaty> Here is my Docker file
5 [2017-06-16T15:31:48] <prasenjithaty>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-06-16T15:59:48] <prasenjithaty> what I realized, is that, ffprobe works if there is no redirection

1 [2017-06-16T21:54:04] <tknp96_twitter> has anyone had any luck with sharing usb tuners with plex running in a container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-17T22:49:17] <morpheyesh> hello, i have a basic question, I used to pass PortBindings when starting container, when using the docker API. Now I believe, its deprecated, you cannot pass hostConfig when starting container. So, I could set the port binding when creating a container?
2 [2017-06-17T22:49:30] <morpheyesh> and starting that would work,  i presume..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-18T00:48:59] <JasonShin> How do you run multiple docker run (without -d) on a same ssh session?
2 [2017-06-18T00:49:14] <JasonShin> I have ability to use split screen but it's not tmux
3 [2017-06-18T00:49:42] <JasonShin> so as soon as I do anotherdocker run blah, previousdocker rungets terminated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-18T08:13:47] <SISheogorath> JasonShin: docker is no magical tool. It still follows the rules of a normal terminal application. If you don't want to use-dyou can use&sign.
2 [2017-06-18T08:14:04] <SISheogorath> But I wouldn't recommend that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-18T20:55:54] <SISheogorath> nagaraju02: what docker commands did you run? It basically sounds like a VMWare problem in your setup. Check the network isolation and that there is no firewall blocking connections before you try to run docker
2 [2017-06-18T20:56:15] <SISheogorath> Docker is not magic

1 [2017-06-18T22:59:46] <vroomanj> Has anyone used the NetApp nDVP plugin with Docker? I sense that it may not do what I wish it did :P looking for confirmation. Basically, I have a home volume on my NetApp which has home folders for all our users. I'd like to be able to have a Docker volume for each user's home directory (not create one, or copy it, just represent their folder as a Docker volume). I sense that the plugin only works at the volume level on the NetApp though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-19T23:15:00] <dpnova> hey is this the best place to discuss compose?
2 [2017-06-19T23:15:13] <dpnova> I'm finding some very odd behaviour with relative paths
3 [2017-06-19T23:15:42] <dpnova> what docker-compose config tells me isn't what it's trying to use when building images
4 [2017-06-20T00:29:21] <dpnova> SISheogorath: basically i have two compose files foo/1/docker-compose.yml and foo/2/3/docker-compose.yml
5 [2017-06-20T00:30:12] <dpnova> when i try and rundocker-compose -f foo/1/docker-compose.ym -f  foo/2/3/docker-compose.ymlsomething weird is happening with the build context location
6 [2017-06-20T00:30:37] <dpnova> my dockerfile isfoo/docker/Dockerfile.base
7 [2017-06-20T00:31:48] <dpnova> the build context doesn't seem to be repsected
8 [2017-06-20T00:32:08] <dpnova> docker-compose config is showing something that isn't the same as what the docker daemon is trying to use
9 [2017-06-20T00:37:29] <dpnova>  [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-06-20T00:37:41] <dpnova> this paragraph in the docs is incorrect
11 [2017-06-20T00:38:01] <dpnova> docker-compose config shows the relative path extended to be relative to where docker-compose is run
12 [2017-06-20T00:38:14] <dpnova> but the docker daemon gets the path relative to where the compose file is i think
13 [2017-06-20T00:38:56] <dpnova> so i think the bug is in docker-compose config
14 [2017-06-20T00:39:57] <dpnova> following from that, trying to use docker-compose with files at different nesting levels in a project doesn't work as  it interprets the relative context path once for all services even though the compose files are in different places
15 [2017-06-20T00:42:48] <dpnova> just ran with --verbose and confirmed the wrong path is being sent to the docker daemon
16 [2017-06-20T00:56:58] <dpnova> actually this is documented here: [<-LINK->] paragram above this section
17 [2017-06-20T00:57:00] <dpnova> that's annoying
18 [2017-06-20T01:15:20] <jbelmont> SISheogorath: great thanks that makes sense
19 [2017-06-20T01:17:53] <jbelmont> docker-compose.yml [<-CODE->] docker-compose.yml [<-CODE->]
20 [2017-06-20T01:18:01] <jbelmont> does this seem right@SISheogorath
21 [2017-06-20T01:19:02] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: no, not really, because now you'll build your image and name itgolang:1.8.3-alpinewhich is not really what you want
22 [2017-06-20T01:19:34] <jbelmont> oh yeah I forgot about that part
23 [2017-06-20T01:19:55] <SISheogorath> by the way, yourLABELlooks broken
24 [2017-06-20T01:21:49] <jbelmont> it should be like this rightLABEL maintainer "SvenDowideit@home.org.au”
25 [2017-06-20T01:26:30] <jbelmont> great thanks for all the help@SISheogorathyou got me up and running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T00:24:31] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: This can't work. You can use multiple from for multi-staged builds, but you are still limited to oneFROMper image in general. So at the end of the day you can use golang as base image OR mhart/alpine-node. If you need go inside your container use the node base image and install go. Or use the go base image and install node. It mainly depends on when you need what. I personally recommend to use the base image for the environment you want to use in runtime, not during build. But that's more a personal opinion
2 [2017-06-20T00:25:45] <SISheogorath> dpnova: the best place is the channel #docker-compose in the [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-06-20T00:26:07] <dpnova> thanks@SISheogorath
4 [2017-06-20T00:26:35] <SISheogorath> But you can may share your errors and problems ^^
5 [2017-06-20T00:26:39] <SISheogorath> maybe I can help
6 [2017-06-20T01:16:09] <SISheogorath> dpnova: looks like a known problem: [<-ISSUE->]
7 [2017-06-20T01:16:33] <SISheogorath> But I agree that it is annoying
8 [2017-06-20T01:17:37] <SISheogorath> On the other hand it's a way to overwrite configs. So it makes sense to use the relative path from the first docker-compose file. Not really perfect, I am with you, but it still makes sense
9 [2017-06-20T01:17:55] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: You're wekcome

1 [2017-06-20T01:44:11] <watzon> Is anyone here using Rancher currently?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T01:48:54] <dpnova> Sheogorath: i worked around it by having an empty compose file in the root of the project so all relative paths are anchored from that. I'll just force other devs to make sure it's included on the command line (actually I'll just create some wrappers)
2 [2017-06-20T01:51:30] <dpnova> I've added a comment on that issue for people looking for a workaround.

1 [2017-06-20T02:15:01] <watzon> What is the best way to handle persistency in Docker? I've been trying to find a container that I can mount volumes on, but I'm not having much luck
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T07:43:25] <andrewgy8> Hey all, im having trouble understanding data volumes and mounting them. The concept alone kind of throws me for a loop.  Anybody have suggestions on how to think about them?
2 [2017-06-20T07:45:25] <andrewgy8> Particularly, im trying to mount multiple postgres db in one and then access it via the postgres container.
3 [2017-06-20T07:57:01] <andrewgy8> Im just reading about them now. I suppose its a similar concept?
4 [2017-06-20T07:59:09] <andrewgy8> "the concept can become clearer if directories are instead visualized as nodes, i.e., as points, on a tree diagram of a filesystem from which other directories and files can branch off rather than as containers" from [<-LINK->]

3 [2017-06-20T15:48:07] <jbelmont> sorry@moisesrodriguezdidn’t mean to post over you
4 [2017-06-20T16:06:53] <jbelmont> moisesrodriguez: I added a comment to your gist, not sure if that will help though
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T15:46:30] <moisesrodriguez> Hello, I’m having an issue where I’m dumbfounded. As far I understand the issue Docker solves is that once you have a setup containerized with Docker, no matter where you run it be it Linux, macOs, Windows, in AWS, etc. It should be the same and work the same because it’s the exact same setup. Well I have this setup described here [<-LINK->] . When I run Docker in Ubuntu 16.04  and Windows 10 with this setup it runs without any issues and works just fine. However when I run it on my Docker for Mac, I always get an error with one of my Node.js modules. I’ve tried many workarounds I’ve found online about that dependency, but no luck. But the main issue is why the exact same Docker setup works on Ubuntu and Windows, but not in Mac! Any help is appreciated.
2 [2017-06-20T15:51:58] <moisesrodriguez> jbelmont: no worries, looks like we were both writing at the same time
3 [2017-06-20T16:11:24] <moisesrodriguez> jbelmont: question so instead of doingCOPY . /appyou are saying doADD . ${WORKDIR}?
4 [2017-06-20T16:11:39] <jbelmont> yes
5 [2017-06-20T16:11:53] <moisesrodriguez> will give it a try
6 [2017-06-20T17:12:03] <moisesrodriguez> SISheogorath: I built it on macOS.
7 [2017-06-20T17:14:49] <SISheogorath> Yves: you should avoid links. They are deprecated. Use the service names instead
8 [2017-06-20T17:15:15] <SISheogorath> moisesrodriguez: can you try to use an existing image just to verify that it's an issue during build time and not a general issue?
9 [2017-06-20T17:41:47] <moisesrodriguez> SISheogorath: I ended up completely uninstalling docker for mac and then installing it again and it worked. Go figure what was going on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T16:40:29] <SISheogorath> You should avoidADDas it has some nice, but very special effects. In general: If you can do something withCOPYdon't useADD
2 [2017-06-20T16:43:34] <SISheogorath> moisesrodriguez: did you build it on macOS or did you download the image?
3 [2017-06-20T16:45:17] <SISheogorath> And in general there should have been and errormessage during build process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T16:55:30] <matrixbot>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Any obvious mistake?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-20T17:22:55] <matrixbot> YvesSheogorath (Gitter): I agree, although there won't be any scale up and I was trying to mimic the initial working setup before optimizing.

2 [2017-06-21T11:15:54] <SISheogorath> JayZeeGP: you want them to write commands on start of your image or during build?
3 [2017-06-21T11:18:40] <SISheogorath> In general you can do this the same way as outside of docker. Addexec /bin/shfor example at the end of your shell script

1 [2017-06-22T18:00:44] <ebetica> Is there a way to force docker to exit on SIGTERM instead of passing it to the child process? I'm working in an HPC cluster and we're experiencing zombie docker processes because SLURM will send a SIGKILL if SIGTERM doesn't end the process.
2 [2017-06-22T19:51:41] <ebetica> SISheogorath: like I said, this is an HPC setup, so we\'re trying to allow the user to run arbitrary commands from the docker image. The CMD is [ "/bin/bash" ]
3 [2017-06-22T19:52:58] <ebetica> My issue is replicable like this: [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-06-22T19:53:25] <ebetica> I don't think there's anyway around creating a subshell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-22T18:55:11] <SISheogorath> ebetica: Can you show us a repository you use for your docker setups? I guess you call your application the wrong way. In general you have to make sure that theSIGTERMis passed correctly. So try to useexecif you use an entrypoint script and don\'t call your application usingCMD /myapporENTRYPOINT /myappbecause that will create a subshell. useCMD ["/myapp"]orENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]instead
2 [2017-06-22T19:58:46] <SISheogorath> okay, that's reasonable >.> you kill the docker daemon?
3 [2017-06-22T20:02:04] <ebetica> I have to do docker stop in this case, I want to avoid that somehow :(
4 [2017-06-22T20:03:35] <SISheogorath> why can't you use the init-script/system to do so?
5 [2017-06-22T20:03:46] <SISheogorath> something likesystemctl stop docker
6 [2017-06-22T20:05:07] <SISheogorath> But yes, in general you create zombies when you do this because you don't execute the command directly. But that's more a kernel thing than a real docker thing :/
7 [2017-06-22T20:17:03] <SISheogorath> I can't say :/ sry
8 [2017-06-22T20:18:31] <SISheogorath> I don't know what you use and how it works in detail, so it's pretty difficult to say
9 [2017-06-22T20:22:48] <SISheogorath> You should maybe consider to use a more low-level way to solve this issue by not talking to dockerd. Instead check the way K8s uses to schedule tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-22T20:12:32] <ebetica> this is supposed to be working with an HPC scheduler, so there may be other user's docker images running on the same host. I mean, I'm pretty happy even if docker intercepts the signal and kills the container it started with docker stop, but I don't think there's a way to get the docker container ID from the docker run process either
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-23T09:06:04] <cebor> Hi there was a doc page about how docker handles default hostnames for named docker containers in a docker network. But i cant find it anymore. There was something special with-and_.

1 [2017-06-25T12:23:27] <Chiefo> Hello, can the partition docker mounts to for its storage driver be changed? E.g., even though docker was installed to /var/lib/docker and contains directories like /var/lib/docker/aufs, for some reason it mounts to the root filesystem partition which I don't want. I had assumed it'd just naturally use whatever partition /var is on, but this isn't happening.
2 [2017-06-25T12:27:04] <Chiefo> It's annoying in that I discovered /var/lib/docker/aufs has at least 6gb and the root filesystem partition was originally intended to not have much space partitioned, it's filled up unnecessarily. I could not find a simple option anywhere that basically tells docker to stop auto-mounting away from /var/lib/docker, maybe I'm overlooking it.
3 [2017-06-25T13:16:01] <Chiefo> Solved, a silly mistake was made and assumptions blinded me to the answer until realization struck like a thunderbolt on a clear day.

5 [2017-06-26T10:11:04] <andrewgy8> When the containers are pushed onto the server, do i rundocker-compose uplike I have been doing locally?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-26T15:30:27] <aep> hmm, credsStore can't be set globally on dockerd can it? i'd rather not have it on every client

1 [2017-06-27T10:27:31] <SISheogorath> jeud: yes, check the many setups for nginx and php-fpm
2 [2017-06-27T23:28:34] <SISheogorath> jbelmont: as the official documentation doesn't show it, you should maybe drop themongodb://from yourMONGO_URL
3 [2017-06-27T23:28:52] <SISheogorath> and maybe also drop the port
4 [2017-06-27T23:30:05] <SISheogorath> In general it's more a issue of the library than a docker problem so please consider to ask in a golang related channel for further help
5 [2017-06-28T07:27:36] <SISheogorath> Ynes: since matrix has a bit ugly linking I can't say what you are referring to :/
6 [2017-06-28T07:28:08] <SISheogorath> k2levin: depends on what you are about to use
7 [2017-06-28T08:38:58] <SISheogorath> k2levin: what are you about to do? Publish it or only use it in your defined environment?
8 [2017-06-28T08:39:31] <SISheogorath> The main reason to use older composefile versions is to stay compatible with olderdocker-composeversions
9 [2017-06-28T08:40:45] <SISheogorath> so if you are sure that all people and systems which should use this file are up-to-date then you can use the latest version, for publishing for example I still stick with version  if possible, because there are still systems out there that use docker-compose 1.9 or earlier
10 [2017-06-28T08:42:05] <SISheogorath> Same applies for docker stack of course. I'm not sure if 17.03 already supports newer versions than3.0
11 [2017-06-28T10:26:41] <SISheogorath> Are you on Windows?
12 [2017-06-28T10:28:05] <SISheogorath> in general it's not possible to use normal host directories as named volumes. On linux there is volume driver to do something similar. For Windows I can't say anything specific

I’ve configured a swarm but every time a windows/mac machine joins the swarm I get the hostname to bemobybut on my other machines I get it’s own hostname.

2 [2017-06-28T10:32:36] <k2levin> for people who using v3, then many features have to be deprecated
3 [2017-06-28T10:33:22] <SISheogorath> k2levin: yes, there applies the same. if you can make sure that all hosts where you want to use it support 3.2 then go for 3.2 but that highly depends on your environment. If it's not the case you have to update your hosts or use the older format like 3.0

11 [2017-06-29T22:58:49] <jbelmont> I am running on MacOS
12 [2017-06-29T22:58:58] <SISheogorath> In this case:WARNING (Windows & OS X): The default Docker setup on Windows and OS X uses a VirtualBox VM to host the Docker daemon. Unfortunately, the mechanism VirtualBox uses to share folders between the host system and the Docker container is not compatible with the memory mapped files used by MongoDB (see vbox bug, docs.mongodb.org and related jira.mongodb.org bug). This means that it is not possible to run a MongoDB container with the data directory mapped to the host.

15 [2017-06-29T23:00:27] <SISheogorath> I'm not completely sure that's still true with docker for Mac as it no longer uses Virtualbox (iirc), but I can't say for sure so maybe you should check that first
16 [2017-06-29T23:01:17] <jbelmont> ah okay let me check
17 [2017-06-29T23:01:25] <SISheogorath> There are also additional, potential problems like SELinux policy conflicts, ...
18 [2017-06-29T23:58:53] <jbelmont> Yeah I posted this in the google group
19 [2017-06-29T23:59:21] <jbelmont> one thing I can confirm is now is the my mongodb collection is being created in the container I fixed that issue
20 [2017-06-30T00:00:05] <jbelmont> but thendocker-compose up frontend backend db rediswhen all the containers are running the backend container throws error aboutPanic: no reachable servers
21 [2017-06-30T00:06:33] <jbelmont> one thing I can’t figure out is why the container isn’t running with webpack though it was running fine before
22 [2017-06-30T00:13:16] <jbelmont> I changed it back to ports: “3000:8080” and app runs again but still the message Panic: no reachable servers
23 [2017-06-30T01:18:21] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: sounds like a problem with your kernel, check the kernel log for more details and maybe report it to the debian maintainers. They should be able to solve and fix the problem if it is reproducible.
24 [2017-06-30T01:19:46] <SISheogorath> Wait
25 [2017-06-30T01:20:47] <SISheogorath> I just saw "backing Filesystem: unknown" please open a bug for it on [<-LINK->]
26 [2017-06-30T01:34:17] <gdeverlant> I did put this in daemon.json

28 [2017-06-30T01:35:14] <SISheogorath> Why?
29 [2017-06-30T01:35:21] <gdeverlant> and now I get this error

32 [2017-06-30T01:37:13] <gdeverlant> I have 2 identical arm64 board with the same OS
33 [2017-06-30T01:37:24] <gdeverlant> the other board shows this

35 [2017-06-30T01:37:47] <gdeverlant> the only difference between the 2 board is that
36 [2017-06-30T01:38:19] <gdeverlant> I moved the /var/lib/docker folder on a external usb HD with the 1st board
37 [2017-06-30T01:38:54] <gdeverlant> and didn't changed the 2nd board
38 [2017-06-30T01:38:54] <SISheogorath> That's the problem
39 [2017-06-30T01:39:11] <SISheogorath> What file system do you use on the hdd
40 [2017-06-30T01:39:16] <gdeverlant> ext4

42 [2017-06-30T01:39:46] <SISheogorath> On the external hdd?
43 [2017-06-30T01:39:55] <gdeverlant> how do i check that
44 [2017-06-30T01:40:09] <gdeverlant> I'm not 100% sure
45 [2017-06-30T01:40:51] <SISheogorath> df -Tshould work

47 [2017-06-30T01:41:36] <gdeverlant> can it be that
48 [2017-06-30T01:41:52] <gdeverlant> I mounted the external HD in /mnt/seagate-1TB-01
49 [2017-06-30T01:42:13] <SISheogorath> Yes, that's the problem
50 [2017-06-30T01:42:14] <gdeverlant> and then I made a mhddfs fuse mount
51 [2017-06-30T01:42:45] <SISheogorath> overlay2 only works on ext4 and xfs
52 [2017-06-30T01:43:06] <gdeverlant> how can I make sure that it works with mhddfs
53 [2017-06-30T01:43:34] <SISheogorath> It can't
54 [2017-06-30T01:43:35] <gdeverlant> in the future i'm planning to add 3 more HD
55 [2017-06-30T01:44:14] <gdeverlant> ok so it' better to just move the path from /mnt/virtual to /mnt/seagate-1TB-01
56 [2017-06-30T01:44:19] <gdeverlant> for the graph mapping

59 [2017-06-30T01:45:27] <SISheogorath> Won't work because it's vfat
60 [2017-06-30T01:45:40] <SISheogorath> Not ext4 or xfs
61 [2017-06-30T01:45:50] <gdeverlant> no it's not vfat
62 [2017-06-30T01:46:02] <gdeverlant> the boot partition is vfat but the os is on ext4
63 [2017-06-30T01:46:12] <gdeverlant> both are on the usd card

69 [2017-06-30T01:47:37] <gdeverlant> shit it means I can't use mhddfs
70 [2017-06-30T01:47:55] <gdeverlant> previously it worked with AUFS
71 [2017-06-30T01:48:17] <gdeverlant> but I upgraded the kernel to mainline 4.12-rc7
72 [2017-06-30T01:48:49] <gdeverlant> now I need to change everything
73 [2017-06-30T01:49:34] <SISheogorath> Good luck :) You'll make it ;) have to sleep now

2 [2017-06-30T08:20:19] <pjetr> The creator of this file has a container to mount volumes in, and share those to hir other containers.
3 [2017-06-30T08:20:48] <pjetr> why? What is the reason for doing so?
4 [2017-06-30T08:23:15] <pjetr> and one more, why would this [<-LINK->] be a good idea?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-30T09:30:11] <SISheogorath> It's mainly to fix permissions of newly added files

1 [2017-06-30T15:52:06] <tuan3w> Hi everyone,I have an question about docker swarm and would love to hear your advices. I'm building a web service and deploying it on a swarm. Since the docker swarm mode has a built in routing mesh, what nodes in swarm we should request to? As I notice, if I request to only one node, the network throughput in that node will go much higher compare with other nodes. I think the reason is that node will receive all network request to it and forward to other nodes in the swarm. If my understanding is correct, so what is the best way to deal with  network unbalanced problem?I have to request roundrobin manually to every nodes in the swarm.\nI will use a proxy that connect to every nodes in the swarm.Or any better way ?Thanks
2 [2017-07-01T02:01:11] <tuan3w> SISheogorath: : As I seen in Ganglia, the network in the node that I connect to goes much higher than in  other nodes (100Mb/s while other only go upto ~7Mbs/s). My swarm consists of 6 cloud nodes (8core, 32G). I changed number of replications from 2 to 4 and still got the same effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-30T20:20:24] <SISheogorath> tuan3w: it's a pretty simply calculation: What amount of traffic do you think you get? If it's to much for one host, think about RR with up to 4 hosts. If it becomes more, think about external load balancers. Many CDN providers also offer external load balancing.
2 [2017-06-30T20:22:20] <SISheogorath> aaronbeall: do you need it in detail? if you want to programm something like libcompose is maybe the better address
3 [2017-06-30T20:32:21] <SISheogorath> devalexandre: What docker version are you running? Worked in my test setup. There was a basic problem with the container itself, based on the fact, that my mounted directory is empty, but in general it worked. Maybe you can provide some more details
4 [2017-07-01T01:26:40] <SISheogorath> SD cards aren't made for many writes. So I would say running docker on them is not very reliable, but fine, if you have to and don't replace your images and containers too frequently. Developing in an SD card is a bad idea, as you will write over and over again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-30T20:52:53] <aaronbeall> SISheogorath: Interesting, didn't know aboutlibcompose, that sounds useful but I'm no using Go, I'm using NodeJS... it would also be a pretty big refactor, as I'm working with a lot of existing code that usesdocker-compose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-06-30T23:50:21] <karneaud> I\'m using docker a lot for development locally but its beginning to affect storage space. Because of this I\'ve resorted to running docker projects on a 60G sdcard. But of late I keep running into a lot of "ready system only" failures and inability to remove volumes and images sometimes. This eventually leads me to keep reformatting the card overtime. Is running docker on SDCARDS a good idea?
2 [2017-07-01T14:24:55] <karneaud> gdeverlant: thanks. I have a 700G WD external drive. I moved it across. Its just that is cumbersome to move around with it sometimes( even though its a passport)

4 [2017-07-01T14:25:37] <karneaud> but I'm getting so confused on how to setup up permissions so containers can manipulate the files being used on the volume.....
5 [2017-07-01T14:25:51] <karneaud> How should my permissions be setup
6 [2017-07-01T14:25:52] <karneaud> ?
7 [2017-07-01T14:26:02] <karneaud> SISheogorath: @gdeverlant
8 [2017-07-01T15:37:53] <karneaud> thanks but would this work on "named volumes"@SISheogorath??
9 [2017-07-01T15:38:03] <karneaud> I'm confused as to how permissions are set to it
10 [2017-07-01T16:13:14] <karneaud> ok cool
11 [2017-07-01T16:13:31] <karneaud> trying to do some workarounds but I'm getting something weird here
12 [2017-07-01T16:14:02] <karneaud> why would a ./wordpress/wp-config.php:/var/www/html/wp-config.php try to load it as a directory and not a file?
13 [2017-07-01T16:14:42] <karneaud> Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type
14 [2017-07-01T16:15:03] <karneaud> I've used docker before and it has mounted files as volumes already
15 [2017-07-01T16:15:31] <karneaud> matter of fact I have ./install.sh:/var/www/install.sh as a volume and I get no quams
16 [2017-07-01T16:15:34] <karneaud> what gives?
17 [2017-07-01T16:33:56] <karneaud> I can't get it to work
18 [2017-07-01T16:38:24] <karneaud> i tried [<-CODE->] Tried setting the composer to [<-CODE->]
19 [2017-07-01T16:38:46] <karneaud> Still nothing CAN permissions on named volumes be done in the first place?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-01T09:16:16] <gdeverlant> you should use an external HD and move your /var/lib/docker folder to /mnt/your-drive/var/lib/docker
2 [2017-07-01T09:16:52] <gdeverlant> I get 25 to 30 MB/s throughput with an arm64 device on my network
3 [2017-07-01T09:17:27] <gdeverlant> running with a micro SD boot root
4 [2017-07-01T15:05:03] <gdeverlant> try sudo touch yourfilename
5 [2017-07-01T15:05:26] <gdeverlant> you can also change the permission on any file with
6 [2017-07-01T15:05:35] <gdeverlant> sudo chmod 777 yourfilename
7 [2017-07-01T15:05:50] <gdeverlant> it gives acces to read and write to everyone
8 [2017-07-01T15:26:16] <SISheogorath> That's a very bad idea ._.
9 [2017-07-01T15:26:32] <SISheogorath> there is (almost) no reason to set 777 to anything
10 [2017-07-01T15:28:08] <SISheogorath> If you want to share/write to data with multiple parties, the same that applies outside of docker, applies to inside docker: Make sure you setup a group that all users share and make the files writeable to this group. NOT TO EVERYONE
11 [2017-07-01T15:43:05] <SISheogorath> the easiest way is to set fixed uids and gids for images, but you have to check that these images support it
12 [2017-07-01T15:46:47] <karneaud> this is harder than I thought it would be
13 [2017-07-01T15:54:29] <SISheogorath> Well, Docker makes a lot of things easy, but is still mostly a wrapper around the linux kernel, so you have to follow the rules of the linux kernel. Many people tend to forget it. If you have a problem while creating or start a container, it's possibly related to docker. But almost everything that happens INSIDE your container, is only related to the kernel. So at the end of the day docker sends you all the way down inside classic kernel rulesets.
14 [2017-07-02T01:37:30] <SISheogorath> dthree: you should use docker networking. You can simply use their names ^^
15 [2017-07-02T01:38:27] <SISheogorath> actually not even a need to expose them on the host if you loadbalance inside a container. hint: If you want to automate the reverse proxy setup: Checkout out Traefik
16 [2017-07-02T01:38:49] <dthree> kk thanks will check
17 [2017-07-02T14:04:27] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: yes.

1 [2017-07-01T23:41:35] <karneaud> has anyone ever worked with browser sync and docker volumes?
2 [2017-07-01T23:42:09] <karneaud> I've setup a browser sync + web pack workflow where files updated trigger reloading of the browser
3 [2017-07-01T23:42:46] <karneaud> when I update the file from host I can see the changes in the container but browser sync doesn't realod
4 [2017-07-01T23:43:34] <dthree> I have an NGINX docker container, and 16 load balanced web servers each exposing a port on the host machine, 8081-8096.
5 [2017-07-01T23:43:35] <karneaud> However if I update the changes from within the container I can see the changes on both sides and browser sync reload is triggered
6 [2017-07-01T23:43:54] <dthree> How do I allow the Nginx container to talk to each of them? I don't want to make 16 links!
7 [2017-07-01T23:43:58] <dthree> What's the standard way to do this?

1 [2017-07-03T13:10:14] <icehaunter> Hey guys. Could you please help me with organising my docker-compose file in terms of networking? I have a nodejs server-rendered SPA, python backend, database and, I guess, nginx to distribute requests to statics, uploads and such. I am having problems with server rendering: if point SPA to make requests tonginxinstead of localhost IP, serverside rendering works, but in-browser requests don\'t, because the browser does not know about nginx address. If I point to localhost, serverside rendering does not work, because node is on a different host, I guess, to the backend. Is there a way around this without using docker network mode:host(as it "pollutes" ports on the machine)? Thanks in advance.
2 [2017-07-03T13:25:44] <icehaunter> SISheogorath: could you explain?
3 [2017-07-03T14:03:37] <icehaunter> SISheogorath: Do you mean setting up reverse proxy on the dev machine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-03T13:25:16] <SISheogorath> Use a reverse proxy?
2 [2017-07-03T13:45:43] <SISheogorath> Use a reverse proxy that manages all needed connection, like Traefik. Then use the "published" names of your containers to talk to them
3 [2017-07-03T15:23:48] <SISheogorath> icehaunter: You can simply add it to your general setup
4 [2017-07-03T15:24:47] <SISheogorath> yudilevi: you don't change into the /app directory
5 [2017-07-03T15:25:07] <SISheogorath> so you won't find the package.json

5 [2017-07-03T15:26:53] <yudilevi> Thanks, will try that
6 [2017-07-03T15:28:02] <yudilevi> Sorry, no - I still don't get it, I do copy all files into the /app folder (including the package.json file)
7 [2017-07-03T15:28:55] <yudilevi> Do I actually need to manually change into the /app folder? Isn't setting the workdir to /app do that?
8 [2017-07-03T15:52:33] <yudilevi> Np :) Any other idea?
9 [2017-07-03T15:53:02] <SISheogorath> Can you copy your stuff first into /app and then change to it?
10 [2017-07-03T15:53:17] <icehaunter> SISheogorath: , sorry, I still don't get it
11 [2017-07-03T15:53:19] <SISheogorath> I'm not sure if it exists when you change to it and if that works
12 [2017-07-03T15:56:19] <SISheogorath> icehaunter: well, as far as I understand your problem is that you have to use the same network name for your backend as you request to work with server-side rendering. So a possible solution for it is: 1. Define a network alias 2. Use a reverse proxy

1 [2017-07-04T09:57:38] <karneaud> Hey guys has anyone any experience with docker and azure? I have a current docker compose wordpress project and would like to deploy on azure...do I need to redo my docker project or can I just add a azure container to the current project?
2 [2017-07-04T10:54:54] <karneaud> think you answered a bit of your question yourself if you read the last part of your comment in brackets@orangelynx
3 [2017-07-04T11:03:44] <SISheogorath> orangelynx: in general you should no longer use  the--link. Use normal networking instead.
4 [2017-07-04T11:04:05] <SISheogorath> And when you use regular networking it becomes clear why you split it up into different container.
5 [2017-07-04T11:04:57] <SISheogorath> If you have one instance and it becomes too slow you simply setup another instance of your container instead of move it to a more performant server
6 [2017-07-04T11:05:11] <SISheogorath> and this works way more generic than a scale up
7 [2017-07-04T11:05:23] <SISheogorath> and is still optimized for ressource usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T10:16:41] <nonsense> if anyone has the same problem - I had to change driver from auft to overlay2 in/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/10-machine.confand start manually the service. the change was somehow introduced from 17.05 to 17.06 , but I couldn't find a binary to revert back to 17.05 to confirm it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T10:42:38] <orangelynx> Hi everyone! I spent my last two days reading about docker and its concepts, but there's one thing I don't quite get: Take the example of nginx and php-fpm. Each comes in its own container and you would use docker-compose and link to make them work together. but both still have some redundant common base, e.g. alpine, even though they compose a service together. Why is the common way of doing things to link two independent containers instead of creating one container that contains both nginx and php (which would have less overhead, and possibly be more performant).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T13:05:51] <przemolb> Hi everyone ! What do you guys use as a internal docker registry ?
2 [2017-07-04T13:06:41] <przemolb> (I mean not cloud based - it must be on-prem)
3 [2017-07-04T13:07:22] <carljmosca> artifactory
4 [2017-07-04T13:09:01] <przemolb> I am looking for something which also in the future could be integrated with Active Directory
5 [2017-07-04T13:09:32] <carljmosca>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-07-04T13:12:12] <przemolb> is there any non-commercial version to try out ? I am trying to prepare some POC environment so would like to do that cost-free
7 [2017-07-04T13:12:58] <carljmosca> we have been using Artifactory for several years now initially for maven but it has been great for docker and yum as well
8 [2017-07-04T13:13:32] <carljmosca> you could try nexus but we had an issue with the way they secure docker registries
9 [2017-07-04T13:14:18] <carljmosca>  [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-07-04T13:16:19] <przemolb> Thanks@carljmosca:-)
11 [2017-07-04T13:16:31] <carljmosca> very welcome…hope it helps
12 [2017-07-04T13:16:48] <przemolb> I did quick research before going to this forum and found there are quite a few
13 [2017-07-04T13:17:13] <przemolb> pre-selected harbor  (from vmware) and the one from docker
14 [2017-07-04T13:17:42] <przemolb> but doesn't know about anything about how they behave in production environment etc
15 [2017-07-04T13:18:01] <carljmosca> not tried either of those on-prem
16 [2017-07-04T13:18:13] <przemolb> did you use any another else except this artifactory  ?
17 [2017-07-04T13:18:54] <carljmosca> gitlab and nexus and we have OpenShift’s registry exposed but only the former in production
18 [2017-07-04T13:19:58] <carljmosca> I really like the UI and setup for Artifactory (I don’t now and never have worked for them but it really is nice) :)
19 [2017-07-04T13:25:42] <przemolb> Thanks again@carljmosca!  :-)
20 [2017-07-04T13:26:30] <carljmosca> przemolb: you’re welcome - let us know how it works out :)
21 [2017-07-04T13:29:03] <przemolb> It's gonna take some time to have some results ;-)
22 [2017-07-04T13:30:02] <carljmosca> but things are changing so fast in the Docker space right now I am sure your findings will be helpful to someone…good luck

1 [2017-07-04T18:19:51] <JnMik> Hello guys, I\'m using Docker swarm and I was wondering if there is anything available to deploy a bunch on containers, but never have  two containers of the same image on the same host ? Something like a constraint "Unique on host"
2 [2017-07-04T18:20:38] <JnMik> I have a scenario with a cluster of  3 cassandras with a Quorum of 2, And I want to avoid dealing with a failure because a docker node failed and I had 2 cassandra containers on that specific node
3 [2017-07-04T18:21:03] <JnMik> And it feels like overkill  to deal with tagging  labels on all nodes for that kind of dispatch needs
4 [2017-07-04T18:26:41] <JnMik> Well I thought about it at first, but I have 4 available nodes
5 [2017-07-04T18:26:46] <JnMik> I don't want 4 cassandra nodes
6 [2017-07-04T18:27:02] <JnMik> Because I won't be able to specify a Quorum (total / 2 + 1)
7 [2017-07-04T18:27:31] <JnMik> Also, I don't want my cassandra cluster to expand as I expand my docker cluster
8 [2017-07-04T18:28:16] <JnMik> The day I will need 20 docker nodes, I will have a major ressources waste running 20 cassandra containers at minimum 4GB of RAM each
9 [2017-07-04T18:28:30] <JnMik> and that\'s the requirement for a "dev" setup lol
10 [2017-07-04T18:28:58] <JnMik> Could you be more specific ?
11 [2017-07-04T18:29:15] <JnMik> 3 cassandra containers as a cluster, replication factor of 3, Quorum of 2
12 [2017-07-04T18:31:09] <JnMik> At first I investigate if I could use labels for grouping docker nodesgroup-cassandra [<-ISSUE->] (docker node 1 and 2)group-cassandra [<-ISSUE->] (docker node 2 and 3)group-cassandra [<-ISSUE->] (docker node 3 and 4)But I could endup with 2 cassandra containers on docker node 2 and 3
13 [2017-07-04T18:31:48] <JnMik> and if I label my docker nodes with singularitynode [<-ISSUE->] = cassandra-label1node [<-ISSUE->] = cassandra-label2node [<-ISSUE->] = cassandra-label3node [<-ISSUE->] = no label, go to waste ?
14 [2017-07-04T18:32:05] <JnMik> So it's not really what I am looking for
15 [2017-07-04T18:32:25] <JnMik> I want my cassandra to be able to deploy on any docker nodes, without having 2 containers on the same node.
16 [2017-07-04T18:32:32] <arunkumar-patange>  [<-ISSUE->] still open
17 [2017-07-04T18:33:01] <JnMik> nice found
18 [2017-07-04T18:33:47] <arunkumar-patange> Exposing port might be a workaround, haven't tried it myself
19 [2017-07-04T18:36:18] <JnMik> Reading the comments atm, I don't understand your port exposing workaround for now
20 [2017-07-04T18:55:22] <JnMik> Oh
21 [2017-07-04T18:55:26] <JnMik> look what I found
22 [2017-07-04T18:55:29] <JnMik>  [<-LINK->]
23 [2017-07-04T18:55:36] <JnMik> High availability
24 [2017-07-04T18:56:57] <JnMik> Not sure how to specify it in my service .yml file tho
25 [2017-07-04T18:58:31] <arunkumar-patange> Looks like this is only in docker cloud offering
26 [2017-07-04T18:58:37] <JnMik> yuppp :(
27 [2017-07-04T18:59:41] <arunkumar-patange> Yeah if you are running your own swarm, then deploy labels would be a w
28 [2017-07-04T18:59:54] <arunkumar-patange> ay to go for now
29 [2017-07-04T19:01:21] <JnMik> Bouhouh
30 [2017-07-04T19:12:08] <JnMik> My last hope is destroyed, label it's gonna be xD
31 [2017-07-04T19:12:29] <JnMik> Now I have a sysadmin to convince
32 [2017-07-04T19:12:33] <JnMik> Wish me luck

1 [2017-07-04T18:28:50] <JinnaBalu> how are you running cassandra?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T19:02:42] <SISheogorath> aaronmcadam: currently not possible.  You can pass it to the build process byARG, but not by read it from a file inside your container
2 [2017-07-04T19:04:35] <SISheogorath> JnMik: yesm you have to way until custom deployment strategies exist :/ currently it's a bit limited
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T19:13:45] <JinnaBalu> JnMik: i need your help if you success i need to run cassandra in three machines connecting to the same cluster please help me with the docker commands to run.
2 [2017-07-04T19:39:02] <JinnaBalu> Currently I am running Single node cluster, in one machine
3 [2017-07-04T19:39:38] <JinnaBalu> I want to run with multinode in three different machine, One node will be the contact point for my application \\
4 [2017-07-04T19:40:02] <JinnaBalu> i need to configure this on three different machines what is the right way to achieve this
5 [2017-07-04T19:40:56] <JnMik> One node will be the contact point for your application ? By saying that, I suspect your are running 3 docker nodes, but not in cluster, correct ?
6 [2017-07-04T19:41:12] <JnMik> Because with Docker swarm, or kubernetes, your contact points would be the Service name / service IP
7 [2017-07-04T19:41:42] <JnMik> Which kinda have the "load balancer" role for your 3 replicas behind it
8 [2017-07-04T19:43:42] <JnMik> Well, I might be wrong on this. The service name might only be good using internally
9 [2017-07-04T19:44:16] <JnMik> But if you have a load balancer in front on your cluster, you could add the 3 nodes entry in it , they should all exposed the same port
10 [2017-07-04T19:44:36] <JinnaBalu> i have three servers is that possible to join these servers in docker swarm
11 [2017-07-04T19:44:56] <JnMik> Yup probably should, swarm is easy to use
12 [2017-07-04T19:45:01] <JinnaBalu> Service Ip wil be the contact point
13 [2017-07-04T19:45:23] <JnMik> Look for the "Swarm init" and "swarm join" command
14 [2017-07-04T19:45:24] <JinnaBalu> Can you please give me the docker commands to run run on different machine
15 [2017-07-04T19:45:45] <JnMik> You should go through the documentation anyway
16 [2017-07-04T19:45:47] <JinnaBalu> Will that join the server or only it joins the VMs?
17 [2017-07-04T19:45:48] <JnMik> To have the big picture
18 [2017-07-04T19:46:11] <JnMik> What'S the difference between your servers and yours VMs?
19 [2017-07-04T19:46:17] <JnMik> Not sure I picture them clearly lol
20 [2017-07-04T19:46:43] <JinnaBalu> VM and host are different right
21 [2017-07-04T19:46:59] <JnMik> lol it depends :P
22 [2017-07-04T19:47:12] <JnMik> Your docker nodes runs in VM ? Or directly on the machines/host ?
23 [2017-07-04T19:47:39] <JinnaBalu> I have three different host machines, is it possible to joint host together to work with swwarm
24 [2017-07-04T19:48:19] <JnMik> You want to run VMs AND Containers on the same host ?
25 [2017-07-04T19:48:34] <JnMik> I don't think you should
26 [2017-07-04T19:48:38] <JnMik> lol
27 [2017-07-04T19:48:49] <JinnaBalu> do run docker sarm we creates docker machines right, in my case machines are not created by docker they are preinstalled with ubuntu and ready to use for deployment
28 [2017-07-04T19:49:09] <JinnaBalu> I want them to run in swarm mode will that be a possibl case?
29 [2017-07-04T19:50:24] <JnMik> Well, if it can help,   In your situation I would have 3 machines/hosts with centos as OS and docker-engine installed directly on the host (No docker machines VMs at all)
30 [2017-07-04T19:50:29] <JnMik> But that's me lol
31 [2017-07-04T19:50:44] <JinnaBalu> I have worked with creqating docker machines and worked with the swarm too, there i have created VMs with some drivers. but the case is different. I have servers ready, which are not VMs.
32 [2017-07-04T19:51:35] <JinnaBalu> JnMik: can you tell me and give me the docker commands how you configured, if you have time
33 [2017-07-04T19:52:07] <JnMik> Well you could install Docker directly on the host, no need for docker machines VMs
34 [2017-07-04T19:52:27] <JnMik> On ubuntu, I guess that would be apt-get install docker-engine
35 [2017-07-04T19:52:31] <JinnaBalu> Yes
36 [2017-07-04T19:52:44] <JnMik> then, check the swarm doc :P
37 [2017-07-04T19:53:03] <JnMik> But mostly your main target is to achieve "swarm init" and "swarm join"
38 [2017-07-04T19:53:32] <JnMik> oh :) Sorry about that then lol
39 [2017-07-04T19:53:45] <JinnaBalu> that i can do, how to configure Cassandra, on three machines and give one machine as the contact point, if one machines fails I have other node in two machines
40 [2017-07-04T19:54:06] <JnMik> One of your 3 nodes will be a scheduler, 2 others will have containers (I don't recommand having containers on your scheduler, so maybe you would need 4 docker nodes)
41 [2017-07-04T19:54:36] <JnMik> Then once you have the scheduler ready, you\'ll start playing with docker commands like "docker service ls",  "docker service create"  etc
42 [2017-07-04T19:54:46] <JnMik> Then you'll discover the magic of docker swarm
43 [2017-07-04T19:54:50] <JnMik> lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T19:37:51] <JnMik> Well I do have my cassandra cluster running at the moment, healthy and everything
2 [2017-07-04T19:37:57] <JnMik> What's the issue with yours ?
3 [2017-07-04T19:38:18] <JnMik> The only thing left to solve in my setup is the deployment strategy for 1 container per node
4 [2017-07-04T19:38:22] <JnMik> and I'll solve it with labels.
5 [2017-07-04T19:38:30] <JnMik> sysadmin convinced... !
6 [2017-07-04T19:38:42] <JnMik> Well, not really but he gave me the "go" to test it in our developement environement lol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T19:49:12] <SISheogorath> JinnaBalu: got with it step by step, learn how docker engine and docker swarm-mode work
2 [2017-07-04T19:49:16] <SISheogorath> then create one
3 [2017-07-04T19:49:50] <SISheogorath> check out the guides at [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-07-04T19:50:37] <SISheogorath> Once you know how to use it and how it works (which includes some additional research in the docker docs and linux kernel manuals), you should go for it
5 [2017-07-04T19:51:26] <SISheogorath> if you don't know how docker and docker-swarm-mode work you will run in more trouble than you solve with it
6 [2017-07-04T19:53:19] <SISheogorath> JnMik: no longerdocker-engine:D it'sdocker-ceif you go for something more up-to-date
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T19:55:22] <JinnaBalu> Do you have any documentation on running cassandra? with multi node cluster on different machines?
2 [2017-07-04T19:56:14] <SISheogorath> JinnaBalu: there is no "use these 3 commands and a cassandra cluster without problems will appear on your machines"-documentation
3 [2017-07-04T19:56:21] <JnMik> ahaha
4 [2017-07-04T19:56:56] <SISheogorath> You have to K N O W docker, as well as cassandra, etc. otherwise you'll shoot yourself
5 [2017-07-04T19:57:10] <JnMik> Yeah, and you'll have some issues on the way
6 [2017-07-04T19:57:13] <JnMik> like
7 [2017-07-04T19:57:19] <JnMik>  [<-LINK->]

10 [2017-07-04T19:57:38] <JinnaBalu> @JinnaBalu there is no "use these 3 commands and a cassandra cluster without problems will appear on your machines"-documentation I know this
11 [2017-07-04T19:57:46] <JnMik> To be able to have your cassandra node rejoin the cluster automatically on failure :P
12 [2017-07-04T19:58:47] <JinnaBalu> Currently i am running in one node cluster. But want to replicate it on differnet machines whoch is different case, we need to hav link between the nodes in a cluster right, how do we do that was my question.
13 [2017-07-04T19:59:24] <SISheogorath> JinnaBalu: as always: First ask the question, how you would do it without docker
14 [2017-07-04T20:00:34] <SISheogorath> when you know how to do outside of docker, then you can do it inside docker as well. Docker is only the automated way to do it.
15 [2017-07-04T20:00:53] <JinnaBalu> SISheogorath: do you have the answer? with docker or without docker both are not so different, instead of installing cassnadra on hst we run on docker
16 [2017-07-04T20:00:53] <SISheogorath> the knowledge about how to do things must still exist in your head
17 [2017-07-04T20:01:20] <JinnaBalu> the knowledge about how to do things must still exist in your head Yes this is missing
18 [2017-07-04T20:01:37] <JinnaBalu> If you have answer pplease let me know
19 [2017-07-04T20:02:18] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] <-- here you go
20 [2017-07-04T20:02:36] <SISheogorath> but actually I'm not a cassandra user so not sure if it's still up-to-date :D
21 [2017-07-04T20:02:49] <JnMik> jbalu and if you setup cassandra with 3 nodes, I suggest you might want to use Quorum of 2
22 [2017-07-04T20:03:02] <JnMik> And if you don't store too much data.. replication factor of 3 might be good for your case
23 [2017-07-04T20:03:18] <JnMik> Would allow you to have 2 nodes down without losing data.
24 [2017-07-04T20:03:20] <SISheogorath> Maybe it's better to go here: [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-07-04T20:05:08] <SISheogorath> Since it's java I try to stay away from it as far as possible
26 [2017-07-04T20:05:44] <JnMik> xD
27 [2017-07-04T20:05:47] <JnMik> Greedy on ressources
28 [2017-07-04T20:05:53] <JnMik> minimum specs for a dev node : 4GB
29 [2017-07-04T20:06:01] <JnMik> insane
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-04T20:06:07] <JinnaBalu> JnMik: points to benoted. Quorum is new to me. If you have any docker commands or docker compose for cassnadra please send the configuration
2 [2017-07-04T20:07:31] <JinnaBalu> I have currently having 32 gb 3 server, i'll run elastic search and cassandra in two machines , application and cassnadra on one machine, I will run application with docker stack deploy or docker compose.
3 [2017-07-04T20:07:46] <JnMik> Well it's complicated to share, I have business stuff in it I might not want to share, and anyway I don't use docker-compose.yml for swarm, I generate .yml file for Docker swarm service through ansible
4 [2017-07-04T20:07:51] <JnMik> This might not be what you're looking for.
5 [2017-07-04T20:08:00] <JnMik> Why don'T you experiment
6 [2017-07-04T20:08:04] <JnMik> and ask specific questions anyway ?
7 [2017-07-04T20:08:23] <SISheogorath> take the official cassandra images' long description about building a cluster [<-LINK->]
8 [2017-07-04T20:08:41] <SISheogorath> but as I mentioned if you don't know cassandra and docker really good you'll only shoot yourself
9 [2017-07-04T20:09:14] <JinnaBalu> I want to experiment, but if you have so that would save my day. Anyways I go nice inputs to work on from@JnMikand@SISheogorath
10 [2017-07-04T20:10:01] <JnMik> Well as said earlier, try to make your swarm cluster work first,then try to deploy a cassandra in it
11 [2017-07-04T20:10:07] <JinnaBalu> but as I mentioned if you don't know cassandra and docker really good you'll only shoot yourselfI have deployed my application with single node cluster using docker with Jenkins pipeline.
12 [2017-07-04T20:10:11] <JnMik> Questions will come along the way lol
13 [2017-07-04T20:11:20] <JinnaBalu> I need to find out the solution on connecting two nodes, seed ip/ contact point . I need to get clarity here
14 [2017-07-04T20:12:16] <JnMik> You can pass environment variables to cassandra containers
15 [2017-07-04T20:12:43] <JnMik> Exemple environment variable for cassandra container 1CASSANDRA_SEEDS: cassandra-peer1, cassandra-peer2,cassandra-peer3CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS: cassandra-peer1CASSANDRA_ENDPOINT_SNITCH: GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
16 [2017-07-04T20:14:29] <JnMik> Replication factor and consistency would be defined during migration (schema creation) / on the application level
17 [2017-07-04T20:21:40] <JnMik> cassandra-peerX would be my swarm internal service name, it's usable like an hostname/ IP address inside the containers which share the same docker network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-05T02:26:20] <sabrehagen> Hi all, whenever I rebuild my container, it always build from scratch even though I only change a file that's ADDed in the last step. I believe it's theRUN apk updatecommand I use that stops the cached image version from being used. Does RUN invalidate the cache? How can I make it so I don't have to rebuild from scratch?
2 [2017-07-05T02:26:29] <sabrehagen> here's my Dockerfile [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-07-05T02:38:35] <jordan-green> I think it will always check for updates
4 [2017-07-05T02:38:56] <jordan-green> And as a result will rebuild the image from there@sabrehagen
5 [2017-07-05T02:39:34] <jordan-green> If your other commands aren't reliant on a system update try moving it toward the end of your file to speed up your iterative builds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-05T07:21:01] <SISheogorath> sabrehagen: It shouldn't invalidate that caching layer if you haven't changed that line. What docker version are you running and what command do you use to build your image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T07:51:33] <mikeleg> is possible to export in a package a docker_compose result
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T12:33:53] <basz> Hi I’m struggling a bit to ask the correct questions: given a swarm ready to accept stacks. I see a stack as a collection of services an application needs. But some services like ngix are required by multiple applications and that would mean multiple running ngix services, which doesn’t seem al that efficient… How do you handle this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T14:17:02] <gdeverlant> greetings agaain dockrians
2 [2017-07-06T14:17:35] <gdeverlant> I would like to know if it is possible to trigger the execution of a script outside of the dockerization proces
3 [2017-07-06T14:17:49] <gdeverlant> during the dockerization of a Dockerfile
4 [2017-07-06T14:24:36] <gdeverlant> any clue ?
5 [2017-07-06T15:08:41] <gdeverlant> is there a way for a stack deploy before a service gets deployed
6 [2017-07-06T15:09:04] <gdeverlant> that a script is runned and then after the service is created ?
7 [2017-07-06T15:39:41] <gdeverlant> Yes I want to run the  script on each nodes of the swarm@JnMik
8 [2017-07-06T15:40:00] <gdeverlant> but I don't want to use external tools
9 [2017-07-06T16:08:10] <gdeverlant> I need the script to do some stuffs on each node to prepare a static config file for each instance
10 [2017-07-06T16:08:44] <gdeverlant> all independently from one another
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T14:18:43] <JinnaBalu> how to create angular-cli application docker image?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T15:15:50] <JnMik> gdeverlant: You want the script to run on the hosts?
2 [2017-07-06T15:18:21] <JnMik> Maybe you should check Ansible.Ansible would be able to do your pre-docker tasks, launch your docker stack, and do your post-docker tasks (All of that in a proper way, and you'll be able to use versionning for your ansible playbooks etc).
3 [2017-07-06T15:49:37] <JnMik> Well, I don't think the Docker commands are meant to run external scripts on hosts,  I don't think it's possible, and anyway it seems to me like it's not the right tool for the job (my opinion tho !)
4 [2017-07-06T15:50:12] <JnMik> That would be different if your script would run inside a container, but on the hosts.. meh !
5 [2017-07-06T15:50:32] <JnMik> Write a shell script and do "myshellscript.sh && docker stack deploy" :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T17:00:45] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: the answer is no. There is no clean and easy way to achieve this. If you can generate the config file in one or another way do this inside your container, but it\'s currently not possible with docker and docker swarm mode. I know that RedHat\'s Atomic has a "setup" label per image which is (maybe) executed (never really got into this) .
2 [2017-07-06T17:01:12] <SISheogorath> Otherwise@JnMikis right, docker isn't the right tool for that
3 [2017-07-06T17:02:28] <SISheogorath> JinnaBalu: take a look at this example of mine: [<-ISSUE->]
4 [2017-07-06T17:08:57] <SISheogorath> basz: if you serve your application with static files, that are served by nginx you need nginx in this setup to have the complete application. In this case the basic idea is: isolation(security) is more important than Ressource usage. And actually when you add a little bit of magic into your setup the ressource usage of another nginx instance isn't a problem. All in all you win, because when some weird issue causes the nginx instance of application A to crash every 2 seconds, the nginx instance of application B can continue work without a problem. I personally dislike it when stacks come with mapped ports. They should be written there but commented (but that's my personal opinion) because you usually have more than one application on your system (as you already pointed out) and this way you maybe run a reverse proxy like Traefik which handles all the port related things
5 [2017-07-06T17:10:27] <SISheogorath> mikeleg: if you cab explain it a bit more detailed, maybe we can help you. If you think about exporting a docker-compose file with all needed images which is automatically importable, no, doesn't exist right now
6 [2017-07-06T17:10:28] <JnMik> gdeverlant: "I need the script to do some stuffs on each node to prepare a static config file for each instance" I\'ve been doing that for years with ansible, but nowadays with Docker I think the best way is to pass the configs via environment variables
7 [2017-07-06T17:13:58] <JnMik> And if you don't want to expose crucial informations in your web server env variables, you can always transpose Container OS environment variables to a file base config inside  the container,  at startup
8 [2017-07-06T17:14:13] <JnMik> Depending on your language, there is some component out there that will do a clean job
9 [2017-07-06T17:14:15] <JnMik> like : [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-07-06T17:15:15] <basz> SISheogorath: thanks. clarifies. indeed proxy, i use docker-flow-proxy in my swarm before any application
11 [2017-07-06T18:14:27] <SISheogorath> basz: yes, that's the typical way to go. The proxy containers are often included in published Dockerfiles to make sure they work out of the box
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T17:29:00] <gdeverlant> thanx yall

1 [2017-07-06T22:33:49] <juliocanares> hi guys
2 [2017-07-06T22:34:04] <juliocanares> I’ve got a question using docker swarm mode
3 [2017-07-06T22:34:22] <juliocanares> I am currently trying to deploy my swarm with 2 managers
4 [2017-07-06T22:34:41] <juliocanares> I am placing a load balancer in front of those 2 managers
5 [2017-07-06T22:34:49] <juliocanares> production.riqra.comis the dns name of the load balancer
6 [2017-07-06T22:35:17] <juliocanares> Now I need to access these managers from my CI server to deploy services in the swarm cluster
7 [2017-07-06T22:36:34] <juliocanares> so what I will do is to change the host of the docker client to something likedocker -H production.riqra.com:2376
8 [2017-07-06T22:39:50] <juliocanares> when it reachs the hostname the load balancer make its job and select one of the managers and try connect to its daemon through the port2376
9 [2017-07-06T22:40:10] <juliocanares> but I am not getting it working, am I missing something?
10 [2017-07-06T22:40:26] <juliocanares> should I generate differente certificates for each manager?
11 [2017-07-06T22:40:37] <juliocanares> o I can share the same certificate for both of them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-06T23:00:50] <gdeverlant> greetings again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T06:54:18] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: basics in shell programming: put your variables in quotes
2 [2017-07-07T06:59:40] <SISheogorath> juliocanares: first of all: swarm with only 2 managers breaks. Swarm mode uses raft consensus to keep state which needs n+1 nodes where n % 2 = 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T07:22:19] <orhuncirakli> i tried many times to understand what docker is. please tell me if i am wrong
2 [2017-07-07T07:33:55] <orhuncirakli> we are using images as environments like .net or something else and put our app in .net image, so our app runs on every machine same way?
3 [2017-07-07T08:17:16] <orhuncirakli> SISheogorath: so when we run our app on another machine, it runs on same filesystem and settings right? to my understanding, when we run our app in container, docker creates virtual filesystem and arrange settings for this container.
4 [2017-07-07T09:54:28] <orhuncirakli> SISheogorath: no, i have limited experience with unix and linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T07:41:52] <SISheogorath> orhuncirakli: what we basically do, we provide filesystems for an application to run and isolate it. That's an image. To isolate them we use kernel features andmagica working application appears
2 [2017-07-07T07:42:25] <SISheogorath> The image is basically a tared filesystem for your application
3 [2017-07-07T09:27:34] <SISheogorath> orhuncirakli: ever worked in a chroot?

1 [2017-07-07T17:03:55] <imaia> Folks, when does the container gain access to write to a volume?
2 [2017-07-07T17:04:09] <imaia> only after build?
3 [2017-07-07T17:04:52] <imaia> MaxGoh: link your db container into your flask container
4 [2017-07-07T17:05:03] <imaia> and reference your db host as the db container name
5 [2017-07-07T17:05:10] <imaia> are you using docker-compose?
6 [2017-07-07T17:05:12] <MaxGoh> yes

39 [2017-07-07T17:48:37] <MaxGoh> so i add back the port ya

42 [2017-07-07T17:53:24] <imaia> fez build?
43 [2017-07-07T17:53:33] <MaxGoh> fez?
44 [2017-07-07T17:54:56] <imaia> did you build?
45 [2017-07-07T17:55:01] <MaxGoh> yup
46 [2017-07-07T17:55:09] <imaia> fez -> "did you" in portuguese
47 [2017-07-07T17:55:11] <MaxGoh> i’m purely doing docker-compose build right now

50 [2017-07-07T17:55:30] <MaxGoh> i did docker-compose build
51 [2017-07-07T17:55:32] <MaxGoh> is that wrong?
52 [2017-07-07T17:56:03] <imaia> not wrong; up --build does both things; builds and runs your services
53 [2017-07-07T17:56:08] <imaia> just a shortcut
54 [2017-07-07T17:56:11] <MaxGoh> anyway
55 [2017-07-07T17:56:14] <MaxGoh> it didn’t work :(
56 [2017-07-07T17:56:21] <MaxGoh> is it because it’s not connected?
57 [2017-07-07T17:56:25] <MaxGoh> that’s why it’s not found?
58 [2017-07-07T17:56:31] <MaxGoh> should i have some kind of network key value
59 [2017-07-07T17:56:44] <imaia> your  (psycopg2.OperationalError) states that your app cannot see your database
60 [2017-07-07T17:56:53] <MaxGoh> yeah man

70 [2017-07-07T17:58:52] <MaxGoh> is it because of my psql port?

1 [2017-07-07T17:04:25] <MaxGoh> Hey guys! I’m trying to connect my application to PSQL. Using flask
2 [2017-07-07T17:04:32] <MaxGoh> But I’m getting this error

4 [2017-07-07T17:04:42] <MaxGoh> Do I not use localhost when I connect?
5 [2017-07-07T17:05:00] <MaxGoh> how do I do that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T17:56:44] <mahenrique94> Is there someone that set up a node container by connecting mongo on main host ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T18:05:42] <MaxGoh> is it possible to do exec -it in docker-compose?
2 [2017-07-07T18:05:46] <MaxGoh> like i wanna access the shell
3 [2017-07-07T18:08:34] <MaxGoh> kbespalov: but i can’t be running any commands when i use exec am i right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-07T18:08:04] <kbespalov> MaxGoh: you still can use docker exec -it, whether you use compose or not, what a problem?

3 [2017-07-07T18:11:05] <MaxGoh> oh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-08T08:20:50] <Niko-La> can you inspect into a  remote container (something like ssh).  If not how are many companies running webterminal into docker systems ..

1 [2017-07-08T10:05:33] <gdeverlant> Hi dockrians
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-08T12:59:49] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: you have to make it executable >.>
2 [2017-07-08T13:00:00] <SISheogorath> means:chmod +xit
3 [2017-07-08T13:02:37] <SISheogorath> :/ sometimes I'm a bit demotivated to help people who don't even know the UNIX basics... These knowledge and typical mistakes are around for around 50 years (maybe longer) and super well documented on the internet. With and without the docker context. When ever an error appears please simply mark, copy  and paste it to the input line of the search engine of your trust. You will get an answer in 9 out of 10 cases
4 [2017-07-08T13:05:16] <gdeverlant> RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh
5 [2017-07-08T13:05:27] <gdeverlant> this is what is inside of the docker image
6 [2017-07-08T13:05:40] <gdeverlant> I know that and I tried but it didn't work already
7 [2017-07-08T13:06:05] <SISheogorath> @thasmo you mean the long version? https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#long-syntax-1I\'m not completely sure, but IP and port number should be placed under "published". Notice: You can\'t specify an ip if you use it for docker stack deploy
8 [2017-07-08T13:06:06] <gdeverlant> I know chmod that's not a problem
9 [2017-07-08T13:06:25] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: then check what executable you use in the entrypoint script (in you shebang line)
10 [2017-07-08T13:06:34] <SISheogorath> and make sure this is executable
11 [2017-07-08T13:06:36] <SISheogorath> and exists
12 [2017-07-08T13:06:53] <SISheogorath> still nothing really new
13 [2017-07-08T13:07:00] <SISheogorath> basics of shell programming :/
14 [2017-07-08T13:10:27] <SISheogorath> basz: What is the thing you can't connect with 17.06.0-ce?
15 [2017-07-08T13:18:20] <SISheogorath> what base image do you use?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-08T13:18:22] <gdeverlant> this is supposed to run inside of an Alpine image
2 [2017-07-08T13:18:54] <gdeverlant> arm64-alpine
3 [2017-07-08T13:19:27] <SISheogorath> do you run the image privileged?
4 [2017-07-08T13:19:45] <gdeverlant> check there [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-07-08T13:19:52] <gdeverlant> I have the whole listing the last threads
6 [2017-07-08T13:21:35] <SISheogorath> well, as I already asked, do you run the image/container of the image privileged?
7 [2017-07-08T13:21:52] <SISheogorath> since you try to run dind, that's important
8 [2017-07-08T13:23:12] <gdeverlant> but I don't execute this myself
9 [2017-07-08T13:23:30] <gdeverlant> drone is triggering docker
10 [2017-07-08T13:24:09] <gdeverlant> I found this link [<-ISSUE->]
11 [2017-07-08T13:24:13] <SISheogorath> and drone runs in docker, too?
12 [2017-07-08T13:24:18] <gdeverlant> yes
13 [2017-07-08T13:25:19] <SISheogorath> in this case this is more a drone problem than it is a docker problem. The solution is easy: run it in privileaged mode, since this is a basic requirement of dind
14 [2017-07-08T13:26:07] <gdeverlant> Do I need dind
15 [2017-07-08T13:26:17] <gdeverlant> how Do I know that my version is greater than 1.8
16 [2017-07-08T13:26:31] <SISheogorath> I don't know, you are the one who currently tries to run dind
17 [2017-07-08T13:27:08] <SISheogorath> >.>-> 17.03 is greater than 1.8
18 [2017-07-08T13:27:27] <SISheogorath> and yes, before 17.03 it was 1.13
19 [2017-07-08T13:27:44] <SISheogorath> so yes, it's greater even after the versioning changed
20 [2017-07-08T13:28:04] <gdeverlant> It means that I don't need dind because of [<-ISSUE->]
21 [2017-07-08T13:30:00] <gdeverlant> how can I adapt my docker-arm64 image [<-CODE->]
22 [2017-07-08T13:30:05] <gdeverlant> without dind
23 [2017-07-08T13:31:25] <SISheogorath> What do you want to do?
24 [2017-07-08T13:32:05] <SISheogorath> and the issue you linked is about something completely different
25 [2017-07-08T13:32:13] <gdeverlant> I checked in my drone compose.yml and there is
26 [2017-07-08T13:32:13] <gdeverlant> DRONE_PLUGIN_PRIVILEGED=ergu/drone-docker-arm64,ergu/drone-git-arm64
27 [2017-07-08T13:32:42] <SISheogorath> can you please check that the container is privileged by inspecting it?
28 [2017-07-08T13:33:03] <gdeverlant> I don't control it actually
29 [2017-07-08T13:33:10] <gdeverlant> drone is connected to my gogs
30 [2017-07-08T13:33:18] <gdeverlant> and is triggered when I push
31 [2017-07-08T13:33:50] <SISheogorath> well,  you should still be able to do everything that drone does to reproduce/debug possible issues
32 [2017-07-08T13:34:05] <SISheogorath> check it out on the machine
33 [2017-07-08T13:34:09] <SISheogorath> maybe the container still exists
34 [2017-07-08T13:35:19] <SISheogorath> EHHHH question: have you made sure, that bash is installed?
35 [2017-07-08T13:35:26] <SISheogorath> alpines default shell isash/busybox
36 [2017-07-08T13:37:50] <gdeverlant> is it necessary the script has [<-CODE->]
37 [2017-07-08T13:38:38] <SISheogorath> the set -e only says: stop when ever a non-zero exitcode appears
38 [2017-07-08T13:38:59] <SISheogorath> but that doesn't answer about bash
39 [2017-07-08T13:39:01] <gdeverlant>  [<-CODE->]
40 [2017-07-08T13:39:05] <gdeverlant> there is no bash
41 [2017-07-08T13:39:13] <SISheogorath> try adding it
42 [2017-07-08T13:39:15] <gdeverlant> ok
43 [2017-07-08T13:39:21] <SISheogorath> maybe that's already the solution
44 [2017-07-08T13:41:33] <gdeverlant> I'm rebuilding the images
45 [2017-07-08T13:41:38] <gdeverlant> give me a sec I try
46 [2017-07-08T13:42:00] <gdeverlant> normally it has to be #!/bin/bash
47 [2017-07-08T13:42:11] <gdeverlant> so that I need to install bash isn't it ?
48 [2017-07-08T13:42:37] <gdeverlant> isn't #!/bin/sh recognized by default by alpine ?
49 [2017-07-08T13:43:23] <SISheogorath> the problem isn't your script
50 [2017-07-08T13:43:28] <SISheogorath> it's dind
51 [2017-07-08T13:43:37] <SISheogorath> dind is a shellscript that uses bash
52 [2017-07-08T13:43:58] <SISheogorath> could end up in  a weird issue
53 [2017-07-08T13:44:14] <SISheogorath> the#!/bin/shis fine
54 [2017-07-08T13:46:31] <gdeverlant> it makes sense ! men you are really insightful
55 [2017-07-08T13:46:37] <gdeverlant> that's pretty impressive
56 [2017-07-08T13:51:52] <gdeverlant> still get : ERROR: Error response from daemon: oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused "exec: \\"/usr/local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh\\": permission denied"
57 [2017-07-08T14:07:08] <gdeverlant> the drone-git plugin and drone-docker plugin I have adapted to arm64 actually are built from Alpine within
58 [2017-07-08T14:07:20] <gdeverlant> the drone-git seems to work well
59 [2017-07-08T14:07:33] <gdeverlant> the clone is achieved successfully by drone
60 [2017-07-08T14:07:39] <gdeverlant> only the docker part is not passing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-08T13:58:35] <SISheogorath> anything from SELinux or AppArmor? Maybe you run into limits there? and as already mentioned, you should verify that the container is actually running in privileged mode
2 [2017-07-08T14:03:23] <SISheogorath> Also verify that the binaries in your image work and are not for another architecture /o\\ that would be the worst case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-08T14:15:34] <SISheogorath> Do you know how to work withstrace?
2 [2017-07-08T14:16:29] <gdeverlant> no
3 [2017-07-08T14:16:48] <gdeverlant> drone server and drone client are running on my arm64 board
4 [2017-07-08T14:17:20] <gdeverlant> and the agent triggers the ergu/drone-docker-arm64
5 [2017-07-08T14:18:14] <gdeverlant> what is strace
6 [2017-07-08T14:18:34] <SISheogorath> a debugging tool to trace syscalls
7 [2017-07-08T14:18:42] <SISheogorath> which would you directly lead to the problem
8 [2017-07-08T14:18:54] <SISheogorath> but it's alittle bitverbose
9 [2017-07-08T14:18:55] <gdeverlant> how can I debug on my arm64 board  what is going on
10 [2017-07-08T14:19:06] <gdeverlant> with drone agent ?
11 [2017-07-08T14:20:01] <SISheogorath> that's a problem of your setup .-. I can't solve everything for you, you should try to get any way into such a machine by SSH
12 [2017-07-08T14:20:06] <SISheogorath> when you can debug
13 [2017-07-08T15:20:14] <gdeverlant> SISheogorath: Thanx you did so much like everytime
14 [2017-07-08T15:20:29] <gdeverlant> I will do my due diligence on my side
15 [2017-07-08T15:52:45] <gdeverlant> It doesn't seem to be related with my problem@basz

1 [2017-07-08T14:22:40] <kbespalov> Hi foks! Does anyone know companies who provides kubernetes as the service?Somethning like heroku, but with ability to use k8s DSL to define containers infrastracture.
2 [2017-07-08T14:25:14] <SISheogorath> kbespalov: techtonic, Google itself and iirc Amazon, too
3 [2017-07-08T14:25:34] <SISheogorath> that's the one I know out of my head, there are maybe even more
4 [2017-07-08T14:27:29] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: I'm sorry but it will go way to time consuming to completely debug this in a peer session. Search for a good tutorial how to find the reasons for permission denied withstrace. There should be some out in the world.
5 [2017-07-09T09:38:33] <SISheogorath> Yves: did you set--dns-searchwhen you start your image? Not sure if it will really alter it, but it should. In general the question, why you need to do so
6 [2017-07-09T09:40:48] <SISheogorath> WillSkates: can you provide the error message?
7 [2017-07-09T09:41:17] <SISheogorath> Also check that the network is not isolated by usingdocker inspect
8 [2017-07-09T09:43:11] <SISheogorath> Yves: I just thought a bit about your problem: docker has to setndots:0because this is the only way how docker internal networking works
9 [2017-07-09T11:41:06] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: You can usedocker saveto export it as tar file and then export the data using your favorite tar client. But I'm not sure what is easier to do
10 [2017-07-09T12:37:43] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: Checked [<-LINK->] ?
11 [2017-07-09T20:30:13] <SISheogorath> Yves: I would suggest you to file a bug on github so you get an explanation why it is needed or someone will fix it. If you don't want to fix it this way I would suggest to simply add an sed statement to your entrypoint script that strips it out. Isn't nice, but works
12 [2017-07-09T22:11:23] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: No, as outside of docker, it's called reverse proxy.
13 [2017-07-09T22:12:00] <SISheogorath> Yves: Well, in this case you actually run out of options. Using an entrypoint is the only way right now

16 [2017-07-10T06:54:30] <SISheogorath> coding-yogi: links are deprecated, so the suggestion is to use normal networking.
17 [2017-07-10T07:57:30] <SISheogorath> coding-yogi: since links a deprecated on the engine base andexternal_linksare a docker-compose construct that uses thelinkson container base,external_linksare deprecated, too
18 [2017-07-10T08:36:03] <SISheogorath> Create a network, start your container with it, then add the network in your compose file as external

3 [2017-07-09T11:34:16] <gdeverlant> right now I do this [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-07-09T11:35:22] <gdeverlant> but it might be incorrect I think
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-09T11:41:36] <MaxGoh> Hey@SISheogorathwonder if you know how can I docker-compose my flask application, and have it —watch the folder for any changes?

1 [2017-07-09T17:24:56] <Vynlar> Howdy folks, I'm having some troubles. I'm attempting to use a docker swarm to host some static content using nginx containers. I've created a swarm over two physical servers, one manager and one worker. I can successfully launch a replica 2 nginx service across these two nodes and their appropriate docker containers show up indocker psanddocker service ps nginx. I created this service using--publish 80:80and adocker inspect --pretty nginxconfirms that the port is exposed. I've checked that dockerd is listening on port 80 using netstat; however, when I open my manager's public ip in the browser, I get aConnection refusederror. What steps should I take to figure out what is wrong? Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-09T19:20:39] <matrixbot> Yves@Sheogorath(Gitter) I have set the dns_search, I see it in the container/etc/resolv.confbut I also seeoptions ndots:15 ndots:0. The first is inserted through/etc/docker/daemon.jsonand is what I want. The 2nd is appended by docker (libnetwork) and prevents proper usage. The container DNS at 127.0.0.11 tries figuring out a name on the host network, fails and stops there.Removing thendots:0setting allow proper operation and 127.0.0.11 answers properly on container names and host network names. [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-09T21:20:17] <MaxGoh> Hey guys, how can I host 2 docker container in 1 server?
2 [2017-07-09T21:20:27] <MaxGoh> one would be example.com and another would be api.example.com
3 [2017-07-09T21:21:01] <MaxGoh> is it docker swarm?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-09T21:51:20] <matrixbot> YvesSheogorath (Gitter): Bug already filed.I am not using an entrypoint, I use USER & CMD, that container is intended to run without intervention. Now if I fix resolv in the Dockerfile, it get overwritten at runtime and if I try at runtime, the selected user isn't root so edit fails.
2 [2017-07-10T01:47:52] <matrixbot>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] the gateway isn't set. How does one sets the gateway with docker-compose v3?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T02:29:29] <rcjsuen>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Given the above Dockerfile, why is no error outputted? Is it exposing 80? 8081? 801? I'm having troubles understanding how escape characters are being parsed/handled.
2 [2017-07-10T03:04:45] <rcjsuen> Looks like 8081 is exposed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T03:10:08] <FrankYu> Hi there, Is it possible to rsync images on hub.docker.com to my local repos?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T06:11:35] <coding-yogi> Hi, What should I be using to link external containers from my Docker Compose? Should it be links or external_links?
2 [2017-07-10T06:15:41] <coding-yogi> I am trying to use mongo db external container
3 [2017-07-10T06:16:06] <coding-yogi> which is started with command --> docker run --name some-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo
4 [2017-07-10T06:16:29] <coding-yogi> I am trying to use it with external_link in my docker compose with below config
5 [2017-07-10T06:16:48] <coding-yogi>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-07-10T07:11:39] <coding-yogi> SISheogorath: , links are deprecated not the external_links right?
7 [2017-07-10T08:21:09] <coding-yogi> SISheogorath: , thanks for the info , appreciate it. ..any pointers for using network?
8 [2017-07-10T08:23:23] <coding-yogi> I have a mongodb container and I need to use it in my docker-compose
9 [2017-07-10T10:00:14] <coding-yogi> I created a newtork, I started my mongodb container within that network with --network flag
10 [2017-07-10T10:00:21] <coding-yogi> so far so good
11 [2017-07-10T10:00:42] <coding-yogi> I also added network in compose file with tag networks:
12 [2017-07-10T10:00:46] <coding-yogi> is that correct
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T10:18:04] <gdeverlant> Sheogorath: If I'm running DinD does the host docker need to be the same version as the one in the container ?
2 [2017-07-10T10:19:46] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: good question, I don't really know. From my first understanding I would say no, since the docker instances aren't really talking to each other, but since both maybe modify various kernel parameter it could may cause conflicts if they aren't.
3 [2017-07-10T10:21:04] <gdeverlant> yesterday you suggest me to run the container locally first before I'm able to debug
4 [2017-07-10T10:21:18] <gdeverlant> DinD with strace
5 [2017-07-10T10:22:26] <gdeverlant> This is what I got : [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-07-10T10:22:46] <gdeverlant> When I run with privileged : [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-07-10T10:23:06] <gdeverlant> Does it seem to be running without problem ?
8 [2017-07-10T10:26:25] <gdeverlant> Do you see any problem with this DinD Container ?
9 [2017-07-10T11:15:29] <gdeverlant> how can I install docker-engine on aarch64 system ?
10 [2017-07-10T11:15:38] <gdeverlant> is there no official binaries ?
11 [2017-07-10T11:21:35] <SISheogorath> I think not

14 [2017-07-10T11:25:19] <SISheogorath> The only problem I see in this "big paste" is that you try to build a docker file in a directory that has no
15 [2017-07-10T11:26:30] <SISheogorath> /Dockerfile: no such file or directory<-- Should be fixable. But it's not really a docker problem
16 [2017-07-10T11:28:41] <gdeverlant> normally this is passed by drone
17 [2017-07-10T11:43:59] <gdeverlant> does someone know why I keep getting those huge logs when I do something on the bash ????? [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T11:44:20] <imaia> Hey guys, I made this docker setup for python; I believe it could benefit with some hardening or, maybe, deploy friendly setup. Pull Requests and suggestions are very much welcomed [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T14:05:15] <ahmetyasary_twitter> Hello everyone, I'll use the docker for the first time. How and where should I start? or Would you recommend a book to get started? Thanks.
2 [2017-07-10T14:09:51] <ahmetyasary_twitter> Thanks for the great info you gave me.I'll look.
3 [2017-07-10T14:13:01] <pjetr> I read the docs, and did the examples
4 [2017-07-10T14:13:05] <pjetr> and posted questions here and on reddit
5 [2017-07-10T18:09:35] <ahmetyasary_twitter> OK. I will try. Thanks@pjetr

1 [2017-07-10T18:05:52] <brjadams> anyone use docker on Ubuntu 16.04?
2 [2017-07-10T18:09:29] <brjadams> I cannot get pip to see a local domain when attempting to install packages in my container.
3 [2017-07-10T19:32:56] <brjadams> nothing that I run via docker-compose seems to be able to talk to the network. yum updates, etc, anything on the container seems to fail.
4 [2017-07-10T19:33:15] <brjadams> What are some steps I should take? Ubuntu 16.04, it's a centos image
5 [2017-07-10T20:16:07] <brjadams> SISheogorath: ,  during build?
6 [2017-07-10T20:17:07] <SISheogorath> yes, builds run in inside a container and  use the default network
7 [2017-07-10T20:17:16] <SISheogorath> if you don't specify another network
8 [2017-07-10T20:17:37] <brjadams> how do I check the dns udring build I guess is what I'm asking
9 [2017-07-10T20:18:50] <SISheogorath> runcat /etc/resolve.confduring build process should work
10 [2017-07-10T20:19:04] <brjadams> so, in the Dockerfile have it do that?
11 [2017-07-10T20:20:49] <brjadams> in my personal resolve.conf i have: [<-CODE->]
12 [2017-07-10T20:24:39] <SISheogorath> yes, in the Dockerfilemaybe simply define an short one: [<-CODE->]
13 [2017-07-10T20:27:41] <brjadams>  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-07-10T20:29:54] <brjadams> while perusing SO for a solution, one suggested: [<-CODE->] in the docker.service file.
15 [2017-07-10T20:30:13] <brjadams> So I think that's  where the 253 range is coming from
16 [2017-07-10T21:03:59] <brjadams> 10.252.252.252 was there
17 [2017-07-10T21:04:02] <brjadams> i copied 253 into it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T20:00:22] <SISheogorath> mahenrique94: The same way, you would connect your mongodb from another computer
2 [2017-07-10T20:00:39] <SISheogorath> ahmetyasary_twitter: Check [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-07-10T20:01:34] <SISheogorath> brjadams: check the dns server during build. possible they are set to8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
4 [2017-07-10T20:06:05] <SISheogorath> if you use direct IPs, check that they don't collide with the docker IP scopes on your local machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-10T20:47:48] <SISheogorath> what? so your  local DNS servers are10.252.252.252and10.253.253.253or did you blindly copy?
2 [2017-07-10T21:22:33] <SISheogorath> >.>you know that you have to use real DNS servers?

1 [2017-07-11T10:53:52] <matrixbot> YvesA firewall maybe? I was having the same problem until I told UFW to allow from and to 172.16.0.0/12

1 [2017-07-11T12:48:27] <Richard87> Hi guys! I'm completley new to docker, but was hoping some of you could guide me to a comprehensive tutorial ( /book maybe?) My goal is to run my symfony application in docker, but have a specific docker container to build and test the application, thencopythe build into a readonly container, and when that is online, switch the old version over to the new version...
2 [2017-07-11T12:49:51] <Richard87> What I'm doing now is copying the new application to a folder on my server, installing it, andmigratingthe database schema (without it, the tests won't run), then when the tests complete, activate the new folder... The problem is if the tests fails, then the database might already be migrated if there was any changes, and the old version would also fail since the database is out of sync :/
3 [2017-07-11T12:51:08] <Richard87> I have managed to get the first part up and running with BitBucket pipeline (launching a new container, installing everything,copyingthe old db and testing the migrations, and then running tests)
4 [2017-07-11T12:51:50] <Richard87> But I don't know how to do the next 2 steps properly, create a new production instance, build it, migrate db, and then activate it :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T13:29:09] <oleic> hey, I run docker in docker. the first docker instance is linked with an another container. is it possible for the containers running in the second docker instance to communicate with the linked container from the first docker instance?
2 [2017-07-11T13:38:10] <oleic> pjetr: i am currently working on my bachelorthesis. I have write a cloud service, that  manages docker containers. portability is the only thing that i will gain from this i think. its just a prototype, so i havent put so much thought in it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T13:32:28] <pjetr> Richard87: that sounds like a cool project. I don't use docker that intensive yet. Only for development, so nothing crucial. I started out with the docker docs, which went quite some ways. And the second resource I used was [<-LINK->] and, you know [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-07-11T13:32:43] <pjetr> and last, this channel
3 [2017-07-11T13:33:23] <pjetr> I think I've gotten quite a robust well dockerized development environment out of it.
4 [2017-07-11T13:33:53] <pjetr> oleic: [real question] why would you do that?
5 [2017-07-11T13:36:48] <pjetr> oleic: I mean, why would you run docker in docker? What is to be gained from it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T13:40:00] <SISheogorath> @Richard87 running symphony in docker is easy -> check the official php container, install all additional dependencies in there, put your app in there and add a entrypoint script to generate the configs by env vars and/or docker secrets or simply use the newly introduced config management.Anyways:I don't see the need to create two separated images for testing and production. You should be able to run unit tests outside of docker and the integration and smoke tests should run against the image you want to use in production to get reliable results. So if you want, you can actually build your container with unittests as build step in multi-staged builds, but be aware that you need docker 17.06 for this to work.The switch problem is something you always run into. The typical way to solve it: Run the upgrade database on startup. and if you may want to fall back, you need to write migration steps in both ways or test your application completely. If you want it completely 0-downtime it becomes really difficult and you may need an additional layer, with allows to write to multiple backend versions. also not nice, but works. But if you are not at the scale of google or facebook, I would trow this idea away
2 [2017-07-11T13:41:41] <SISheogorath> oleic: when you say linked you mean--link?
3 [2017-07-11T13:42:29] <SISheogorath> pjetr: Hint: There is also the docker community ecosystem. [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-07-11T13:42:32] <Richard87> SISheogorath: ,@pjetrThanks guys! Yeah, I think maybe testing and building could be the same container but I have to switch database link, I have to see how that works...
5 [2017-07-11T13:42:37] <oleic> SISheogorath: yeah that's what i mean
6 [2017-07-11T13:42:59] <SISheogorath> oleic: you shouldn't do this. It's deprecated for multiple reasons
7 [2017-07-11T13:43:07] <SISheogorath> use networking instead
8 [2017-07-11T13:43:48] <oleic> SISheogorath: i used the link from docker-compose. isnt it the same?
9 [2017-07-11T13:44:06] <SISheogorath> Richard87: check [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-07-11T13:44:21] <SISheogorath> oleic: it is, and it is also deprecated in compose
11 [2017-07-11T13:44:52] <oleic> SISheogorath: ah okay, good to know. but it will not solve my problem :)
12 [2017-07-11T13:45:31] <SISheogorath> pjetr: yes... that works for a 20MB wordpress database :D but when you think about production databases with terrabytes of data... (or already more than 10 GB are enough to kill a container) it doesn't scale :D
13 [2017-07-11T13:45:55] <Richard87> pjetr: I'm not sure, anyhow I have to copy the running db to test migrations and unit tests/integration tests, but if I just replace prod with the test container, I might loose data if the process takes 5minutes to complete...
14 [2017-07-11T13:48:29] <Richard87> I wonder if I can speed the process up alot if I can take a snapshot of the mysql database, and load it in a new instance for testing, then if it works just replace prod with test, then it would finish in 60seconds which would be acceptable :))
15 [2017-07-11T13:49:20] <Richard87> that sounds nice ;)  It's not ahugedeal, but I'm working on a learning management system, with students in at all times working on stuff :(
16 [2017-07-11T13:49:59] <oleic> my situation looks like this: [<-LINK->]
17 [2017-07-11T13:50:08] <Richard87> what's Dind?
18 [2017-07-11T13:50:29] <oleic> i want c3 communicating to c1
19 [2017-07-11T13:50:34] <Richard87> huh? interresting :)
20 [2017-07-11T13:50:41] <SISheogorath> oleic: links have weird effects, you can try to reach out for the ip of the container linked to the dind container to communicate or try to reach out to it's name. if one thing of both works, it's fine, otherwise, no
21 [2017-07-11T13:50:43] <oleic> yeah, docker in docker
22 [2017-07-11T13:51:17] <SISheogorath> Richard87: yes, it's a weird way to setup docker, but it's possible. [<-LINK->] is based on it.
23 [2017-07-11T13:51:51] <oleic> SISheogorath: i didnt want to fiddle directly with ip adresses, because ip adresses can change
24 [2017-07-11T13:52:13] <oleic> i thought, there would be a mechanism or something in docker
25 [2017-07-11T13:52:33] <SISheogorath> I know, in this case it's more about general possiblity of communucation
26 [2017-07-11T13:53:54] <SISheogorath> if it  works by ip, you start hacking the dns discovery
27 [2017-07-11T13:54:19] <SISheogorath> otherwise you don't need to try it
28 [2017-07-11T13:55:13] <SISheogorath> the current docker way would be usage of a network instead of--link
29 [2017-07-11T13:55:25] <SISheogorath> which is by the way something you would do, when you reach out for the IP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T13:44:19] <pjetr> actually the database seems quite easy as well? Simply provide a nightly dump, and spawn a new mysql-container. It doesn't even need to persist any data. Simply install the database, run migrations and run tests. When the tests are completed, simply clean up the container.@Richard87&@SISheogorath
2 [2017-07-11T13:46:28] <pjetr> ah, yes, our application is long from anywhere in that size, hence why there is no need for docker in production yet :D
3 [2017-07-11T13:47:01] <pjetr> we simply have a cron running to create a nightly mysqldump
4 [2017-07-11T13:48:03] <pjetr> since the use of our app is strictly local bussiness hours
5 [2017-07-11T13:48:14] <pjetr> no worries there
6 [2017-07-11T13:49:16] <pjetr> that's how I would do it, connect to a different database container for testing
7 [2017-07-11T13:50:21] <pjetr> I'd say Docker in Docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T14:00:35] <pjetr> SISheogorath: more on links being deprecated :) [<-LINK->] this is how I link my containers on the virtual network. You're saying that I shouldn't do this? [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-07-11T14:01:00] <pjetr> wowzers, that turned out bigger than I anticipated :D
3 [2017-07-11T14:01:49] <SISheogorath> you already have them on networks, what do you need thelinksfor?
4 [2017-07-11T14:03:10] <pjetr> I thought it was the links that created the dns records or hosts or whatever :)
5 [2017-07-11T14:04:03] <pjetr> so without links I should still be able to link tophpfrom myweb?
6 [2017-07-11T14:04:49] <SISheogorath> yes
7 [2017-07-11T14:05:03] <pjetr> good to know :D
8 [2017-07-11T14:05:26] <SISheogorath> links do weird things, they map networks ports and share environment variables (think about possible secrets) and other things you may don't want to do
9 [2017-07-11T14:06:40] <SISheogorath> See [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-11T14:07:46] <oleic> with --network="host" i was able to let C3 to communicate with C1 via http
2 [2017-07-11T14:08:07] <SISheogorath> yes, that's true, but that also breaks the whole network isolation
3 [2017-07-11T14:08:20] <SISheogorath> you should keep that in mind@oleic
4 [2017-07-11T14:08:35] <oleic> yeah i know... but i think thats okay for my project
5 [2017-07-11T14:08:54] <oleic> but now i dont know, how to let C1 communicate with C3
6 [2017-07-11T14:09:20] <SISheogorath> if you run both with--network=hostit works identical
7 [2017-07-11T14:09:37] <SISheogorath> since both operate on the hosts network stack

1 [2017-07-11T21:27:22] <ketchupmonkey> Hi Everyone! I have a question. Has anyone used oracle database on docker? I am just wondering about the licensing. Is it allowed to be used in a corporate environment or only for personal use?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-12T07:25:57] <jeserkin> Hello guys. I have read, that it is best practice to have a separate container for database if few containers are using database of same type, but I am having trouble of finding any good example on how to implement it. It seems there are few options. One of them islink. Any good articles on how to combine? I did read version 3 of docker documentation, but real world example woulbe much appreciated. I would like to define as much as possible indocker-compose
2 [2017-07-12T16:38:31] <jeserkin> carlosjgp: will check out WordPress example for sure.
3 [2017-07-12T16:39:30] <jeserkin> pjetr: what should be used instead of links? What is the other way to expose containers to each other?
4 [2017-07-12T17:43:38] <jeserkin> You mean directly use IP provided to required container?

3 [2017-07-13T07:40:47] <gdeverlant> I wanted to know if it is possible inside of a Dockerfile to do a for loop for dynamic list of exposed ports ?
4 [2017-07-13T09:02:13] <gdeverlant> To yall I wanted to know if it is possible inside of a Dockerfile to do a for loop in an array for to output a dynamic list of exposed ports give to an ENV variable?

1 [2017-07-13T07:46:48] <dv29> Hello, i have an issue with docker and nodejs, we are using volumes to mount node_modules, we haveprehooklibrary for runninglinterbefore we commit, but the issue is the library is insidenode_modulesand we dont have permission to execute it, any idea how to make it work
2 [2017-07-13T07:49:37] <dv29> the hooks are fired from host os, because that where we commit from
3 [2017-07-13T07:51:20] <dv29> i think it does, as the hooks are fired by git, which is on host os
4 [2017-07-13T07:51:22] <dv29> yes it does
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-13T07:48:41] <airtonix> why don't you have permission?docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/somewhere/in/the/container yourimagename node ./node_modules/.bin/linterdoesn't work?
2 [2017-07-13T07:49:46] <airtonix> yeah?
3 [2017-07-13T07:50:06] <airtonix> I mean why would that stop you? just mount$PWD/.git:/app/.git
4 [2017-07-13T07:50:27] <dv29> Let me give it a try
5 [2017-07-13T07:50:34] <dv29> havent tried that
6 [2017-07-13T07:50:37] <airtonix> wait git has nothing to do with it.
7 [2017-07-13T07:51:08] <airtonix> dv29: does your library provide something in./node_modules/.bin/?
8 [2017-07-13T07:51:47] <airtonix> dv29: can you edit the.git/hooks?
9 [2017-07-13T07:51:57] <dv29> yes
10 [2017-07-13T07:52:03] <dv29> thats on host btw
11 [2017-07-13T07:52:43] <airtonix> dv29: then i'd be looking at modifying them to do rundocker run --rm -it blah blah blah
12 [2017-07-13T07:53:17] <airtonix> dv29: i assume it only needs to look at source code and doesnt require access to the local git repo
13 [2017-07-13T07:54:14] <airtonix> dv29: btw using docker-compose will make your commands cross platform across unix and windows
14 [2017-07-13T07:57:07] <dv29> we are using docker-compose
15 [2017-07-13T07:57:35] <dv29> the hook that we wrote requires access to local git repo

1 [2017-07-13T09:06:30] <SISheogorath> gdeverlant: nope, you can't do any compute magic outside ofRUN. But when you want random ports, why not simply use the-Pparameter of swarm or the-p <port number>for the run statement, which will expose your ports to a random port on your machine

1 [2017-07-13T09:10:23] <gdeverlant> I have a build script which generates server settings based on params entered by user
2 [2017-07-13T09:11:01] <gdeverlant> I need to compile nginx with the ports that the user decided in the script
3 [2017-07-13T09:11:55] <gdeverlant> The best would be to just generate the Dockerfile for nginx based on the entries of the script
4 [2017-07-13T09:12:01] <gdeverlant> and then build the Dockerfile
5 [2017-07-13T09:13:13] <gdeverlant> would be amazing that someone confirms if exposed ports can be given by ENV variable

1 [2017-07-14T18:23:47] <MadMub> Hello. I’m developing a very unique application and it involves starting and stopping hundred of containers. So far on my Mac I’m only able to get 1.8 containers/sec (containerCreate + containerStart) using the golang sdk (which to my knowledge just invokes the http api)
2 [2017-07-14T18:24:34] <MadMub> does anyone know what kind of throughput docker can support? Does that number seem normal (about 1~2 container starts per second). I could not find much documentation on that kind of benchmark online
3 [2017-07-14T18:25:35] <MadMub> I’ve given my docker for mac 7 cores and 14gb of memory, and switched to the overlay2 storage driver, is there anything else I could try to get maximum startup performance, I am just running an alpine container that performssleep 600
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-14T18:43:46] <megamindbrian> vodnanmaga_twitter: SeleniumHQ/docker on GitHub has images with working chrome install.
2 [2017-07-14T18:44:46] <megamindbrian> vodnanmaga_twitter: it's painful the traditional way so use their commands from the Base/Dockerfile. Just a simple bash script with wget.

1 [2017-07-14T20:39:21] <lalib> here: hey there, is it possible to tag an image with multiple tags and push it to docker hub?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-14T21:24:34] <SISheogorath> lalib: yes, it's possible. If you want to use automated builds it becomes a bit more difficult: [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-07-15T11:47:15] <SISheogorath> vodnanmaga_twitter: this will become super hard, because doxker on mac runs inside a virtual machine and you have to bring the xsession outside which the again needs some kind of remote connection. So it doesn't really makes sense. For chrome in headless mode, I'm not aure about the details, but there was a problem with missing kernel capabilities last time I talked about/tried it.
3 [2017-07-15T11:52:07] <SISheogorath> MadMub: not running on macos possibly improves the number since you are outside of virtualization then. Also you can try to use ContainerLinux or CoreOS as base OS which may applies low level improvements to docker by optimizing the linux kernel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-15T15:25:55] <gdeverlant> I have a question related with networking: I have a private registry and I'm trying to build another Dockerfile which reference to my private registry like FROM myprivateregistry:5000/danny/nginx:1.11. When drone tries to run the drone-docker-arm64 plugin in the background inside of its container I get this log : Get [<-LINK->] : dial tcp: lookup myprivateregistry on 127.0.0.11:53: no such hostWhat do I need to do so that my private repo which is a node in my cluster be recognized by its hostname?I don't want to endup with static ip addresses in my Dockerfile like : FROM 192.168.1.3:5000/danny/nginx:1.11
2 [2017-07-15T15:27:37] <gdeverlant> So basically drone agent which is a docker container running is running another DinD container on one of the nodes of the cluster
3 [2017-07-15T15:31:27] <gdeverlant> The sequence is shown like that
4 [2017-07-15T15:31:29] <gdeverlant>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-07-15T15:41:42] <gdeverlant> all those containers are running on the same node in the cluster
6 [2017-07-15T15:41:59] <gdeverlant> the registry is in another node between the 12 nodes
7 [2017-07-15T17:49:37] <gdeverlant> my router is 192.168.1.1
8 [2017-07-15T17:49:45] <gdeverlant> the registry is on 192.168.1.2
9 [2017-07-15T17:50:04] <gdeverlant> and the CI server is on 192.168.1.13
10 [2017-07-15T17:50:19] <gdeverlant> they all have server1 to serverX as names
11 [2017-07-15T17:50:56] <gdeverlant> Like this diagram

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-15T20:00:23] <SISheogorath> gdverlant: Well, what you need then is to use an public DNS Server and reference the IP of your host service the registry. If you run it in swarm, then any swarm member. Or if you don't want to go for an public DNS server you have to provide a default DNS Server to your DinD instance which knows the needed DNS names.
2 [2017-07-15T20:00:51] <SISheogorath> kerbymart: Hi
3 [2017-07-16T07:38:43] <SISheogorath> ninogomez: not really, and it doesn't make a lot of sense because in dockerlocalhostis broken. So it's better to fix the software
4 [2017-07-16T08:52:34] <SISheogorath> Simply use the--dnsoption of the deamon
5 [2017-07-16T11:20:48] <SISheogorath> Simply usels ./react-appfrom the directory your docker-compose.yml is in.
6 [2017-07-16T11:22:58] <SISheogorath> If you want to have the "in container" view, usedocker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q <servicename>) /bin/bashthen run ls for the path you specified

Thanks a lot!

1 [2017-07-16T12:21:29] <MaxGoh> Hi guys. I currently have two repository for frontend and backend using Docker, along with a database. How can I deploy them to a server (preferably AWS) and map my frontend to example.com and my backend to api.example.com all on the same server. This is because it's a small application and there's no point getting 3 servers to host each layer separately.

1 [2017-07-17T14:59:15] <creyke> Yes. Basically, if you\'re a .NET dev and want a job in 5 years time that isn\'t "keeping the lights on" it\'s time to learn Linux and bash :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-07-17T19:14:16] <laytoneverson> Is it okay to combine services build from different parents? i.e. If I use the official Nginx service with a web service build from ubuntu? I'm just trying to maintain package versions equal to the versions installed on this vagrant box...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-17T21:56:51] <SISheogorath> laytoneverson: what are you trying to build? In a image you can only have oneFROM. But since we have multi-staged builds, you can have oneFROMper build stage and then copy all needed files. But you have to make sure that your libraries are in place, if you use dynamic linked ones
2 [2017-07-17T22:43:09] <SISheogorath> the point is that docker-compose names everything using a project prefix.
3 [2017-07-17T22:43:26] <SISheogorath> if you don't specify one, it's the directory name, where you started docker-compose
4 [2017-07-17T22:43:58] <SISheogorath> if you are not sure, usedocker network ls
5 [2017-07-19T21:20:37] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: are you sure your machine is allowed to access registry-1.docker.com? To test, maybe trywget
6 [2017-07-20T15:27:13] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: I would suggest you to read this guide: [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-07-20T15:28:06] <SISheogorath> vodnanmaga_twitter: can you provide a bit more context? What image did you used, where did you get the error message, ...

1 [2017-07-18T07:25:17] <FrankYu> Hi,  If I have install some package on host, should I install it in docker, or just use those on host?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-18T12:21:16] <MaxGoh> Hi guys, I’m trying to deploy my app to AWS ECS
2 [2017-07-18T12:21:29] <MaxGoh> I’m just wondering, can I push all docker image to one instance?
3 [2017-07-18T12:21:39] <MaxGoh> Instead of running 3 instance for a simple web app
4 [2017-07-18T12:21:50] <MaxGoh> DB / Backend / Frontend
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-18T12:27:38] <stephencornelius> @MaxGoh yes you can run all on 1 instance. you can use the ecs-cli compose (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cmd-ecs-cli-compose.html)put all your containers in a single compose file as described above and use the cli to bring them up on your ECS instance. It will add all containers to the same instance
2 [2017-07-18T12:28:32] <stephencornelius> For the DB though you should either use RDS or a mounted volume otherwise you will lose your data if the instance goes down
3 [2017-07-18T13:49:32] <stephencornelius> In that case the way you could do it is keep it as two separate compose files and run as two separate apps and link them through dns. If youre using ECS would recommend using an Application Load Balancer that can direct traffic based on host header. If you only run 1 instance in for ECS then it will still load both apps onto the same instance as thats all thats available
4 [2017-07-18T14:05:30] <stephencornelius> No you would be running 1 instance but with 2 containers on it so would be the cost of the 1 instance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-18T13:42:19] <MaxGoh> Hey. Thanks for that! Just an add on question, how should I design my application then? As in like my backend and frontend are in seperate repository. And I normally start them by turning on backend and frontend separately with their own docker-compose.By having just one docker compose file for everything, does that mean that I have to merge everything into one repository? Thanks for the help too!
2 [2017-07-18T13:43:00] <MaxGoh> Because I want to use travis ci to automate all my pushes further on as well.
3 [2017-07-18T14:03:35] <MaxGoh> stephencornelius: , I see. but with regards to the cost, would it be the same, or would it be twice as much?
4 [2017-07-18T14:03:42] <MaxGoh> Because I would be running 2 instance instead of 1
5 [2017-07-18T14:13:07] <MaxGoh> Oh, so I will set up everything in the cluster
6 [2017-07-18T14:13:14] <MaxGoh> And set up just one instance for it yeah.
7 [2017-07-18T14:13:15] <MaxGoh> Cool.

1 [2017-07-20T13:27:07] <vodnanmaga_twitter> when trying to install google chrome from SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium on my mac machine running docker, I get/bin/sh: apt-key: command not found.  Anybody have any idea on how to resolve this?
2 [2017-07-20T15:41:02] <vodnanmaga_twitter> SISheogorath: I resolved it. It appears that the base image i was using was centOS 7. cent apparently usesyumnotapt-get. So i had to install chrome usingyum.
3 [2017-07-20T15:44:18] <SISheogorath> @vodnanmaga_twitter
4 [2017-07-20T15:47:34] <SISheogorath> MaxGoh: Go the regular way: First of all check for other flask applications and how they do it. Docker hub is a good place to start. Check for minimal images, but use a base image you know. If you are not good with alpine, search for something debian based instead. Then check their repositories, the less additional files you need, the better it is. Last but not least, start building something. Play around to get a working version. Once it works, share it and you will get suggestions
5 [2017-07-20T22:02:29] <SISheogorath> fny: if you don't do very low level related this, there are usually no problems
6 [2017-07-21T07:22:33] <SISheogorath> alaverty: how would you do it without docker?
7 [2017-07-21T22:40:07] <SISheogorath> If you don't add a port it would try to use HTTPS default port -> 443
8 [2017-07-22T04:59:38] <SISheogorath> alaverty: that wasn't really the question, the point is that you can do nearly everything within Doxker as you do it outside. The notation maybe differs. So if you know what file system you would use with what parameter, you can create suxh a volume, that writes data encrypted
9 [2017-07-22T05:01:47] <SISheogorath> But keep in mind if you don't set it up in a way, where you always recreate the volume on startup of the right container, you can simply attach another container to this volune and read it.
10 [2017-07-23T05:34:28] <SISheogorath> sabrehagen: the technical "details" ofEXPOSEare here: [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-07-23T05:35:27] <SISheogorath> So, yes,EXPOSEis mainly used to inform users. But if you want to use-Pit can be useful.
12 [2017-07-23T05:37:11] <SISheogorath> For example when you have an external reverse proxy that interacts with the docker API you can use -P to create your container and expose the ports to a random port which is then again recognized by the external load balancer and allows redirecting traffic to the right places
13 [2017-07-24T15:48:54] <SISheogorath> Yves: if you don't usedocker stackthere is no real reason to use version 3.
14 [2017-07-24T15:52:51] <SISheogorath> And you can maybe limit it using ulimits. But you should maybe file a bug report about it
15 [2017-07-24T15:55:51] <SISheogorath> SunChero: as@tudvari-nngpointed out, build it with--no-cacheas parameter. And be if there is an error message during build, ir would be useful to provide it along with the Dockerfile you have the problem with.
16 [2017-07-25T07:29:40] <SISheogorath> elclanrs:  [<-LINK->]
17 [2017-07-25T07:31:54] <SISheogorath> imaia: I would suggest you to use a reverse proxy with these feature built-in, like Traefik
18 [2017-07-25T07:32:26] <SISheogorath> But if you really want to use this image, you should maybe file a bug and see how maintained it is?
19 [2017-07-25T07:32:58] <SISheogorath> Oh just saw you already did
20 [2017-07-25T13:05:59] <SISheogorath> donnib: Well, that's a question you can ask more general: What happens to the data that is placed below a mount point?
21 [2017-07-25T13:06:56] <SISheogorath> But to answer your question specific: You can't simply mount a volume on restart. You can only recreate the container which vanishes the old one so the data is gone, too.
22 [2017-07-25T13:29:31] <SISheogorath> why-a?
23 [2017-07-25T13:30:00] <SISheogorath> docker cp <containerid>:/data ./datashould be enough
24 [2017-07-25T13:30:58] <donnib> thank you, i misread the doc where it was stated that cp = cp -a

1 [2017-07-20T14:48:02] <MaxGoh> Hi guys! Anyone familiar with serving flask w/ nginx & uwsgi in Docker?
2 [2017-07-20T15:40:10] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: Sorry, I have been googling all over,  and I’m still stuck on the issue. I’m not even sure where to begin with, if I should have a single Dockerfile or use docker-compose. I’m trying to use this for production.
3 [2017-07-20T15:40:25] <MaxGoh> So I’m checking if there’s anyone who is experienced in this area who could give me some guidance.
4 [2017-07-21T02:07:25] <MaxGoh> SISheogorath: Thanks for that, I have finally managed to got uwsgi working with my Flask this morning before I crashed.
5 [2017-07-21T02:07:42] <MaxGoh> I’ll try to point out the exact gist of the problem next time :)

3 [2017-07-26T07:43:05] <tudvari-nng> cavapoo2_twitter: : you’re right, it isn’t exists a docker toolbox for linux, you can use docker itself from the ubuntu apt repository.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-28T08:32:35] <SISheogorath> basz: no, docker isn't using port 22. That's a host thing where may or may not an SSHd is running
2 [2017-07-28T08:33:54] <basz> SISheogorath: thanks, i took the gamble. All I needed to do is change port in .docker/machine/machines/node-*/config on my local box and all was fine
3 [2017-07-28T08:38:09] <SISheogorath> luchillo17: doxker uses a so called build-context which is usually your repository you use to build your image. The build context directory is specified by as the unnamed parameter of thedocker buildcommand. So for exampledocker build reposets the build context to therepodirectory. Notice: Since docker build the entire thing in using the docker daemon it sends the entire directory to the daemon to build your container. That's why you can only use paths relative to the context abd why you shouldn't and can't add files from outside
4 [2017-07-28T08:39:01] <SISheogorath> crazygit: yes. That's normal.
5 [2017-07-28T11:45:50] <SISheogorath> I would simply use an entrypoint script
6 [2017-07-28T11:46:12] <SISheogorath> Means write it to an.shfile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-28T10:37:32] <luchillo17> I see, so i have opted for making a copy of such files in a folder inside the repo, then tell the dockerfile where to paste when installing, is that better?
2 [2017-07-28T13:15:28] <luchillo17> I'm having a different issue, i'm trying to source the.bash_profilei copy to the/root/folder but both the docker commandRUN source /root/.bash_profileand the source command in ainstall.shscript returnssource: not found.
3 [2017-07-28T13:17:23] <luchillo17> Oh ok, if i put this#!/bin/bashon top of theinstall.shit sources now, however the source of such file fails telling me that an alias is not found, which is actually defined 3 lines up in the same.bash_profile.
4 [2017-07-28T13:19:52] <luchillo17> Same file works in my Mac and another Ubuntu i have in home, why wouldn't in the container? isubuntu-serverthat different?

1 [2017-07-29T01:30:50] <rbalicki2> hi folks, I am new to using docker and I have a chicken-and-egg problem. Mydocker build -t myproject .command requires access to postgres, because I am generating code based on postgres schemas
2 [2017-07-29T01:31:29] <rbalicki2> however, it looks like if I set that up usingdocker-compose.yml, it needs to be published. For it to be published, it needs to be built
3 [2017-07-29T01:31:37] <rbalicki2> What am I missing here?
4 [2017-07-29T01:34:59] <rbalicki2> I think I can't do the latter, because the schema is managed via migrations and is subject to change
5 [2017-07-29T01:35:57] <rbalicki2> could you clarify the first sentence?@karanhiremath
6 [2017-07-29T01:37:15] <rbalicki2> thank you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-29T01:33:14] <karanhiremath> rbalicki2: build yourself an image doing everything up until you need to generate the code for all your dependencies up to that point. then set up your docker-compose with postgres and build a new dockerfile which builds from the first image you created that now handles all the code generation
2 [2017-07-29T01:33:44] <karanhiremath> you can also make a dockerfile to setup the schema in postgres for you
3 [2017-07-29T01:34:08] <karanhiremath> unless you are handling that in your application dockerfile at some point
4 [2017-07-29T01:34:30] <rbalicki2> ah

5 [2017-07-29T07:25:50] <cavapoo2_twitter> yes i followed those
6 [2017-07-29T07:26:04] <karanhiremath> what OS are you using?
7 [2017-07-29T07:26:16] <cavapoo2_twitter> ubuntu 1604 64bit
8 [2017-07-29T07:26:18] <karanhiremath> and which installation method did you choose?

10 [2017-07-29T07:28:08] <karanhiremath> hmmm ok never tried to install on ubuntu so not sure if there are any pitfalls to avoid but its definitely possible we have devs on our team using it on ubuntu
11 [2017-07-29T07:28:46] <cavapoo2_twitter> going try again.
12 [2017-07-29T07:29:06] <cavapoo2_twitter> total breeze on windows :)
13 [2017-07-29T07:29:19] <cavapoo2_twitter> with the toolbox
14 [2017-07-29T07:29:31] <karanhiremath> could be documetation problem, maybe try a different guide [<-LINK->]
15 [2017-07-29T07:30:13] <karanhiremath> looks like that might be the case actually in the brief run through of the docker-ce guide i ran through
16 [2017-07-29T07:30:43] <karanhiremath> looks like the docker-compose instructions for ubuntu just redirect to docker-ce but those don’t specify how to actually install docker-compose on ubuntu
17 [2017-07-29T07:30:52] <cavapoo2_twitter> ok 'ill try this other guide
18 [2017-07-29T07:47:48] <cavapoo2_twitter> thanks at least nowdocker-compose -vcome sback with something
19 [2017-07-29T07:57:25] <cavapoo2_twitter> sudo wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.15.0/docker-compose-uname -s-uname -m> /usr/local/bin/docker-composethis never worked from these instructions [<-LINK->]
20 [2017-07-29T09:35:18] <karanhiremath> when you rununame -swhat’s your output
21 [2017-07-29T09:35:24] <karanhiremath> could be related to that
22 [2017-07-29T10:09:16] <cavapoo2_twitter> comes back with Linux
23 [2017-07-29T10:09:53] <karanhiremath> and what aboutuname -m?
24 [2017-07-29T10:10:45] <cavapoo2_twitter> x_86_64
25 [2017-07-29T10:10:52] <karanhiremath> ahhh theres the issue
26 [2017-07-29T10:11:09] <karanhiremath> was there actualy an underscore between x and 8 when you ran it?
27 [2017-07-29T10:11:25] <karanhiremath> the github release is named x86_64
28 [2017-07-29T10:11:30] <karanhiremath> so its possible thats the issue
29 [2017-07-29T10:11:32] <cavapoo2_twitter> sory i meanx86_64
30 [2017-07-29T10:11:35] <karanhiremath> hmmm
31 [2017-07-29T10:12:21] <cavapoo2_twitter> also curl would not let me install, permission issue. wget was ok though
32 [2017-07-29T10:13:06] <cavapoo2_twitter> mybe issue with 1.15.0
33 [2017-07-29T10:13:33] <cavapoo2_twitter> is that ok to use with 16.04 ubuntu
34 [2017-07-29T10:15:39] <cavapoo2_twitter> its working now, but i'll try again with 1.15.0 since that is newer  / fewer bugs version supposedly ?
35 [2017-07-29T10:23:08] <karanhiremath> hmmmwget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.15.0/docker-compose-\\uname -s`-`uname -m``
36 [2017-07-29T10:23:52] <karanhiremath> damn does markdown now use standard escape chars?

39 [2017-07-29T10:24:38] <karanhiremath> works for me
40 [2017-07-29T10:25:23] <karanhiremath> granted on an ubuntu image lol but maybe the issue is in the permissions? what does this give you?
41 [2017-07-29T10:25:48] <karanhiremath>  [<-CODE->]
42 [2017-07-29T10:26:07] <karanhiremath> it looks likecurltries to download the redirect file
43 [2017-07-29T10:28:20] <karanhiremath> -L flag fixes that though
44 [2017-07-29T10:28:42] <karanhiremath> def looks like a permissions thing - may need to add that step to the documentation
45 [2017-07-29T10:29:17] <karanhiremath> chmod +xshould fix it
46 [2017-07-29T10:29:38] <karanhiremath> oh its in there already
47 [2017-07-29T10:30:32] <karanhiremath> hmmm not sure try again maybe and let me know directly how it goes happy to help suggest a change to the documentation
48 [2017-07-29T10:47:44] <cavapoo2_twitter>  [<-CODE->]
49 [2017-07-29T10:48:15] <cavapoo2_twitter> then achmod + xafter
50 [2017-07-29T10:55:45] <cavapoo2_twitter> is there also a way to clean up what docker did with the network (ifconfig). after stopping the containers and remove images, ifconfig still has some network mappings
51 [2017-07-29T11:11:22] <cavapoo2_twitter> other thansudo ip link delete name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-29T07:24:16] <karanhiremath> cavapoo2_twitter: what are you looking for? just running it without a .yml file for me returns the help instructions, you could try-vif you just want to verify that its installed and get the version or run a simpledocker-compose.ymlfile in—verboseif you aren’t seeing enough output and want to debug further
2 [2017-07-29T07:24:35] <karanhiremath> Jackiegm: interested as well would love to learn more
3 [2017-07-29T07:25:36] <karanhiremath> docker-compose is a seperate install from main docker

1 [2017-07-30T14:55:46] <MaxGoh> Hi guys, I’m currently running Amazon Web Service ECS service. I’m using a docker-compose reverse proxy architecture. So everything is pretty neat right now which have all my services set up on one server. So right now, I’m trying to enable SSL for my web application, I tried using the Application Load Balancer with Amazon Certificate Manager to no avail. Anyone here can guide me on how you got it up?
2 [2017-07-31T03:07:21] <MaxGoh> stephencornelius: Hi, yeah I’m pretty sure I did that, created a ALB with ACM issued certificate, then I created a target group and added my running instance in it. I then added the ALB DNS to my Cloudflare, and right now it’s showing "400 Bad Request The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port”, If it helps, my nginx conf.d files only listens to port 80 with no ssl configured, But I read that using the ALB, everything should be configured on there and not on nginx itself.
3 [2017-07-31T10:40:14] <MaxGoh> Yes, I did set it up on a target group, and yes to the error on nginx as well. Okay, I'll try to twitch around it. One quick question, right now I'm using cloudflare to point to my ec2 instance. So I have 2 sub domains to it. And using ALB, I have to point cloudflare to ALB DNS. It would probably show my frontend fine. But how can I access my backend say api.example.com?
4 [2017-07-31T11:56:25] <MaxGoh> Hm. as in like I'm running a reverse-proxy Docker-compose architecture. Meaning I have a nginx that then calls my internal services (frontend and backend). So, my external nginx listens for different URL. api.example.com and example.com. They are all running on a single instance.
5 [2017-07-31T11:57:05] <MaxGoh> So do I have to create multiple ALB to map to different subdomain?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-30T18:21:43] <johnrizzo1> Hey guys… I’ve been looking for information about what can go into the docker config file and I just can’t find it. This doesn’t seem to have the info I’m looking for [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-07-30T18:22:06] <johnrizzo1> I am trying to figure out how to set a default docker repo.
3 [2017-07-31T00:57:37] <johnrizzo1> Thanks
4 [2017-07-31T00:58:13] <johnrizzo1> I see so we configure the daemon to use the registry not the command line…. :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-30T20:27:24] <stephencornelius> MaxGoh: what isses did you run into? you need to use an application load balancer. create a listener on that for port 443. you then create a target group which you point at your service. You also need to create a rule for you to route requests to your ALB to the correct target group, this is created within the listner on  the ALB. I use host based routing so have a rule for api.example.com pointing to api target group. Something to note about the target group is it has a health check associated with it. if that check is failing it will kill your service so need to ensure that passes, the status is displayed within the target group info. Also if using host based routing you will need to setup dns for the host url cnamed to your ALB url. Theres also the alternative of path based routing on the ALB
2 [2017-07-31T10:37:13] <stephencornelius> MaxGoh: did you set your target group up as http protocol and on port 80? looks like that error is being returned from the nginx container. sounds like youre sending it a https request whereas its only serving on port 80. you could test your alb with a listener on port 80 to make sure that works
3 [2017-07-31T11:51:41] <stephencornelius> MaxGoh: im not sure i understand. your backend is running on ECS as well? every app that runs on ECS give it a separate sub domain and cname to the ALB DNS
4 [2017-07-31T12:27:32] <stephencornelius> ok. no you just need to create separate rules. so you would have 2 sub domains. on your alb you create 2 rules. 1 for api.example.com and 1 for example.com both of which could go to the same target group which presumably is nginx and then that handles routing to the correct service based on the url
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-30T20:40:22] <SISheogorath> johnrizzo1: docker configisNOTfor the configuration of the docker daemon. It's for config objects in swarmmode. Don't mix this up. I know that RedHat uses multiple default registries but I'm not sure if they used did that by changing the source code. May you can find something useful here: [<-LINK->] by changing the default mirror registry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-07-31T15:22:54] <ehernandez-xk> Hello all!I have read about Docker installation, Since the Docker daemon runs only with sudo, I understand that users can mount filesystem directories and do things like sudo, is there a way to prevent this? for example I would like to restrict the user only to mount directories in his $HOME scope.Thanks for the help

1 [2017-07-31T17:44:57] <DWSR> Hey everyone, I'm curious how others solve this: I am running a Swarm in AWS defined by Terraform. The worker nodes are in an ASG so that we can automatically scale out. When a scale-out occurs, the works are successfully added to the swarm via User Data. When a scale-in operation occurs, the node is drained, but also left in a state where the swarm lists it. Is there a way to clean this up, as I can easily see a scenario where, after a few dozen scale-out and scale-ins, the list of nodes is ~90% nodes that no longer exist.
2 [2017-08-01T17:18:50] <imaia> jwilson8767: the fellows are replying in the issues tab; maybe something good will come out of it
3 [2017-08-01T17:28:23] <DWSR> SISheogorath: docker swarm leavedoes not clean up the nodes either. You mustdocker node rmthem manually. I'm wondering how this is done in a large swarm deployment where nodes may be added or removed based on demand.
4 [2017-08-01T18:04:58] <DWSR> SISheogorath: Yeah, I was hoping that that cleanup would be built into Docker, but not to worry if it's not.
5 [2017-08-01T18:05:20] <DWSR> SISheogorath: Another interesting question: Is it possible to automate the registration of a Swarm into Docker Cloud (using BYOS)?
6 [2017-08-01T18:06:27] <SISheogorath> Tbh I have no idea. I'm not a Docker Cloud user.
7 [2017-08-01T18:30:25] <DWSR> Ok, no worries. I think manual registration will probably be OK for now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-01T00:28:20] <SISheogorath> Nope, Eddy, that's not possible. Sonce the docker daemon has to run as root to work. Maybe you can write or find an auth-plugin that provides such a customizablity but my guess is you want to use docker for desktop apps which is something docker isn't made for. I would suggest you to look for appimage, flat packages or snap apps. They are made for desktop applications and non-admin work
2 [2017-08-01T09:31:26] <SISheogorath> Speechkey_twitter: what happens when you use syslog logging in any other software and the syslogd is not available?
3 [2017-08-01T09:35:08] <SISheogorath> DWSR: checkdocker node lsanddocker node rmon your manager nodes. The swarm can't know if the node is down or dead. You have to remove them. Or (and I'm not completely sure about this right now)doxker swarm leavemaybe works, too
4 [2017-08-01T13:34:57] <SISheogorath> ehernandez-xk: then maybe consider to use dind or a kvm based virtualisation to provide everybody an own machine. for dind maybe this is interesting for you: [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-08-01T17:28:48] <SISheogorath> DWSR: Thanks for the info. I wasn't sure about that ^^
6 [2017-08-01T17:29:33] <SISheogorath> you simply run write a script that makes sure only the existing nodes exist.
7 [2017-08-01T17:29:50] <SISheogorath> every usual provisioning software should be able to do that
8 [2017-08-01T17:30:03] <SISheogorath> you have an HTTP API, so use it ^^

1 [2017-08-01T13:04:39] <imaia> jwilson8767: I managed to make it work. The problem is that it won't couple with a underlying nginx server; I'll probably have to mess with the template to make it work. Great project, but still needs some tunning (which is perfectly natural)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-05T21:11:43] <Caroga> Currently thinking about moving my sites/applications to a containerized solution, and I find myself having some implementation questions. Stuff like: should I include this in a container or not. Is this the right place to ask those kind of implementation questions?
2 [2017-08-05T21:13:51] <Caroga> One being: Would it be better to host php-fpm in a different container from my application\'s source code and "mount it in"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-05T22:02:32] <yuriy-yarosh> @Carogait be better to host php-fpm in a different container from my application\'s source code and "mount it in"?Yup, in general you should use immutable containers for your target platform and mount volumes with your code, data and logs ... code should be immutable too for obvious reasons.Storing any valuable data inside the env vars is not a good idea, even if it\'s a common practice... small vulnerability and a getenv() syscall will expose everything. Make sure you\'re clearing your env in the entrypoint script.Volume management changed a lot at recent docker releases, and there\'s multi-stage container builds which are preventing any need in docker-in-docker (dind).In general dind for building and CI tends to be very faulty, because stacking multiple CoW filesystems breaks consistency and your data becomes corrupted after a while.I\'d suggest go for lvm based storage driver instead of the stock OverlayFS and for Cisco\'s Contiv instead of Overlay network driver. If Contiv is too hard for you feel free to start with macvlan instead.
2 [2017-08-06T09:16:38] <yuriy-yarosh> rbalicki2: links are deprecated, I'd suggest you get some understanding how things work without the compose... it's just a yaml config parser which executes the respective docker engine commands. It's better just to read the docs and use plain bash instead nowadays.

1 [2017-08-09T09:30:27] <josemaia> hey guys. I want to build a containerized application that has a web app (port 80), an api gateway (port 81), and a bunch of microservices. If I never want people to communicate directly with port 81 to access the API gateway what should I be running on the port 80 web app? should I just have an NGINX container in port 80 redirect requests like [<-LINK->] to [<-LINK->] ?
2 [2017-08-09T09:44:55] <toftware> josemaia: I think you should run your api gateway on port 80
3 [2017-08-09T09:46:32] <josemaia> have the api gw on 80 and the web app on a non-standard port?
4 [2017-08-09T09:47:00] <toftware> No your web app should be hosted behind the api gateway as well
5 [2017-08-09T09:48:57] <josemaia> hmm, that's an interesting idea. I'm gonna place this as a question on StackOverflow to get more feedback, so if you want karma there feel free to post this there :) [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-08-09T09:50:19] <toftware> I would argue that your webapp is a service as well :)
7 [2017-08-09T09:52:05] <toftware> Another solution would be to have your web app on port 80 and then your api on api.example.com
8 [2017-08-09T09:54:13] <josemaia> how would I go about doing that within the context of a docker/docker-compose architecture?

1 [2017-08-09T11:15:28] <ndpratas> Hi guys, HOW do you manage VOLUMES?I have gitlab as a docker stack in order to any of it's container to be able to run in whatever node is available.For it to work, i need to persist data that is accessible from ANY nodewhat is the correct way to do this?I'm thinking about mounting a shared storage in every node (NFS in fstab) and then just use mapping host_folder:container_folderis this a correct way to do it? I can't seam to wonder that there is probably a better way to do this
2 [2017-08-09T11:26:49] <ndpratas> basz: First of all thanks for answering. I'm not concerned about ssh forwarding but still that info might come in handy in the future. What i'm trying to do is to use gitlab as a Prove of Concept to test the waters out. One of the things I would like to test is shared persisted storage between nodes in order to have container agnostic of the node they are running on. I don't know if I'm having this docker paradigm wrong or something, please tell me from your experience if am I being naive indeed. Also, I didn't want to have stuff in alfa supporting production services but I will check it out (thank for pointing me in the right direction).Still do you see a real problem with my simple solution?
3 [2017-08-09T11:27:13] <ndpratas> (the NFS mount on FSTAB in every worker/manager node)
4 [2017-08-09T13:22:20] <ndpratas> basz: Yes, docker container are supposed to be stateless but they do indeed need some data persistence (in some cases at least like running a DB in a container). I've read everything you pointed me out to but as the post's say it's all still in development and there is nothing worth relying. Do you happen to know if I can mount an NFS volume directly into the container using the volume flag (like --volume nsf_server:/data:container_data)?
5 [2017-08-09T13:25:42] <SISheogorath> ndpratas: you can do so (with iirc 17.05+): [<-LINK->]

7 [2017-08-09T13:26:36] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: Thank you. Let me check that really quick
8 [2017-08-09T13:28:38] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: This was actually what I was asking for. Worth knowing! Thank you. Related, have you read why I\'m asking all of this? Can you please read my last posts (beginning at post "Hi guys, HOW do you manage VOLUMES?") and give me your opinion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-09T11:19:10] <basz> ndpratas: glusterfs, infinity.sh would probably be more dockerish (aquired by docker) but still alpha. or just bound gitlab to same host. which is what I did, cause my swarm exposes several ssh services (such as git) and ssh cannot be forwarded to the correct host by the overlay network.
2 [2017-08-09T11:37:09] <basz> ndpratas: yes it is a real problem. there are lots of use cases where you would want data to follow a container that runs on a random node (hence the docker acquisition of infinit). I believe there are others solutions out there then the one I have described but it’s an area that I am not too familiar with yet. research Data Volumes, or Flocker (but now deceased) like solutions.
3 [2017-08-09T11:38:38] <basz> ndpratas: docker containers are supposed to be stateless : [<-LINK->]

5 [2017-08-09T12:28:01] <basz> kamilorzelek: you must ensure it (db-data) exists on the host. (you’ll might also need to use an absolute path, not sure)
6 [2017-08-09T12:30:39] <basz> kamilorzelek: if the dir doesn’t exist the mount will fail and thus mysqld won’t start as it is missing its data dir

1 [2017-08-09T12:30:03] <Caroga> yuriy-yarosh: thank you for your explanation the other day. I did not got to see it until now. I was thinking, a container, only housing my code, does this has a valid reason to exist?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-09T13:36:42] <SISheogorath> Well, currently the only official ways to get this is by volume drivers. And the only officially supported or recommended drivers (as in "is production ready and well tested") are for Amazon\'s, Google\'s, and Microsoft\'s container cloud storage backends. So I guess that\'s not what you want. There are also some other storage providers like netapp who provide volume drivers but usually you need on of their proprietary storage backends to work. So for a FOSS storage solution there is no official or well proven way. I personally go for GlusterFS + Hostmounts but that\'s far from perfect. And you shouldn\'t do that when it comes to databases or something. Also I currently experiment right now with glusterfs and native mounting in docker (like in the NFS example). But not enough tested to recommend it. So all in all, I can\'t recommend anything right now for an on-prem solution. What you should keep in mind in case of NFS is that you have locking problems if multiple containers use the same file.
2 [2017-08-09T13:36:53] <SISheogorath> ndpratas: see above
3 [2017-08-09T13:38:29] <basz> ndpratas: no I don’t.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-09T14:14:01] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: Thank you for your great insight. I\'m new to all of this so experience from other users is all I can rely on, thank you again for taking the time. Now, I don\'t think I would have a problem with locking because I only run one instance at the time. What I want to be able to do is having a replicated container (1 replica) that changes nodes on the fly and have no problems accessing data that is persisted somehow. Think a DB for example. In my POC case I\'m running a docker stack with gitlab-ce that depends on 3 other containers (DB, redis, postfix relay) aside from the gitlab container itself.So far I have it running and configured just like I want it to be aside from having just 1 node in the swarm (I actually have two but one is in "drain" mode). All I want is to be able to have the two nodes running and making sure that even if one host machine dies it will just restart itself in the other node no problems. All and all, I want all containers FROM THE SAME STACK to be decoupled from the host they are running at. What would you recommend, or is really NFS the better way to to this for now until better drivers support come? I\'m also considering passing the NFS along with the volumes flag instead of mounting the NFS share in all host machines and then mounting a "local" path in volumes flag.
2 [2017-08-09T14:26:26] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: smarthost? I'm not familiarized with this term. What do you mean by that?
3 [2017-08-09T14:28:29] <SISheogorath> kamilorzelek: first of all please don't uselinks. They are dead and deprecated for multiple months now. Then add adepends_onstatement. After you done this, please usePMA_HOST=mysqlas environment variables for the phpmyadmin container
4 [2017-08-09T14:28:34] <SISheogorath> Then check again
5 [2017-08-09T14:28:51] <SISheogorath> ndpratas:  [<-LINK->] here you go
6 [2017-08-09T14:29:31] <SISheogorath> you usually use it for setup in dynamic IP ranges which are widely blacklisted
7 [2017-08-09T14:33:17] <SISheogorath> thomas-oo: you should be able to address your hostmachine from an internal docker network by using it's external hostname. So use it like an external host. In case of DNS this means you have to use the public address of your machine or (if you are lucky, I'm not sure about that) the first IP address of your subnet. But for the latter I'm neither sure how to configure it, nor if it actually works.
8 [2017-08-09T14:36:14] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: I'm using an open relay, no auth, no restrictions from the sender's ip. Since every runs on the same docker network I thought that would be the easier solution.BTW I'm also using links but since this is my first docker compose /stack file I just mirrored stuff I saw online. What should I do with links? Remove them? I read the warning docker page on links but didn't understand how should I adapt my file ( [<-LINK->] )
9 [2017-08-09T14:37:50] <SISheogorath> iirc in v3 links are ignored. So you should be able to delete them without a problem :X
10 [2017-08-09T14:39:08] <ndpratas> cool
11 [2017-08-09T14:39:23] <kamilorzelek> SISheogorath: Thx a lot. Solved.
12 [2017-08-09T14:41:36] <SISheogorath> ndpratas: as long as you don't expose 25 that's fine but doesn't solve the real problem. Mailserver require correct forward and reverse dns. which are usually bound to hosts and also advertised by your mailserver on connect while HELO. So your postfix instance needs to be aware of it's current hostname and your hostnames need to be configured correctly. (possible to do by mounting the right files, but something you have to be aware of, if you want to send mails to the internet)
13 [2017-08-09T14:47:44] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: I'm actually only using postfix as a relay to exchange because gitlab doesn't support SMTP with NTLM auth out of the box. Thus, I do the auth with postfix and just have an open relay for gitlab to send e-mail through... Yes, I do NOT expose 25, I use (used lol) links like you saw on my file and it is working... From the outside of the container I can't use that relay because there isn't a 25 port exposed on the nodes.
14 [2017-08-09T14:48:07] <SISheogorath> Ah in this case it's fine ^^
15 [2017-08-09T14:48:13] <ndpratas> I don't know if i am missing something or not, but I was happy because it is runnig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-09T14:19:24] <SISheogorath> Well, I wouldn\'t wait for "better plugins". Right now the persistence problem is addresses by the infinite team that docker acquired a few months ago (last year?). and they currently consider an experimental solution and of this or beginning of the next year. which means until it\'s stable there will be more than 1 year. Many people simply wrote their own volume plugins (it\'s not rocket science). All in all I would go for NFS if you already have a storage backend that is replicated. Otherwise my personal preference is (as already mentioned) glusterfs. And yes, I would go for volume flags in case you want to run stack-deploy.
2 [2017-08-09T14:20:13] <SISheogorath> One hint: If your postfix container switches the host and is not using a smarthost you run into a problem. otherwise it sounds fine

1 [2017-08-09T14:27:04] <thomas-oo> Hi, I have a question regarding network to network DNS resolving. Currently my set up involves 2 redis containers running in the default bridge network, and registrator and consul running in the host network. Registrator automatically registers containers started into consul as services. Then on the host network, I could dns look up <service>.service.consul and it'll resolve correctly. However, I want to start another service in the default bridge network that can also use the same consul dns server in the host network. How do I connect kind of, the bridge and the host network so that dns lookups resolve? Let me know if I'm not making sense
2 [2017-08-09T20:49:05] <thomas-oo> Could u supply the command u used to run ur web app in the container
3 [2017-08-09T20:56:38] <thomas-oo> I'm not an expert on docker myself but containers have an internal ip
4 [2017-08-09T20:56:52] <thomas-oo> my guess is that your app might be looking at the wrong ip
5 [2017-08-09T20:57:03] <thomas-oo> if you do docker network inspect localhost
6 [2017-08-09T20:57:14] <thomas-oo> you should see your two containers there with their ips
7 [2017-08-09T20:58:44] <thomas-oo> alternatively, try running both containers on the network "host"
8 [2017-08-09T20:59:10] <thomas-oo> I think that should allow you to call localhost just fine from your app
9 [2017-08-09T20:59:26] <astericky> ok cool beans will try that

When I use host as networking mode by--network=host, I can. tcp_fastopen is config on tcp layer so I want to configure in container via CI. Is it possible?
2 [2017-08-10T09:19:17] <SISheogorath> atsushi-ishibashi: use the--sysctlflag for the container
3 [2017-08-10T09:33:26] <atsushi-ishibashi> SISheogorath: I can find--sysctloption in docs. Butdocker run --sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=1 -it ubuntu /bin/bashshows the same errorno such file or directory

1 [2017-08-10T10:18:15] <przemolb> Hello all,
2 [2017-08-10T10:19:22] <przemolb> my question is more about design of docker  ecosystem  in companies.
3 [2017-08-10T10:19:59] <przemolb> How do you organise internal registry in case when you:
4 [2017-08-10T10:20:51] <przemolb> need to provide access to some external images internally but also restrict  what docker images can be installed internally
5 [2017-08-10T10:21:22] <przemolb> have a lot in-house built images which also can be installed on particular hosts
6 [2017-08-10T10:21:54] <przemolb> (by particular users so not everybody could run docker run ...)
7 [2017-08-10T10:23:05] <przemolb> Do you guys use docker registry  with builtin proxy  for this kind of  tasks ? If not how do you (in general) manage access to thousands of internal and external docker images ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-10T11:38:47] <basz> Hi,docker-machine createquestion. Is it possible to define the used storage-driver with the generic create driver?

1 [2017-08-10T13:49:29] <thomas-oo> Hi guys, I'm planning to use envconsul to watch KV entries in consul and use these to inject env variables into my containers
2 [2017-08-10T13:50:05] <thomas-oo> Only problem is, is there a way to share or pass certain env variables from one container to another? For now, assume they are both in the same network and the envconsul container can discover any other container
3 [2017-08-11T15:01:47] <thomas-oo> quick question, I want one of my docker containers in the bridge network to know the ip of my host
4 [2017-08-11T15:01:50] <thomas-oo> any tips?
5 [2017-08-11T15:02:04] <thomas-oo> do I have to pass in an env variable to the docker container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-10T15:28:47] <basz> to have docker swarm use a private network should I init a swarm like sodocker swarm init --advertise-addr={{ public_ip }} --listen-addr {{ private_ip }}:2377
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-11T01:49:04] <GavinHsueh> 11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-11T03:11:00] <SISheogorath> basz: the advertise-address should only differ from the listen-address when you use some kind of floating IP like you use in OpenStack setups
2 [2017-08-11T03:12:16] <SISheogorath> thomas-oo: well there is, but this way is deqd and should no longer be used. It waslinks. It would be better to talk to the docker engine API and gather the facts there
3 [2017-08-11T03:12:58] <SISheogorath> spences10: welcome to the docker side of life ;)
4 [2017-08-11T03:15:03] <SISheogorath> kamilorzelek: see [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-08-11T03:15:46] <SISheogorath> Also you can useHEALTHCHECKs to wait for a container to be up.
6 [2017-08-11T03:22:23] <SISheogorath> przemolb: right now I would say the easiest way to control what images come in and what images are allowed the best way to achieve this is building a simple CI process for these images on a machine that has full access to both registries and then pulls them from the public one, test them, and push them then again to the private one, where they go the usual way of staging and production.
7 [2017-08-11T03:23:15] <SISheogorath> I can't say it for our company, since we have full access to public registry, but that sounds like a good way to me.
8 [2017-08-11T03:24:25] <SISheogorath> atsushi-ishibashi: does it exist on the host/does it work to set it on the host with sysctl? If so I have to think about it a bit more
9 [2017-08-11T03:24:57] <SISheogorath> .-. I think I did my part for today :D time to rest a bit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-11T06:38:14] <atsushi-ishibashi> SISheogorath: I work on macOS. I can set bysysctl -w net.inet.tcp.fastopen=1. And when I ran docker container with--network=host, sysctl worked well.Btw thank you for help and have a nice day
2 [2017-08-11T11:25:10] <atsushi-ishibashi> SISheogorath: Yes. I trieddocker run --sysctl net.inet.tcp.fastopen=1 -it ubuntuanddocker run --sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=1 -it ubuntubut these two showed the same errordocker: Error response from daemon: oci runtime error: container_linux.go:262: starting container process caused "process_linux.go:339: container init caused \\"open /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen: no such file or directory\\"".
3 [2017-08-11T14:27:37] <atsushi-ishibashi> @SISheogorath Docker docs also saysNote: Not all sysctls are namespaced. Docker does not support changing sysctls inside of a container that also modify the host system. As the kernel evolves we expect to see more sysctls become namespaced.So what you're saying is right. I'm not familiar with namespaced so I'm researching how these configs like tcp_fastopen affect other process.Thank you very much, Sheogorath!
4 [2017-08-11T14:28:27] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
5 [2017-08-11T15:10:05] <atsushi-ishibashi> thomas-oo: How aboutcurl ifconfig.co?
6 [2017-08-11T19:15:44] <atsushi-ishibashi> vito-c: In macOS, it's possible by changing/private/etc/hosts. I don't know about other os..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-11T08:23:34] <basz> SISheogorath: should I use the private address for both then? (swarm is in same datacenter). ps thanks again!
2 [2017-08-11T09:46:40] <SISheogorath> basz: yes, you should
3 [2017-08-11T09:50:51] <SISheogorath> atsushi-ishibashi: so what was the command you used to start your container? Something likedocker run --sysctl net.inet.tcp.fastopen=1 someimage?
4 [2017-08-11T13:09:52] <SISheogorath> atsushi-ishibashi: I'm not completely sure about it, but it sounds reasonable that not all options are available in a namespace. for example when they are global and affect other namespaces as well when you change them. So tcp_fastopen is maybe one of them (I didn't find a source to verify this theory by a quick research but I sounds reasonable)
5 [2017-08-11T15:07:32] <SISheogorath> thomas-oo: I would say, yes. as long as you don't want to break the network isolation, you should use an env var
6 [2017-08-11T15:08:55] <thomas-oo> makes sense, thanks
7 [2017-08-11T15:09:04] <thomas-oo> and yea i do not want to break network isolation
8 [2017-08-11T15:09:22] <thomas-oo> I just need the ip address of the host as the host is the dns server for the container
9 [2017-08-11T15:12:45] <thomas-oo> gets some ip, but i can't ping to it
10 [2017-08-11T15:13:23] <thomas-oo> i have some private network as well so
11 [2017-08-11T15:13:38] <thomas-oo> for now I'll just pass an env variable, one wont hurt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-11T18:44:19] <vito-c> is it possible for docker to handle your host machine dns entries? for example let's say I have a service foo.bar mapping to port 8108 (so I can access it at 127.0.0.1:8108) and I want to be able to access it via my browser by going to [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-08-11T19:21:40] <vito-c> yah was trying to get around that requirement
3 [2017-08-11T19:25:09] <thomas-oo> vito-c:  [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-08-11T19:25:24] <thomas-oo> might be applicable
5 [2017-08-11T19:25:39] <thomas-oo> I believe in in the end, it does just add entries into your /etc/hosts
6 [2017-08-11T19:49:19] <vito-c> thomas-oo: I think it modifies /etc/resolv.conf on the host
7 [2017-08-11T19:54:03] <vito-c> thomas-oo: so I just need to run that resolvable container?
8 [2017-08-11T19:54:11] <spences10> I am struggle

14 [2017-08-11T20:01:53] <thomas-oo> I think you would run that container on ur host network
15 [2017-08-11T20:14:40] <vito-c> yah I ran the container and then went to foo.bar
16 [2017-08-11T20:14:42] <vito-c> but no dice
17 [2017-08-11T20:15:08] <vito-c> thomas-oo: were you doing this on osx?
18 [2017-08-11T20:15:16] <vito-c> did you use the systemd one or the first one?
19 [2017-08-11T20:18:52] <vito-c> I think with mac osx you can't mount directories inside /etc
20 [2017-08-11T20:21:31] <thomas-oo> vito-c: no, on rhel7
21 [2017-08-11T20:22:22] <thomas-oo> oh i didnt know you can't mount /etc dirs in mac
22 [2017-08-11T20:52:54] <vito-c> i think you can
23 [2017-08-11T20:53:02] <vito-c> you have to add it i guess

1 [2017-08-13T15:02:57] <arunma> Is there a way to restrict opening up the ports only for containers within the same network?Apologies if this question has been asked earlier and answered.  I have a docker compose.yml wrapping a Elastic and a Squid proxy container.  This is to simulate a corporate environment where I would be able to access Elastic only through a proxy. [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-08-13T15:04:36] <arunma> This works fine. When I configure the Squid proxy in my browser, I am able to access the ES IP (172.*) and execute queries.  However, when I don’t use my proxy, I am still able to access the ES container through the 9200 port (obviously, because I have exposed the port).
3 [2017-08-13T15:05:04] <arunma> Is there a way to open up the port only to the default network - which I see isesnetin this case?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-14T05:20:38] <SISheogorath> renegoretzka: how would you do it outside of docker? Docker is not magic that makes the inside project work. When you put a shitty software in docker it stays a shitty software. To update your MySQL schema it's maybe useful to not skip any major version while updating. And your error message sounds like there is a config mistake with your start parameter

Would be grateful for advice on getting everything I need into the environment.
2 [2017-08-15T17:23:20] <NickJames-minted> i know you're generally meant to split services up across containers but in this case they can't be decoupled because of job dependencies
3 [2017-08-15T17:45:14] <NickJames-minted> thomas-oo: I have created my own Docker image. But installing the specific dependencies has been far more difficult than expected. Appending my base OS image with the lines from the mysql dockerfile isn't working.

3 [2017-08-15T17:35:04] <thomas-oo> I suspect that at build time, it cannot access the internet? How do I fix this
4 [2017-08-15T17:35:20] <thomas-oo> On my host machine I can reach the yum repos just fine
5 [2017-08-15T17:35:48] <thomas-oo> This is not only a problem on the centos image but also on alpine, so I do not think it is due to the OS choice
6 [2017-08-15T17:37:15] <thomas-oo> NickJames-minted:  [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-08-15T17:37:45] <thomas-oo> You should create your own Docker image, choose a base OS image, then install specific dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-15T18:00:05] <thomas-oo> unfortunately so am I, for me my machine sits behind a proxy server isn't able to do apt-get or apk add etc
2 [2017-08-15T19:04:07] <thomas-oo> I'm still not able to do any yum install commands in my Dockerfile at build time.. I've looked into added in ENV http_proxy and https_proxy as per [<-ISSUE->] but it is still not working
3 [2017-08-15T19:04:26] <thomas-oo> Could not retrieve mirrorlist [<-LINK->] error was12: Timeout on [<-LINK->] : (28, 'Resolving timed out after 30546 milliseconds')

5 [2017-08-15T21:06:43] <thomas-oo> what is the equivalent of running docker run -P option
6 [2017-08-15T21:07:04] <thomas-oo> the publish all ports to random host ports, how do I do this in docker-compose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-15T22:50:41] <NickJames-minted> Anyone know how to install python-apt module? I am using hte official python dockerfile for 2.7.13 and debian keeps installing python-apt to the system python 2.7.9
2 [2017-08-15T22:50:55] <NickJames-minted> this one is killing
3 [2017-08-15T22:53:17] <NickJames-minted> looks like it's not supported on pypi- so is there just no way of getting python-apt to a newer distro of python without changing the system install?
4 [2017-08-16T02:39:29] <NickJames-minted> SISheogorath: Thanks, I went with using the debian base image. I didn't realize thatdebian:stretchships with 2.7.13
5 [2017-08-16T02:40:19] <NickJames-minted> pipis a not a supported distribution of thepython-aptpackage and fails relentlessly due to dependencies. The creator of the package firmly directs people to usingapt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-15T23:44:37] <SISheogorath> thomas-oo: simply use [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-08-15T23:44:58] <SISheogorath> don't specify what port should be used
3 [2017-08-15T23:48:39] <SISheogorath> NickJames-minted: the official python image doesn't use apt to install python and that's why apt installs python as a dependency for a package as it doesn't know anything about the self-compiled python version. I would suggest you to usepipto install the package of your choice or usedebianinstead ofpythonas base image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-16T03:14:02] <DWSR> Anyone in here that can guide me in the right direction with this? I'm trying to run a Docker Registry (usingdistribution/registry:master) as a service. When I run the container as standalone, it runs no problem and I can upload images to it. When I try to run it as a service, I getNo such imagewhenever the service tries to spin up a container. I have cleaned out all the images on the manager that I'm connected to viadocker rmi $(docker images -a -q) --force
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-16T04:17:13] <vecchp> is there any way to have a command trigger on every docker push?

1 [2017-08-16T14:54:59] <carere> Hello everyone :)
2 [2017-08-16T14:59:08] <carere>  [<-CODE->] I can post some code too if needed :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-16T18:14:30] <thomas-oo> carere: why is the host directory removing contents? I also use volumes and there's no removal of the contents
2 [2017-08-16T18:14:56] <thomas-oo> and yea, post the command for starting your service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-16T21:50:34] <ctlajoie> I have two containers (call them 'web' and 'redis') running on a host using the default bridge network mode. The redis container was run with-p 12345:6379. From the web container I amunableto connect to redis using<ip of host>:12345and I cannot figure out why. It seems to have something to do with iptables because if I stop iptables then it works fine. But docker is supposed to manage iptables rules so I still don't understand why this doesn't work...
2 [2017-08-16T23:04:24] <ctlajoie> thomas-oo: flushing all iptables rules and restarting docker worked. I just wish I could figure out why...I guess I will reset them and try removing rules one-by-one until I find the one that's blocking it.
3 [2017-08-16T23:56:44] <ctlajoie> thomas-oo: I was able to solve the problem by inserting a rule in the INPUT chain.iptables -I INPUT -i docker0 -j ACCEPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-16T22:40:29] <thomas-oo> Chris it is to do with iptables, I had the same issue, what I did was flush my iptable records and accept them all then I restarted docker service
2 [2017-08-16T22:41:41] <thomas-oo> But the better approach might be to connect the web container to the redis container using the internal ip of the redis container:6379
3 [2017-08-16T22:42:44] <thomas-oo> Docker network inspect bridge will show u the containers internal ip
4 [2017-08-17T13:15:17] <thomas-oo> ctlajoie: thanks! I'll keep that in mind

1 [2017-08-17T16:40:56] <doc-tongue> My docker swarm crashed and is stuck.  I lost a node and had too large a load on remaining node.  I cannot run a command it does not respond.  How can a restart docker without it auto deploying the stack that causes it to become unresponsive?
2 [2017-08-17T16:47:52] <doc-tongue> AnthonyWC: thanks.  I tried but it loads the stack it previously had
3 [2017-08-17T16:48:02] <doc-tongue> I had to leave swarm
4 [2017-08-17T16:48:11] <doc-tongue> then init a new one.
5 [2017-08-17T16:54:24] <doc-tongue> Sorry for the poor writing trying to get systems back on line.  Was in a rush

1 [2017-08-17T22:23:57] <vito-c> is it possible to log to stdout and to splunk??
2 [2017-08-17T22:24:12] <vito-c> i want docker logs <foo> to work as well as using splunk
3 [2017-08-18T18:50:19] <vito-c> SISheogorath: so right now it's not possible? by default?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-18T16:00:33] <SISheogorath> vito-c: when there is a logging driver for splunk that allows it, yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-18T18:58:31] <thomas-oo> Similar to this question: [<-LINK->] , I am using consul as well but I am trying to start a docker stack where I start a consul agent globally. However, consul needs an IP to advertise to other nodes, I want to use the container's host ip. How should I do this
2 [2017-08-21T14:34:43] <thomas-oo> 4doge: I'm not too familiar with docker cloud but as for running these two containers, just run them on your local machine using docker-compose. docker-compose.yml documentation is here: [<-LINK->] In your case, you'd have two services, your node.js project and an nginx image.
3 [2017-08-22T14:00:34] <SISheogorath> disabling iptables isn't a good idea. iirc docker requires iptables
4 [2017-08-22T14:01:04] <SISheogorath> for things like NAT and internal rewrites
5 [2017-08-22T14:01:13] <webertrlz> SISheogorath: Sorry I meant we have removed all custom rules. The iptables service is still present, but only docker is managing it.
6 [2017-08-22T14:02:05] <webertrlz> We set up a new cluster from with fresh new installs and we didn't even touch iptables to be sure it's not any custom rules.
7 [2017-08-22T14:04:03] <SISheogorath> Mhm if it still happens then, I would suggest to open an issue on github and hope to find more help there
8 [2017-08-22T14:05:59] <webertrlz> SISheogorath: I tried IRC and Docker forums, no success. I have found many similar issues on github and all of them without solution.I think they won't look into it as long as it's not reproducible. It happens a lot in production but not when I want it to happen.
9 [2017-08-22T14:07:17] <SISheogorath> I see. I guess as long as you don't have an EE subscription there won't happen much with a non-reproducible problem :/
10 [2017-08-22T14:08:27] <SISheogorath> I'm neither a docker official, nor a docker developer, so I guess I can't help you a lot here
11 [2017-08-22T14:09:35] <webertrlz> Yeah, I guess so. Until I can reproduce it I\'ll keep on "warming the wire" by pinging back when this happens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-21T22:05:06] <8Gitbrix> I'm new to docker, and I'm trying to run a local python file inside a docker container. How would I do that? When I call: docker run Imagename python3 localpathtofilename.py, it says [Errno 2] No such file or directory
2 [2017-08-21T22:28:32] <8Gitbrix> never mind I got it working, but it doesn't recognize any of the modules which i installed in the requirements.txt when creating the image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T07:28:08] <andela-cwekesa> 8Gitbrix: can you share your Dockerfile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T10:19:14] <carlosjgp> try something likedocker -w /myapp -v /host/folder/:/myapp/ python:3 python xxxx.pyIn this way you define the folder where you map your app as theworking folder inside the container
2 [2017-08-22T10:20:40] <carlosjgp> Actually there is an example quite similar on the docker hub website [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T11:59:57] <webertrlz> anyone experienced problems of communication between containers? I have this weird problem that always happens and no one knows anything about it
2 [2017-08-22T12:02:04] <webertrlz> I have an Overlay network (using consul, not swarm but I've seen this happen in swarm mode too).Container A tries to connect to container B, no response. Ping from A to B, no response.Then I  Ping from B to A, I get the ping responses, so the other connections from A to B starts working
3 [2017-08-22T12:02:30] <webertrlz> it happens in different datacenters, different overlay networks, different containers. Same problem.
4 [2017-08-22T12:05:23] <SISheogorath> Usually it's a firewall issue
5 [2017-08-22T12:05:41] <SISheogorath> I saw similar things happen while using digital oceans cloud firewall and swarm-mode
6 [2017-08-22T12:07:59] <webertrlz> I thought of that, but we have disabled iptables on the clusters that this happens, and its still the same
7 [2017-08-22T12:14:15] <webertrlz> InTheCloudDan: Could be. It's quite difficult to debug this. It looks like the sent packages don't reach the destination container so Arp is a good guess. I'll look into that.
8 [2017-08-22T12:16:19] <webertrlz> Thanks for the fresh thought@InTheCloudDan, i'll try to reproduce it (it happens kind of random)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T12:12:13] <InTheCloudDan> webertrlz: normally with something like that I would think ARP table, but I'm not familiar enough with docker networking
2 [2017-08-22T12:15:32] <InTheCloudDan> yeah in the case of A->B an invalid entry, then B arps for A when it's going to ping and refreshes everything, is a possibility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T19:25:06] <NickJames-minted> I'm having an issue with volume access in a container. I'm my entrypoint script runs an ansible playbook and I'm seeing some odd behavior. Anyone got a sec?
2 [2017-08-22T19:25:37] <NickJames-minted> My docker compose file sets volumes to share between the host and the container, and everything runs fine on my local, but not on my ubuntu ec2 instance
3 [2017-08-22T19:28:30] <NickJames-minted> one thing the container has to do is write a file for ansible to be able to sudo, which docker is trying unsuccessfully. I can add this file manually, but still see some weird behavior when Ansible tries to find files. This may be a question for Ansible people, but I figured someone here may have run into this since the only difference appears to be the docker-compose version (1.15 on my ec2, 1.14 on my mac)
4 [2017-08-22T20:01:44] <NickJames-minted> here's my docker-compose block:
5 [2017-08-22T20:02:17] <NickJames-minted>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-08-22T20:03:31] <NickJames-minted> the python module I want to install lives in the/usr/local/airflow/bivolume
7 [2017-08-22T20:05:24] <NickJames-minted> myentrypoint.shscript tries to run a few pip installs like this:
8 [2017-08-22T20:05:47] <NickJames-minted> pip install -e $DEPLOY_PATH/bi/m_jobs/sake/ --user
9 [2017-08-22T20:06:16] <SISheogorath> Is$DEPLOY_PATH/bi/writable to for the user you use in the container?
10 [2017-08-22T20:07:24] <NickJames-minted> so the question i have is about those permissions actually
11 [2017-08-22T20:07:42] <NickJames-minted> when I dols -lafrom inside the container the owner isusers
12 [2017-08-22T20:08:29] <SISheogorath> usually it is a question of permissions ^^
13 [2017-08-22T20:08:34] <NickJames-minted> yea I agree with you
14 [2017-08-22T20:08:51] <NickJames-minted> but i've never see ownership show up asusers:rootbefore
15 [2017-08-22T20:08:58] <NickJames-minted> i run a non-root user in my container
16 [2017-08-22T20:09:06] <NickJames-minted> so in my dockerfile I've added that user to the grouproot
17 [2017-08-22T20:09:13] <NickJames-minted> and am hoping that it gains write permissions
18 [2017-08-22T20:09:36] <SISheogorath> can you run it withls -ln?
19 [2017-08-22T20:10:04] <SISheogorath> And then check that the uid is the same when you runid -u
20 [2017-08-22T20:10:30] <NickJames-minted> yea it's the only non-root user so it's 1000
21 [2017-08-22T20:10:45] <NickJames-minted> but for that directory it's 1010!
22 [2017-08-22T20:10:47] <NickJames-minted> hmmm
23 [2017-08-22T20:11:02] <NickJames-minted> 1010:0
24 [2017-08-22T20:11:05] <SISheogorath> there is your problem :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T19:59:15] <SISheogorath> NickJames-minted: I'm not sure what you try, can you share your Dockerfile and entrypoint script and explain a bit more detailed, what you try and what doesn't work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-22T20:11:49] <NickJames-minted> so where is the best way to set htese permissions? The volume isn't actually mounted until after the image is built, so I can't do it in the dockerfile, and by the time I'm in my entrypoint script I'm running as non-root user
2 [2017-08-22T20:12:02] <NickJames-minted> this worked natively on my local
3 [2017-08-22T20:13:43] <SISheogorath> the official images solve these problems by starting as root, chown the directories and then drop the permissions usinggosu(notsudoorsubecausesudoandsucreate issues with signals)
4 [2017-08-22T20:15:03] <SISheogorath> I personally set the uid for my images to a fixed value and chown the directories on the machine before running them
5 [2017-08-22T20:15:12] <SISheogorath> that's a question of your choice
6 [2017-08-22T20:18:36] <NickJames-minted> i see. I'd like to try that approach. The only issue is that these files are actually being used by the host at the moment
7 [2017-08-22T20:18:48] <NickJames-minted> an unprivileged user
8 [2017-08-22T20:19:06] <NickJames-minted> so chowning them would break the processes running on the host
9 [2017-08-22T20:19:41] <SISheogorath> that's unperfect .-.
10 [2017-08-22T20:19:53] <NickJames-minted> hah yes I fully admit that.
11 [2017-08-22T20:20:10] <NickJames-minted> I'm basically transitioning an environment into a docker container in piecemeal fashion
12 [2017-08-22T21:09:38] <NickJames-minted> i think the easiest thing to do is get those pip packages out of the repo altogether
13 [2017-08-22T21:10:18] <NickJames-minted> while it's frustrating, i tend to agree with the idea that hte container should not be editing files in the host filesystem
14 [2017-08-22T21:10:52] <NickJames-minted> and I'm not explicitly trying to write anything. I'm just trying topip install -e /path/to/python/package --user

4 [2017-08-23T14:23:07] <ndpratas> because I don't really want to specify the node this time around. I just want every container to run on the same node
5 [2017-08-23T14:23:58] <ndpratas> do you happen to know how can I do that?

8 [2017-08-23T14:29:33] <SISheogorath> yep
9 [2017-08-23T14:29:55] <ndpratas> "same node" like Whatever node as long as they are deployed together lol

1 [2017-08-23T10:16:19] <gluxix> Всем привет! Делаем микросервис на Docker. Нужно чтобы один контейнер (FROM alpine) коннектился к AP Wi-Fi другого устройства. Как это из под контейнера сделать? Испольщуем Node.js и для управления wi-fi - npm модуль node-wifi, с реальной машины проблем нет.
2 [2017-08-23T10:17:10] <gluxix> Ups
3 [2017-08-23T10:20:23] <gluxix> Sry :D Hello all! We are doing microservice with Docker. The docker container (FROM alpine) need connect to other device Wi-Fi. We use node.js (node-wifi for network managment). How we can do it from docker container? (It’s work fine on real machine).
4 [2017-08-23T11:10:35] <gluxix> Actually, we need get access to wireless interface of host machine. Docker must be able to manage host wifi iface. For examle: this microservice receive http request (within REST) from user (or other microservice) and the container must connect to other WiFi AP.
5 [2017-08-23T11:11:51] <gluxix> … and the container must connect to other WiFi AP within HOST’S wireless iface
6 [2017-08-23T11:15:31] <gluxix> SISheogorath: :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-23T10:56:21] <SISheogorath> Wifi in a docker container? I would go for changing network/network_mode to host and add CAP_NET_ADMIN (which makes the container like privileged mode) and see what happens. Should work then like outside a container
2 [2017-08-23T10:56:32] <SISheogorath> But doesn't make a lot of sense to me
3 [2017-08-23T11:15:05] <SISheogorath> Sounds crazy :D I like it ^^

1 [2017-08-23T20:41:35] <jpreese> Question: How can I mount the current directory to a directory in the container? I've tried running docker run -v /${PWD}:/tmp --rm -it --name my-container myimage bash   as well as some alternatives, but no luck. My goal is to set up a development environment, so the host location isn't always going to be known (unless we're forced to state one)
2 [2017-08-23T20:42:33] <jpreese> So I'd like to be able to share the host current directory with a directory in the container so the files are accessible by both. This way I could say.. create source code on the host machine and compile it in the docker container
3 [2017-08-23T21:33:21] <jpreese> Answer: "%cd%"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-23T21:46:48] <johndoeneu_twitter> Can docker swarm scale to more than 1000 nodes?
2 [2017-08-23T21:47:02] <johndoeneu_twitter> I see many articles referring to 1000 as the max
3 [2017-08-23T21:47:50] <johndoeneu_twitter> Thus does it imply it shouldn't be used for a production website?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T05:55:24] <sabrehagen> johndoeneu_twitter: that's a large size swarm. I don't know if 1000 is the cap. However I'm interested in your workload that requires 1000 nodes. Could you share?
2 [2017-08-24T05:55:32] <sabrehagen> I'm really stuck on a problem. I've put my repro steps here. Can anyone figure this out? [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-08-24T15:06:39] <sabrehagen> Is this a docker issue, or some other part of my stack? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T09:03:58] <SISheogorath> johndoeneu_twitter: if you referring to [<-LINK->] it simply an example size. There is no technical reason why docker swarm should be limited to 1000 nodes
2 [2017-08-24T13:27:15] <SISheogorath> You can usedocker cp containerid:/path/in/container /local/path

1 [2017-08-24T13:21:56] <w9n> hi, im currently using custom containers that i manually have to attach to volumes to create and restore backups. Is there any integration i didnt see? something like docker volume backup/restore <name> <path> via remote api would be fantastic....

4 [2017-08-24T14:45:47] <brunorpinho> hahaha
5 [2017-08-24T14:46:16] <amanagarwal2189> or the whole thing would have gone down!! they will fix it in a jiffy
6 [2017-08-24T14:47:11] <brunorpinho> the docs are fine, it is just the main page
7 [2017-08-24T14:47:54] <amanagarwal2189> yeah.. even hub is doing fine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T14:44:56] <amanagarwal2189> yep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T15:26:10] <jpreese> If we have a recommended way that we'd like the consumers of our docker images to run our image, is it just common practice to put it up on dockerhub? Or is there a way to provide a run script so all they need to do is docker run image, where run would actually have a lot more parameters to it.. or some other process?
2 [2017-08-24T15:26:37] <jpreese> For example, if I wanted a dotnet environment and mount the current directory so they could work on code on the host machine then build it in the container, I\'m doing.. docker run -v "%cd%":/root/dev -it --name dev-dotnet-docker microsoft/dotnet:latest bash
3 [2017-08-24T15:29:53] <amanagarwal2189> jpreese: i guess bith the ways should be fine... but that would be really helpful if other community members can comment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T15:38:20] <SISheogorath> jpreese: docker runisdocker run. Not more.atomicprovides such a functionality using an install and run label, but native docker ignores it.
2 [2017-08-24T15:38:59] <SISheogorath> In general you should avoid these things or provide a docker-compose file to stay transparent
3 [2017-08-24T15:40:10] <jpreese> I was under the impression that compose was mostly for multiple services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-24T18:08:57] <8Gitbrix> andela-cwekesa: I fixed it. To run a local file in a docker image I useddocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir dockerimagename python filename.py
2 [2017-08-24T18:09:08] <8Gitbrix> and got it working

Is there a way to force a service to stay on one node in swarm mode? Also specifying 127.0.0.1:5000 doesn't really make sense if the service is replicated and need to access the image in local repository from VM. Can someone help with this?
2 [2017-08-27T19:02:03] <MarkoShiva> guys any idea how to setup EndPoint in dnsrr I get this errorport published with ingress mode can't be used with dnsrr modewhe try to deploy my stack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-25T00:06:23] <amanagarwal2189> jpreese: yes it can also run multiple services. but it is a cleaner and straight-forward way to start a container
2 [2017-08-25T00:06:59] <amanagarwal2189> your customers do not need to go through thedocker runcommand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-27T15:22:31] <Karl-EdwardFPJeanMehu> vinifala: Try changing the permissions for the directory you're trying to create the volume in. If you're running on Mac / Linux you can use the chmod command

1 [2017-08-28T12:18:35] <UniFreak> Hi, I’m trying to set up a lemp stack, I decided to build a nginx image, a php-fpm image, but one question remained: say I have three project: api.sample.com, erp.sample.com and fin.sample.com, should these three project have their own image?
2 [2017-08-28T12:19:08] <UniFreak> And how can I configure docker so that they all can access other project by domain name?
3 [2017-08-28T12:21:17] <UniFreak> adaliszk: I read lots of tutorial on docker, they all seems to access project in docker via ip
4 [2017-08-28T12:21:33] <UniFreak> can I access them in my host by domain name?
5 [2017-08-28T12:21:54] <adaliszk> sure, if you use some server likenginxwhat you mentioned before the containers
6 [2017-08-28T12:22:41] <adaliszk> so you should have a "proxy" which will handle the domain itself and will forward the requests to the desired container
7 [2017-08-28T12:23:09] <adaliszk> also with this proxy you could show a nice "in maintenance" page when your container is down for some reason
8 [2017-08-28T12:23:45] <UniFreak> So, basicly I will have those container: nginx, php-fpm, my three project and a proxy?
9 [2017-08-28T12:24:54] <adaliszk> you can use nginx as your proxy
10 [2017-08-28T12:25:38] <adaliszk> btw I recommend to use php with litespeed in your containers, literally about 2x as fast than fpm
11 [2017-08-28T12:25:52] <adaliszk> (phpearth/php:litespeed)
12 [2017-08-28T12:26:28] <UniFreak> Thanks but for now I’m just trying to get a enviroment mirroring my company’s production env
13 [2017-08-28T12:26:44] <adaliszk> sure
14 [2017-08-28T12:30:15] <UniFreak> adaliszk: what should I do to let that nginx proxy forward request made by my host machine? forward all 80 port request to it?
15 [2017-08-28T12:32:59] <adaliszk> UniFreak: somethink like this: [<-CODE->]
16 [2017-08-28T12:34:28] <adaliszk> ofc you can use your local container ip address like172.17.0.1:80
17 [2017-08-28T12:35:05] <adaliszk> then your container should take over and handle the request by himself with whatever server you build into it
18 [2017-08-28T12:37:35] <adaliszk> also if you search for you can find automatic scripts which will generate this vhost config for you using ENV varables
19 [2017-08-28T12:39:29] <adaliszk> and@amanagarwal2189yes, they should be on the same network or they output has to be published on the hosts
20 [2017-08-28T12:40:33] <adaliszk> change theserver_nametoerp.sample.comand you are good to go
21 [2017-08-28T12:41:51] <adaliszk> it depends on where the domains are pointed, if they are pointed nowhere or somewhere else you should override them to your localhost
22 [2017-08-28T12:42:21] <adaliszk> then your local server can resolve the domain names which will eventually pass you to your containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-28T12:20:09] <adaliszk> proxy_pass?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-28T12:30:11] <amanagarwal2189> i guess even container name/ service name is sufficient for establishing a network (all containers should be in the same network)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-28T12:39:44] <UniFreak> I’m not sure you understand my problem: I want to access the php projects using their domain name likeerp.sample.comin myhost machine. your paste seems like a typical nginx site configuration
2 [2017-08-28T12:41:17] <UniFreak> do I need to edit my host machine’s host file, to point those domain name to that proxy’s ip?

1 [2017-08-29T16:57:42] <MarkoShiva> what is a proper way to start a swarm. I usedocker swarm init --advertise-addr my-laptop-lan-address-on-wifiI have a pretty tedious project to work on. The services work correctly one with each other in the stack deploy also tests work properly in drone.yml. However if I'm targeting my own lan address with curl to test the bashserver it hangs sometime.

3 [2017-08-29T17:02:13] <MarkoShiva> maybe to post it as a snipet: [<-CODE->] The compose runs without problem and deploy mode too just I'm not sure why it hangs sometime. It uses overlay network should I specify VIP or DNSSR as endpoint mode? Also I read somewhere that for dnsrr I need to not have explicitly exposed ports in compose file maybe that is wrong I'm still learning advanced docker topics.

1 [2017-08-31T00:34:18] <hanchenyi> hi guys. Does anyone know how to fix port conflict. When I docker run these two rest containers, I set --endpoint equals to localhost:10003 and localhost:10004. Currently these two can not run together. After I start one of them, I try to start the other container, the error in logs metions that port 8080 already in use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-08-31T00:59:01] <echiphn> hanchenyi: I think that you get wrong port mapping. it should be -p 10003:8080 -p 10004:8080

1 [2017-09-01T13:44:35] <lrcorrea> Hi guys. I installed docker on windows 10 and when rebooted windows does not start anymore, someone has already seen this problem?
2 [2017-09-01T18:36:33] <lrcorrea> brentarias: I did a restore and started it again. Really not good.  thanks Brent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-01T16:36:12] <brentarias> lrcorrea: Not heard of this.  Try starting in safe mode?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-01T16:48:39] <brentarias> I\'m reading "Docker on Windows" (Elton Stoneman). The book suggests that I use a Docker image, containing IIS, to launch multiple ASP.NET web sites each in its own container;  therefore each web site would not share an app pool (full isolation) even though all of them are in the IIS default app pool.  This sounds great from a simplicity POV, but this sounds like a memory liability.  It sounds like I would be running several instances of IIS in memory simultaneously (each within its own container), rather than running IIS as a single process.  From a memory-efficiency POV, isn\'t that a bad thing?

1 [2017-09-02T11:52:21] <SISheogorath> HussainMirahmadi: Sounds like a in-container error. Since docker itself doesn't use curl. You should contact the image vendor
2 [2017-09-02T12:43:37] <SISheogorath> that the container terminated itself

1 [2017-09-04T12:00:45] <igor-ramazanov> Hi, everyone!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-04T12:00:47] <igor-ramazanov> Is there some ready tool for supervising and upgrading of docker containers.It should upgrade container by polling for commands from remote server with ability to specify its CLI arguments.And also it should restart container in case if it failed, and if it failed several times, it should run an old version of container with old arguments.
2 [2017-09-04T12:34:04] <igor-ramazanov> And another question - is it possible - update a docker container from inside itself?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-04T22:47:13] <denizs> themirrortruth: the optimal solution would be to use some orchestration tool like cloudformation or kubernetes to roll out immutable updates, whenever you introduce major changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-04T22:50:43] <danieldram> Anyone avail to help troubleshoot an issue? I am all out of ideas
2 [2017-09-04T23:11:26] <danieldram> I have an issue where when I try to build with docker-compose it says the Dockerfile is empty but it is in the same directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-04T23:09:36] <neetjn> Hey doods
2 [2017-09-04T23:10:11] <neetjn> I know this isn't necessarily the correct room, but seeing as to I can't find any NGINX discussions:
3 [2017-09-04T23:10:24] <neetjn> I'm having some trouble running NGINX dockerized.
4 [2017-09-04T23:10:44] <neetjn> It's reading my config fine, volume linking is gravy.
5 [2017-09-04T23:10:50] <neetjn> But it's not actually working.
6 [2017-09-04T23:11:05] <neetjn> I have another dockerized application running on my server, that's forwarded to port 5000. Should I link the containers, or should it not matter (I'm assuming it shouldn't).
7 [2017-09-04T23:12:12] <neetjn> danieldram: is this in version control?
8 [2017-09-04T23:13:16] <danieldram> Not sure what you mean, my docker version is 17.06 and docker-compose is 1.16
9 [2017-09-04T23:13:38] <neetjn> I'm saying is this on GH or on Bitbucket so I can pull it down and check it out?
10 [2017-09-04T23:14:29] <danieldram> ah unfortunately, I can't upload the code
11 [2017-09-04T23:14:36] <danieldram> IP..
12 [2017-09-04T23:14:43] <danieldram> not my project
13 [2017-09-04T23:15:06] <danieldram> But when I installed docker and docker-compose, it won't build it. I can attach the files though
14 [2017-09-04T23:15:16] <danieldram> for docker-compose and dockerfile if that helps?
15 [2017-09-04T23:31:43] <danieldram> I have no idea what to do
16 [2017-09-04T23:32:08] <danieldram> I installed a new docker, I see both files, they are legit. I run docker-compose build and it says the Dockerfile is empty. I'm on mac osx
17 [2017-09-04T23:48:18] <danieldram> Is anyone having this issue?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-05T04:03:11] <amanagarwal2189> hey people... is there a docker-compose.yml equivalent ofdocker run --user=demo_user:group1 <image_name> <command>

1 [2017-09-05T10:24:40] <SamwiseUP> hello. docker noob here. Trying to setup reverse proxy with nginx-proxy to host multiple sites on a single host running docker.nginx-proxy is running fine. created two containers of wordpress sites to test.I’m able to access test1.dev but test2.dev gives me 502 bad gateway. Not sure what the problem is.I made sure to give differnet names for the wp container as well as the database containers. Virtual Host is setup correctly I think. Do the containers have to be exposing different ports? they are both exposing port 80
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-05T13:01:13] <elcolie> Hi. I need your opinion on my question. [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-05T14:29:27] <SISheogorath> elcolie: check the value of$HOMEinside the container when running as postgres user. There should be one
2 [2017-09-05T14:34:08] <SISheogorath> themirrortruth: Maybe a bit late, but restarting a container can be done by--restart=alwaysor--restart=on-failureparameter and it's equivalent in docker-compose. Also when you deploy it as docker service (swarm-mode) It'll be provided automatically. When it comes to automated updates, the general advice is to do it by version control or similar, but if you go for mutable tags: [<-LINK->] This is what I used in some previous projects
3 [2017-09-05T18:21:31] <SISheogorath> amanagarwal2189: Check the logs. Sounds like a permission issue. The often appear when you run container with bind volumes
4 [2017-09-05T19:42:15] <SISheogorath> simple reason:/var/lib/postgresql/data/is a volume. volumes can't be modified after they are defined
5 [2017-09-05T19:43:00] <SISheogorath> rightisleft: See [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-09-05T22:00:29] <SISheogorath> Because that are bindmounts, which have various pros and cons. You should avoid them in general
7 [2017-09-05T22:03:50] <avierax> ok thanks, any place where those differences are listed?

12 [2017-09-05T23:59:55] <avierax> If I have two containers in different networks both with the same name
13 [2017-09-06T00:00:04] <avierax> and I have a container connected to those two networks
14 [2017-09-06T00:00:27] <avierax> how do I refer to one or another?

16 [2017-09-06T00:01:46] <avierax> is there a way to quality the container by prepending or appending their network name
17 [2017-09-06T00:01:49] <avierax> ?
18 [2017-09-06T00:13:45] <SISheogorath> Not that I know. But usually you can't use a name twice. So this situation only appears ehen you use the alias function of a network
19 [2017-09-06T00:14:12] <avierax> well let me explain myself better
20 [2017-09-06T00:14:22] <avierax> I have two instances of the same compose
21 [2017-09-06T00:14:30] <avierax> each is isolated from each other
22 [2017-09-06T00:15:11] <avierax> and I want to proxy those two compose from an external container, the only one that is exposed to the internet
23 [2017-09-06T00:16:01] <avierax> I need to connect those the proxy to those two networks
24 [2017-09-06T00:16:14] <avierax> and then refer to each of these containers by a name
25 [2017-09-06T00:16:40] <avierax> what name would that be?
26 [2017-09-06T00:16:51] <avierax> they have the same name in their private network
27 [2017-09-06T00:17:31] <avierax> but when I connect a third container to those two networks, how to make that third container refer to each one of them separately
28 [2017-09-06T14:40:54] <avierax> is there a way to express in compose that a port should be published and specify its interface but not its destination port?
29 [2017-09-06T14:41:38] <avierax> something like can be done using docker command line when issuing docker run -p 127.0.0.1::80, for example

1 [2017-09-05T21:23:25] <avierax> why knows why does launching a container with a mounted directory does not populates this directory with what's already in that mount point in the image?

1 [2017-09-06T03:39:07] <shyam334> Question: Is there a way to access the labels of a parent image, during the build time.
2 [2017-09-06T14:18:56] <SISheogorath> shyam334: Labels are outside of the image scope. You can't access them inside your container
3 [2017-09-06T14:20:09] <SISheogorath> avierax: compose assigns to every deployed version a prefix. Usually it's the name of the directory, but you can specify it by using the-pflag
4 [2017-09-06T23:55:56] <shyam334> SISheogorath: thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-06T11:52:37] <elcolie> SISheogorath: Thanks. I will give it a try. Right now I solves it byparallel. Expensive solution takes my RAM nah
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-06T14:25:19] <lenixlobo> Is there a way to limit specifically only the stack and data segment memory inside the docker image? I tried -m , ulimits and cgroups ,they restrict the entire memory access but the stack and data segment cannot be specifically restricted.
2 [2017-09-06T15:40:46] <lenixlobo> Actually,I meant to run a container inside which I want to run an operation but with limited stack and data segment memory allocation.@
3 [2017-09-06T15:40:50] <lenixlobo> @SISheogorath
4 [2017-09-07T01:55:23] <lenixlobo> SISheogorath: is there no other way? Using ulimts ,cgroups? Or something else?
5 [2017-09-07T01:56:03] <SISheogorath> swamifalgun: check [<-LINK->] and of course [<-LINK->]
6 [2017-09-07T02:00:24] <SISheogorath> lenixlobo: you have to keep in mind that on a machine level the stack are simply a few containers that may or may not share a directory or a network stack. How will you set limits this way? Besides network and volumes, which are both optional, they share nothing, they don't even have to run on the same machine
7 [2017-09-07T02:02:10] <SISheogorath> Keep in mind that these limits work on kernel level and not as part of docker, which could may know what container is assigned to a stack
8 [2017-09-07T02:03:06] <SISheogorath> monksy: sounds like missing ca-certifices
9 [2017-09-07T09:17:20] <SISheogorath> VQuery: I would suggest you to go to forums.docker.com with that question. Possibly there will be more Windows users
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-06T15:38:08] <SISheogorath> lenixlobo: you mean set a general limit for a stack and then set a more specific limit for services inside this stack? That's currently not possible, no. (okay, in theory you could run dind but that's nothing you should do in production)
2 [2017-09-06T15:40:35] <SISheogorath> avierax: I would say no, but the best way to do so is trying it. Also an option it maybe works with a compose file using long syntax for ports. See [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-09-06T15:40:40] <SISheogorath> maybe it works ^^
4 [2017-09-06T15:42:17] <SISheogorath> lenixlobo: right now you can only specify limits for specific containers, not for an entire stack.

3 [2017-09-07T12:02:36] <SISheogorath> huangyanxiong01: you shouldn't run docker commands inside a Dockerfile. It's not made for this. If you want to use multiple images for your application please have a look at multi-staged builds [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-09-07T17:08:08] <SISheogorath> Ah@monksyI had to checkout your link >.> Their instructions are not correct. They tell you to copy the cert.pem, use the fullchain.pem. If you want to verify useopenssl s_client -connect host:portbut as I already see: They provide an incomplete certificate chain which breaks the trust
5 [2017-09-07T17:08:30] <SISheogorath> Use the fullchain.pem and the problem should be solved

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-07T17:21:41] <JavaMonkey_twitter> when setting up my local docker environment I want to establish the correct hostname for each container so that ssl traffic is handled properly. It seems that container_name in my docker-compose file dictates my docker network dns name. So, what is the hostname property for, if not to map the correct dns name?
2 [2017-09-07T18:17:31] <JavaMonkey_twitter> After more reading, I think what I need to do is setup an alias on a pre-existing network.
3 [2017-09-07T18:19:56] <JavaMonkey_twitter>  [<-CODE->]
4 [2017-09-07T18:20:05] <JavaMonkey_twitter> but that doesnt seem to work

6 [2017-09-07T18:21:16] <monksy> that fixed the issue! thank you
7 [2017-09-07T18:21:22] <JavaMonkey_twitter> even though I have declared my network in my compose file
8 [2017-09-07T18:21:24] <monksy> SISheogorath:
9 [2017-09-07T18:24:52] <JavaMonkey_twitter> Is it possible to setup an alias for my container on a pre-existing network in my docker-compose file?
10 [2017-09-07T18:26:45] <SISheogorath> you can add it under network and mark it as external
11 [2017-09-07T18:27:14] <SISheogorath> See [<-LINK->]
12 [2017-09-07T18:28:42] <JavaMonkey_twitter> SISheogorath: , so, I have done that. And have been using the external network for some time. Now I want to create a container alias on that network in my services description. Thats what Im struggling with.
13 [2017-09-07T18:30:13] <JavaMonkey_twitter> Is that possible? If so, whats the right syntax in my container description?
14 [2017-09-07T18:31:32] <SISheogorath> it should work like that the error message "undefined network" indicates it\'s more likely a typo
15 [2017-09-07T22:08:13] <SISheogorath> Well, it depends on the filessystem, storagedriver, image size, number of layers, entrypoint script, volumes, …

1 [2017-09-07T20:47:14] <tasuki> Hi guys, what could be the reason thatdocker run -it someimagetakes ~10 seconds to start the web server on my laptop and 15 minutes (and counting!) to create a container from the same image on AWS ECS (anm4.largewhich is sitting with idle cpu and empty memory)?
2 [2017-09-07T20:48:04] <tasuki> ah, fwiw, on my laptop the speed of this is 100% cpu limited
3 [2017-09-07T20:55:49] <tasuki> docker statsdoes not help...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-08T05:36:47] <huangyanxiong01> SISheogorath: thank you,hat's what I want
2 [2017-09-08T07:24:03] <huangyanxiong01> lostllama: you need share C drives  to   virtual machine
3 [2017-09-08T07:27:36] <huangyanxiong01> oh,You can ssh to virtual machine  then  check  C drives  is mount to Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-08T06:24:11] <lostllama> Can anyone tell me how to map a local folder into docker in the latest version? I used to do something likedocker run -it -v C:/work/web-dashboard:/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build atlassian-docker, and while that option allows persistent changes between container launches, it doesn't map to the folder like it did in the previous version.
2 [2017-09-08T06:40:54] <lostllama>  [<-ISSUE->] I've come to believe it's a bug, so I've registered it as an issue.
3 [2017-09-08T07:24:25] <lostllama> It was already shared. The fact is, the same command that works with 17.06.1 doesn\'t work with 17.06.2. The drive shows up in the settings as "shared" in both cases. Unless the update to 17.06.2 somehow broke that sharing but didn\'t reflect it in the UI.
4 [2017-09-08T07:28:14] <lostllama> What virtual machine? I'm running docker on my Windows machine.
5 [2017-09-08T07:28:59] <lostllama> I'm fairly certain that it's a bug in Docker.
6 [2017-09-08T07:30:49] <huangyanxiong01> Docker run in  Hyper-v Linux virtual machine on windows 10
7 [2017-09-08T07:31:15] <huangyanxiong01>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-08T07:32:39] <lostllama> OK, but regardless of that, running the command to map a folder doesn't work on 17.06.2, but uninstalling that and reinstalling 17.06.1 and running the same command worked flawlessly, as it had been before I installed the update for 17.06.2 today. Does that not strongly suggest that it's a bug with Docker?
2 [2017-09-08T07:33:18] <huangyanxiong01> I don't konw is bug, I generally work with Linux
3 [2017-09-08T07:34:12] <lostllama> I've never needed to configure anything regarding hyper-v, etc. other than granting Docker access to enable it. So I'm not sure how that stuff works. I think I'll just keep using 17.06.1 until they fix it.
4 [2017-09-08T07:34:25] <lostllama> Thanks anyway.
5 [2017-09-08T07:34:31] <huangyanxiong01> mybe,You can create issue on github
6 [2017-09-08T07:34:46] <lostllama> The issue I linked above is the issue I created on github :-)
7 [2017-09-08T07:36:00] <huangyanxiong01> well good
8 [2017-09-08T09:28:57] <lostllama> What happens if you run:wget http://mirrors.163.comon the host machine?
9 [2017-09-08T09:29:06] <lostllama> does it download an html file or fail? It works for me so I'd hope it would work for you.
10 [2017-09-08T09:39:51] <huangyanxiong01> you  can choose othen mirrors
11 [2017-09-08T09:40:04] <huangyanxiong01> othen == other

1 [2017-09-08T09:55:50] <SISheogorath> 14mar1983: Maybe #ci-cd in the docker community Slack is the better place for this question. See [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-09-08T10:53:40] <SISheogorath> zhongdj: I'm not sure. Why not simply try it? If it works fine, if ti doesn't you have your answer
3 [2017-09-08T13:08:41] <SISheogorath> orionprateek: networking. Use the other container like a remote computer and use the containername as hostname.
4 [2017-09-08T13:12:55] <SISheogorath> anshulpatel25: Depends on how much you trust in ubuntu's apt-get. It's not an official tool by docker, but [<-LINK->] basically works. I personally don't use it, since I do integration testing which is from my perspective enough for the docker image itself
5 [2017-09-09T04:00:01] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: simply usecommand: "--flag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-08T13:13:53] <anshulpatel25> thanks@SISheogorath, If I may ask, how do you perform integration testing, are you using any kind of framework, for eg: BATS ?
2 [2017-09-08T13:14:39] <anshulpatel25> or the image is deployed on integration environment, and then test-cases are executed?
3 [2017-09-08T13:15:47] <SISheogorath> Well, for my private projects I use just a bunch of Bashscripts to test basic functionalities (so basically smoketests) :D For a professional environment I use the same test cases I use for the software usually and run them against the image.
4 [2017-09-08T13:16:20] <SISheogorath> so yes, the image is deployed to test environment
5 [2017-09-08T13:16:54] <SISheogorath> this is one of my private projects: [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-09-08T13:56:04] <danbopes> What\'s the best practice for building apps to be deployed to docker? The app needs to be built first, so I\'m thinking "npm install --dev && npm build" locally, run "npm install" via the RUN command? Or should I build the app directly on the docker image?
2 [2017-09-08T14:07:57] <danbopes> What do you mean instantiate the container?

4 [2017-09-09T18:24:03] <matthewharwood> I made a more formal question
5 [2017-09-09T18:24:19] <matthewharwood> Sorry for these seemingly noob questions this is like day 2 of using docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-09T18:23:38] <SISheogorath> matthewharwood: how would you do it outside of a container?
2 [2017-09-09T18:25:05] <SISheogorath> the question is still: How would you do it outside of docker? Because there is actually no difference in handling it
3 [2017-09-09T18:25:45] <matthewharwood> npm install cors --save
4 [2017-09-09T18:25:57] <matthewharwood> is how I do it outside
5 [2017-09-09T18:26:12] <matthewharwood> the problem is the npm install is running only when I make the image
6 [2017-09-09T18:27:06] <matthewharwood> do I need to keep my node_modules local in the volume for development?
7 [2017-09-09T18:27:15] <matthewharwood> that the only way?
8 [2017-09-09T18:27:27] <matthewharwood> or can i run them from the container?
9 [2017-09-09T18:27:48] <matthewharwood> right now I'm runnig them from the container but I cannot update them.
10 [2017-09-09T18:28:02] <SISheogorath> well, you install it this way, but you don't monitor the package.json for changes. Which is another usecase. anyways: When you want to run npm install, simple prefix it with:docker exec -it <containerid>so you can something likedocker exec -it mycontainer npm install cors --save
11 [2017-09-09T18:28:35] <matthewharwood> ahh I see
12 [2017-09-09T18:28:36] <matthewharwood> hmm
13 [2017-09-09T18:29:14] <matthewharwood> I don't want the developer to have to interact too much with the docker container.  is there anyway to watch the package.json ?
14 [2017-09-09T18:29:25] <matthewharwood> so they can do it local but it will trigger in the container also?
15 [2017-09-09T18:29:31] <SISheogorath> you can search for ionotify
16 [2017-09-09T18:29:48] <SISheogorath> But that's nothing docker specific
17 [2017-09-09T18:31:06] <matthewharwood> I can come up with a solution.  the exec -it command helpped a lot.  it's simple
18 [2017-09-09T18:31:28] <SISheogorath> nice :)
19 [2017-09-09T18:32:01] <SISheogorath> when you solved it feel free to blog about it so others can learn from it ^^
20 [2017-09-09T18:36:01] <matthewharwood> SISheogorath: in npm install theres a postinstall scriptinstall, postinstall: Run AFTER the package is installed.maybe kind of lame but I could right a script to godocker exec -it <containerid>and npm install also lol
21 [2017-09-10T01:49:58] <SISheogorath> neetVeritas: iirc not within the registry problem, but you can use a reverse proxy that blocks some actions in front

4 [2017-09-12T02:19:07] <AyushyaChitransh> It says thatcontent-core.jarwas missing some dependencies. I think that content-core.jar was not prepared properly
5 [2017-09-12T02:20:06] <prasenjithaty> AyushyaChitransh: the issue here is authorization while downloading that jar from our private Nexus repository
6 [2017-09-12T02:21:12] <prasenjithaty> That jar is defined as a dependency in pom.xml
7 [2017-09-12T02:31:06] <AyushyaChitransh> prasenjithaty: I haven't used authorization hence hadn't came across this issue. I am not sure if there is something wrong with the maven image or something else.

1 [2017-09-13T06:31:22] <marcuzy> Hi, guys! Did somebody face a problem which is running stateful replicas? I have a microservice which consumes RabbitMQ queue and sends messages to Slack through http API, this miscroservice is something like "gateway". Messages contain teamId, the microservice keeps all tokens, it gets a token by teamId and sends a message to Slack using a correspond token. It works great while there is one instance of the microservice. To scale the microservice I can change the replicas number and use "round-robin" feature of RabbitMQ, but the order of messages isn\'t strict anymore for each particular user because queues in different replicas are independent.Maybe somebody has some experience with such a problem-solving. Thank you.

1 [2017-09-13T20:28:57] <DWSR> Hey everyone, I'm having trouble with the Docker Swarm Overlay network when deploying a Stack using a Compose file. When I have all my containers on one worker node (setting all other nodes to Drain), I can talk between containers no problem. When I set all nodes to active and redeploy the same stack (so that containers end up on different nodes), the containers can no longer talk to each other. The DNS does not seem to work correctly. Is there something I should be doing here?
2 [2017-09-17T02:08:52] <DWSR> marcuzy: But Kafka actually specializes in this. You are able to ensure delivery order in Kafka because of its architecture, while RabbitMQ does not always guarantee this (as you're finding out). I would highly recommend that you look further into how the architectures between the two differ. You will find that Kafka is actually much more suited to your scale than RabbitMQ.
3 [2017-09-17T02:09:28] <DWSR> We are looking at RabbitMQ for things, but it's single provider multiple consumer, so we need the cursor support more than anything else.

2 [2017-09-14T09:27:38] <Everspace> Is there a reason against that practice?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-14T09:26:08] <SISheogorath> you shouldn't do bind mounts for files, but yes, should be possible.
2 [2017-09-14T09:48:27] <SISheogorath> One is because docker by default creates a directory if the file doesn't exist (if you use docker run, in swarm mode it's a bit different) and iirc it was also some kind of permission related but not sure about that in detail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-14T17:14:21] <SISheogorath> onerealfunnyguy: you need to address the services on the host machine like an external host. The network stacks isolated so for your container everything on the host's network stack is another machine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-16T15:47:43] <marcuzy> @DWSR thank you for your answer, but I mean a little different and Kafka solves another problem (I didn\'t know about it). The problem is I want a strict order for particular team\'s user and to save universality of replicas that RabbitMQ gives messages using "round-robin" strategy and any of the replicas can handle it. But if I send two messages simultaneity to the same user, one of them will be gotten by one replica, second of them will be gotten by another replica and the second replica can send the second message earlier than the first that is a bad behavior.One of the solutions is creating separate queues for each team. Unfortunately, this solution generates a lot of queues (thousands in my case) and I don\'t sure this is a good idea. However, I tested the solution with 10k queues and a performance is quite good but a control via web plugin isn\'t friendly. I wonder to keep a small amount of queues and keep replica\'s universality (there is solving that gives each replica a range of teams to handling). If I don\'t find a solution I going to use this one.

I\'m wondering how configurable are docker images? I currently work on Symfony 2 app and would like to "dockerize" it, but my app requires few php modules not usually included in PHP & also few other things, for instance imagemagick. How would one handle such things? Should I be building my own custom images?

1 [2017-09-21T08:52:14] <crebuh> Hi Guys, I'm running my docker environment behind an nginx reverse proxy which is servering the container applications to the outside world. In case I'm updating my containers, they are not accessible from the outside on port 80 or 443 for let's say one minute. Is there a way within docker to avoid this short downtime or should I just redirect all request via nginx to a maintenance page or something similar? What is best practice in this case?
2 [2017-09-21T08:53:31] <airtonix> crebuh: you want to research load-balancing and green/blue deployments
3 [2017-09-21T08:54:10] <crebuh> airtonix: thanks!
4 [2017-09-21T08:54:42] <airtonix> crebuh: as i see it, you'd have things running at foo.com, and then uploading a new container it needs to run alongside old container at uat.foo.com, confirm all is good and switch nginx pointers to new container.
5 [2017-09-21T08:55:07] <airtonix> crebuh: i'm sure there are tools around to automate this
6 [2017-09-21T08:57:00] <crebuh> yes this is the idea
7 [2017-09-21T08:57:04] <crebuh> I will check  it out
8 [2017-09-21T08:57:19] <crebuh> the idea having two environments on production sounds reasonable

10 [2017-09-21T08:58:14] <airtonix> crebuh: join the rancher slack channel and ask the guys there
11 [2017-09-21T08:59:30] <crebuh> awesome thanks
12 [2017-09-21T09:12:13] <crebuh> is there a way to file the contents of an image for example when it is stored in the gitlab registry?
13 [2017-09-21T09:12:45] <crebuh> during build I'm copying some config files, but it seems that there s a problem but I cannot check the content of the image
14 [2017-09-21T09:13:36] <crebuh> the issue is that the container/app is  crashing on start because a config file is not in place
15 [2017-09-21T09:13:56] <crebuh> when I use docker ps I can see the process shortly and then it dissapears
16 [2017-09-21T09:14:21] <lostllama> have you tried manually starting it using the -i flag (i.e. accessing it interactively)?
17 [2017-09-21T09:15:25] <crebuh> no how can I do this?
18 [2017-09-21T09:15:54] <lostllama> What command do you usually use to launch your docker image?
19 [2017-09-21T09:16:36] <crebuh> yeah this is a bit complex, I have a make file which is doing this here: [<-CODE->]
20 [2017-09-21T09:17:15] <crebuh> on the staging environment I'm just pulling to ready to go images from the gitlab registry
21 [2017-09-21T09:19:14] <lostllama> Hmm, I'd recommend just pulling the image locally (if possible) and then running it with something likedocker run -it IMAGENAME(and any other relevant startup flags).
22 [2017-09-21T09:19:32] <crebuh> mmhm I see
23 [2017-09-21T09:19:42] <lostllama> Doing so will connect you to the standard input / output from the container, so you should then be able to look around once it crashes.
24 [2017-09-21T09:20:00] <crebuh> at least I have access to the log of the container
25 [2017-09-21T09:20:17] <crebuh> so It is throwing this: [<-CODE->]
26 [2017-09-21T09:20:37] <crebuh> so the problem is the config file which seems somehow corrupt or not in place
27 [2017-09-21T09:21:10] <lostllama> Is the config file part of the container, or on a mapped volume?
28 [2017-09-21T09:22:29] <crebuh> it is part of the container and will be copied during build from src/ to the bin/ folder
29 [2017-09-21T09:23:23] <crebuh> depending on the environment the application then will choose the correct file, on development every thing is working fine (there I'm building the images always from scratch) on staging where I just want to pull the images from gitlab it is not working
30 [2017-09-21T09:25:45] <lostllama> Have you confirmed that the "writing configuration" step has succeeded? It looks like it should be working, so I\'m a little confused by it
31 [2017-09-21T09:28:06] <crebuh> Yes I think I have found the isse in my staging.env file I was storing the environment values with additional "" which then will break my staging.json

1 [2017-09-21T10:37:34] <SISheogorath> VQuery: Sounds like a jenkins problem to me, not like a docker problem. Maybe contect them? I don't see where docker is involved here besides providing the container for the application.
2 [2017-09-21T10:41:32] <SISheogorath> I don't know, I'm not a Jenkins user. But to me it looks likedocker-slave-584a5b1ec73cis the container name -> hostname inside the container which breaks. You should contact someone from the Jenkins community/support

1 [2017-09-25T11:39:20] <crebuh> Hi Guys, I want to dockerize an php-application. Before I just worked with node-applications. So for the php-application my question is if I need also a web-server installed inside the container (preferable nginx) to make the application available to the outside world? On the main-system I have installed nginx also so not sure what is the best practice there. Any ideas or suggestions?
2 [2017-09-25T11:44:36] <crebuh> yes this is what I'm doing for the need apps as well
3 [2017-09-25T11:44:52] <crebuh> the node apps are started in the container and expose a specific port to the host system
4 [2017-09-25T11:50:01] <crebuh> ok I got it, I was just not sure if I need a webserver (apache or nginx) inside the container to start the application or do what ever is necessary
5 [2017-09-25T11:50:27] <crebuh> so basically I dont even need a CMD command in my Dockerfile right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-25T11:42:44] <thedrint> crebuh: IMHO, setup your host nginx as reverse-proxy to provide reqests from Internet to dockerized php
2 [2017-09-25T11:45:43] <thedrint> dockerized php exposes 9000 port (if you use php-fpm). and host nginx must have fastcgi_pass localhost:9000 in nginx.conf file (or IP:9000 if you set up container with bridge network)
3 [2017-09-25T18:20:55] <thedrint> mcarpenterjr: htop for host processes, ctop show info about containers in realtime (use docker stats)
4 [2017-09-25T18:21:46] <mcarpenterjr> ah I see

3 [2017-09-25T13:43:28] <SISheogorath> I wouldn't completely recommend that, because it breaks the idea of containers and images of being immutable besides configurations

1 [2017-09-25T17:47:45] <hmatt1> how do I check how much memory/CPU is allocated to docker as a whole from the linux command line?

3 [2017-09-25T17:49:35] <hmatt1> if you were in the GUI, its under settings
4 [2017-09-25T17:49:53] <hmatt1> not how much it is using, but what the limit is in the docker settings
5 [2017-09-25T17:50:17] <hmatt1> I was looking atdocker statsbut that breaks it down by container

1 [2017-09-26T13:01:49] <kdiogenes> Is there any boot2docker with XFS and quota support?
2 [2017-09-26T13:09:15] <rsegecin> yes@SISheogorath
3 [2017-09-26T13:13:57] <rsegecin> I mean when you have to configure the volume you need to write the mounting points source and destination
4 [2017-09-26T13:14:45] <rsegecin> actually "a volume" not "the volume"
5 [2017-09-26T13:18:43] <rsegecin> as in docker composeservices:[name of the container]:volumes: [<-CODE->]
6 [2017-09-26T13:20:37] <SISheogorath> Well, you only need to do that for bindmounts, You can also use named volumes or unnamed volumes
7 [2017-09-26T13:21:48] <SISheogorath> And there is no way to automatically copy them, because the docker client only talks to the docker server. which then setups up all the paths and things. So the docker client isn't really aware of what the paths actually mean
8 [2017-09-26T14:42:48] <SISheogorath> well, since it's recommended to not use bind volumes, yes. The recommendation is to use named volumes with volume drivers which use an external storage backend like efs on Amazon or netapp on-prem.
9 [2017-09-26T14:43:36] <SISheogorath> bindmounts have various disadvantages compared with volumes
10 [2017-09-26T15:02:25] <SISheogorath> rsegecin: what "service files"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-26T14:40:49] <rsegecin> SISheogorath: so it's not possible to deploy on a remote machine specifying the volume source without having to copy the files to the node before hand?
2 [2017-09-26T14:53:30] <rsegecin> SISheogorath: ok I understood. But even them with a efs configured I'd still need to copy the service files to that system wouldn't I?
3 [2017-09-26T15:03:23] <rsegecin> SISheogorath: the files that I need for the container to work with
4 [2017-09-26T15:20:23] <rsegecin> SISheogorath: that\'s what I needed but as I\'m doing a small project and I still don\'t know how to configure this "deployment pipeline" I came across this problem where I wanted to update something really small and if docker automatically update those files it would facilitate a lot. I guess this is a next step that I\'ll take in the future.
5 [2017-09-26T15:30:30] <rsegecin> it looks like a milestone from where I'm but thank you anyway =D
6 [2017-09-26T15:34:07] <rsegecin> Thank you@SISheogorath,  thank you@carlosjgpby the suggestion, I guess I'll just compile a new image with the change for now, when I try to create a pipeline I'be back here
7 [2017-09-26T15:34:13] <rsegecin> thank you guys

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-26T14:56:17] <carlosjgp> rsegecin: You can use distributed storage, like S3, to mount a volume on your Docker container [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-26T15:05:55] <SISheogorath> You usually have your sourcecode on your GitHub/GitLab repository, let a CI pipeline build your images, deploy your images to the server instances and only the data is stored in volumes. In case of leagcy applications you maybe add some configs to the image or mount them by bindmount and copy them there using ansible, puppet or what ever CD system you use or even better, when you use docker swarm you can use config objects. When you run microservices following the 12factor.net rules, you simply use environment variables and docker secrets. So nothing else is needed ._.
2 [2017-09-26T15:06:20] <SISheogorath> I don't see where there is a need for the docker client to bring things over
3 [2017-09-26T15:22:25] <SISheogorath> You can checkout this project of mine: [<-LINK->] We provide a basic configuration with the image and generate the remaining parameter from environment variables and defaults on startup
4 [2017-09-26T21:54:21] <SISheogorath> igorbarkowsky: do you also recreate the volume?
5 [2017-09-26T21:55:06] <thedrint> SISheogorath: no, volume was untouched
6 [2017-09-26T21:57:00] <SISheogorath> Mhm do you have a link to the sources of your volume driver?
7 [2017-09-26T21:58:09] <thedrint> SISheogorath: i don't use compose, if you asked about it.
8 [2017-09-26T22:00:23] <thedrint> I've open issue at docker-nginx on github. But not sure that is nginx image bug
9 [2017-09-26T22:05:32] <SISheogorath> Well, when you use the alpine image for example?
10 [2017-09-26T22:06:05] <SISheogorath> does it appear there too?docker run --rm -it -v myvolume:/app alpine /bin/sh
11 [2017-09-26T22:09:46] <thedrint> No, with alpine image app/ mounted correctly, 775 1000:1000
12 [2017-09-26T22:11:55] <thedrint> Looks like nginx during install chown and chmod /usr/share/nginx/src (app/ on host)
13 [2017-09-26T22:57:08] <SISheogorath> that's possible, do you use the official nginx:latest image or an unofficial one?
14 [2017-09-26T22:59:23] <thedrint> SISheogorath: official.This is workaround for described situation [<-CODE->]
15 [2017-09-26T23:09:55] <SISheogorath> yes,  seems to be an nginx image problem. They should be able to help when you open an issue :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-26T20:21:37] <thedrint> I have a question with named volumes
2 [2017-09-26T20:23:24] <thedrint> When create one with local-persist driver and map it to some directory in user home, app/ for example. app/ has permissions 775 and 1000:1000
3 [2017-09-26T20:26:02] <thedrint> Then i've run new container with nginx:latest with this new volume as /usr/share/nginx/html. Container change permissions of app/ to 755 0:0 (e.g. root)
4 [2017-09-26T20:27:38] <thedrint> I've change permissions to 775 1000:1000 again recursively. Copy my files inside. All good and works.
5 [2017-09-26T20:29:38] <thedrint> But when i re-create container (change nginx config for example) with docker stop-rm-run, permissions to app/ (only for app/ ) 755 0:0 again.
6 [2017-09-26T20:30:18] <thedrint> If i simply re-run container with docker stop-start, all fine.
7 [2017-09-26T20:33:44] <thedrint> With shared folders never see the same :(

1 [2017-09-27T04:19:57] <ebcodes> is there a way with supervisord to promote a subprocess' shell to the foreground?
2 [2017-09-27T04:20:20] <ebcodes> within a docker container of course
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-27T10:31:32] <SISheogorath> ebcodes: acording to [<-LINK->] there issupervisorctl fg <process>
2 [2017-09-27T10:32:22] <SISheogorath> it's the same as outside of a docker container. Keep in mind the container only provides the environment for your software. Not more, not less. No magic involved
3 [2017-09-27T14:20:55] <SISheogorath> rsoeldner: do they run in different containers?
4 [2017-09-27T17:41:48] <SISheogorath> Well, this can't really work because you need to run supervisord first before you can attach the application
5 [2017-09-27T17:42:03] <SISheogorath> in general it's not a good idea to do this
6 [2017-09-27T17:42:16] <SISheogorath> but it's possible
7 [2017-09-27T17:44:44] <ebcodes> what would be a better approach?
8 [2017-09-27T18:40:49] <ebcodes> pretty sure supervisord is not the right answer here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-27T13:47:30] <rsoeldner> I receive strange  errors inside a docker container. My jvm application writes files to disk and directly call another process with a system call. Is it possible that filesystem isn't synchronized and subprocess tries to read a not flushed file ?
2 [2017-09-27T14:23:16] <rsoeldner> SISheogorath: no, same but found the failure. Sorry for not getting back its not realted to docker.
3 [2017-09-27T17:35:50] <ebcodes> SISheogorath: : seems like I'm getting aunix:///tmp/supervisor.sock no such fileerror
4 [2017-09-27T17:36:05] <ebcodes> entrypoint in docker file:ENTRYPOINT ["supervisorctl", "-c", "/src/docker/supervisord.conf", "fg app"]

3 [2017-09-27T19:24:18] <SISheogorath> ebcodes: depends on your setup. You should usually try to split up all your process into own containers. If that's not possible use supervisord
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-28T06:52:24] <orangelynx> it certainly is possible, see here: [<-LINK->] . I cannot tell you however to configure your Mac for multiple ips.

1 [2017-09-28T11:34:12] <Richard87> Hi guys! I'm running Nginx+PHP-FPM these days on my vps, but I'm thinking about migrating our apps to docker/kubernetes... Is there any recommandations on using php-apache vs php-fpm+nginx? Any benchmark-tests or best-practises?  (I feel that php-apache would be easier to setup, but I prefer nginx' config files...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-28T12:28:08] <saviour123> Is there a way to set password on a docker deployment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-28T14:24:11] <thedrint> Richard87: with nginx you must reload it all times you chage config. For example when you add some rewrite rules. With apache you can add rewrite to hraccess and it works immediatelly without restart apache
2 [2017-09-28T14:54:49] <thedrint> Richard87: php-apache containter has bigger image and it slower than php-fpm. And all hates apache:)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-28T15:26:50] <Richard87> that makes me even more torn :/ I never update my config, so that's no problem, and I'll stopp all containers and launch new ones whenever I refresh the app anyway... BUT I was planning on copying in all my files into my container... But I don't know if nginx can access the files if they are inside the php-fpm container?
2 [2017-09-28T15:27:20] <SISheogorath> VQuery: you shouldn't install java on a boot2docker instance. it's a minimal OS and comes iirc even without a package manager. If you want to use java on such a machine, put it in a container
3 [2017-09-28T15:29:46] <SISheogorath> Richard87: as@igorbarkowskyalready pointed out. Both work. If you are already familiar with nginx and php-fpm that's the better way to go for you. If not, I would suggest to use the Apache combo. If you know neither Apache, nor nginx, apache is easier to start, nginx better to master :D
4 [2017-09-28T15:31:28] <Richard87> hehe, thanks@SISheogorath! I know both... But I'm not familiar with Docker, so I wonder what is mostly used in docker php-apps :)
5 [2017-09-28T15:32:06] <SISheogorath> I would say php-fpm.
6 [2017-09-28T15:32:29] <Richard87> Alright, thanks mate!
7 [2017-09-28T15:32:57] <SISheogorath> when you look at the official images, that's mainly used. Simply because it's more microserviced :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-28T16:38:06] <thedrint> @Richard87But I don't know if nginx can access the files if they are inside the php-fpm container?Maybe, volumes_from: directive in docker-compose.yml helps you. [<-CODE->]

1 [2017-09-29T02:46:50] <JoinBugs> hello, i'm starting in docker and i have a project in python, i manage its dependencies with virtualenv, so reading many tutorials the recommendation is install virtualenv inside the docker image, but if i have my virtualenv in the host machine, why do not just copy using copy or add commands and not build a new virtualenv?
2 [2017-09-29T03:31:07] <JoinBugs> Oo, I was not in perspective, Thanks so much@AyushyaChitransh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-29T03:02:12] <AyushyaChitransh> JoinBugs: The point of using a docker container is to create a virtual environment. I mean you don't need a virtualenv. Do you?
2 [2017-09-29T03:03:34] <AyushyaChitransh> And if you do then you can simply mount an existing virtualenv inside container. That would be much easier. Because copy will create two instances, and every file will get copied individually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-09-30T14:30:28] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: yes, it sends a SIGTERM and after 30 secods (by default, but can be changed) it kills the process. Notice: It only sends the SIGTERM to the PID 1 in the container. So you have to take care of the rest. This often causes problems when people don't use the right tools in theirENTRYPOINTstatements.
2 [2017-10-01T18:09:51] <SISheogorath> jeud: depends on where you store your source code.VOLUMEis probably not what you search for. It only persist the data that is inside the container at the mentioned path
3 [2017-10-01T18:11:59] <SISheogorath> Usually you useCOPYor  get/clone it from you version control. If you talk about a local development environment, you may want to bind-mount it into a running container using the-vparameter withdocker run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-01T02:11:51] <thedrint> @Richard87Hi guys! Are there any proxies (nginx, kube-proxy, ingress?) that have "retry logic" on specific responses from the container?I\'ve read yesturday on nginx.org about upstream options. In commercial subscribe nginx has some useful options like resolve. In upstream {} section (under http{} section) you can define pool of servers to response. And then you define at location{} section defined upstream. For example, you can set [<-CODE->] And in location [<-CODE->] Docker service in compose.yml has option "restart" too, if you want proxy try to up after fails.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-01T15:52:14] <AyushyaChitransh> jeud: Naah, If you don't need the older image too, then you can simply rebuild the newer image with the same tag

1 [2017-10-02T06:42:59] <rsoeldner> Good morning. While running my application inside a docker container I sometimes receiveIllegal Instruction, exit code 132.

Can someone provide help ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-02T09:24:41] <Richard87> Hi guys! I need some more advice :/ My "Build context" is 1.25gbs, even though my source-code is around 50mb (including images/assets etc), I\'m using .dockerignore to remove all logs and vendorfiles etc, what else can I do to limit the size?
2 [2017-10-02T09:28:27] <AyushyaChitransh> Richard87: Are there any hidden files that could have gone in context?
3 [2017-10-02T09:29:07] <Richard87> no, there is only .git and .idera, and they are both added to .dockerignore
4 [2017-10-02T09:31:45] <Richard87> (I have also used Disk analytics to look for big files, there are none..
5 [2017-10-02T09:38:06] <Richard87> well, it makes perfect sense :(docker build .ignores .dockerignore ..
6 [2017-10-02T09:38:28] <Richard87> checking/var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder156883376and all my files are there..
7 [2017-10-02T10:19:32] <Richard87> AyushyaChitransh: Thanks for helping! Leading/messed up everything, I removed those and now it worksalotbetter ;)
8 [2017-10-02T10:20:59] <Richard87> wow, this actually works _alot faster :O
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-02T09:46:52] <SISheogorath> rsoeldner: looks like the your architecture your application is compiled for doesn't match the one your run underneath. Usually happens in ARM environment because there are various ARM versions out there (it's a nightmare) if your image runs and fails after a while you probably have added a binary for a different architecture.
2 [2017-10-02T12:24:48] <SISheogorath> Are you on a non-x86_64 CPU? and if so, what base image are you using?@rsoeldner
3 [2017-10-02T12:25:10] <SISheogorath> Also check back that your process doesn't fail because of missing permissions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-02T10:36:43] <rsoeldner> SISheogorath: thank you! To fix this the workflow must be an entryscript which pulls sources and build it ?
2 [2017-10-02T10:37:49] <SISheogorath> usually it's better to simply build the docker image on your architecture. Keep in mind you need an base image that supports the architecture
3 [2017-10-02T11:00:15] <rsoeldner> SISheogorath: oh sry, but my image was build & run locally. I have no idea why this happens, I use some SSE instructions in my application binary. But they are available inside docker (checked by proc/cpuinfo)
4 [2017-10-02T12:49:28] <rsoeldner> SISheogorath: no its x86_64 its gcc-6 base image. The process exits with error code 132
5 [2017-10-02T12:51:00] <rsoeldner> But it only fails inside my docker container on the same machine i build it. If i run it outside the docker image, it works perfectly. I don't get it. Maybe there is some memory corruption that causes this problem ?
6 [2017-10-02T13:04:18] <SISheogorath> As I said, probably missing permissions. check what capabilities your process has outside of docker and inside of docker
7 [2017-10-02T13:11:25] <SISheogorath> See: [<-LINK->]

1 [2017-10-02T18:26:49] <mahenrique94> Good afternon guys, How do to proxy a DOMAIN for ports ? e.g: mysql.domain.com.br redirect to server_mysql:3306 or ssh.domain.com.br redirect to server_ssh:22, any sugestions ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-02T19:35:03] <SISheogorath> mahenrique94: what you search is a SRV record. But that has nothing to do with docker
2 [2017-10-02T19:36:47] <SISheogorath> Also you have to check that the software you want to use with these "Domains" know how to use SRV records
3 [2017-10-02T22:02:03] <SISheogorath> since the "local" volume driver has a type field now, simply mount it, using it. Keep in mind that you probably run into problems with local caching and missing ability of Lockfiles
4 [2017-10-03T10:07:37] <SISheogorath> PhoenixMage: it's listed bydocker info
5 [2017-10-03T10:10:15] <SISheogorath> jeud: depends on your environment. If it's a development environment, maybe. If it's a production environment: Everything that is not data should be part of the image. Take a look at [<-LINK->] as reference
6 [2017-10-03T10:11:21] <SISheogorath> There should be an array
7 [2017-10-03T10:14:11] <SISheogorath> Mhm okay  no longer there
8 [2017-10-03T10:59:30] <SISheogorath> I can't say, I'm using overlay2
9 [2017-10-03T22:00:54] <SISheogorath> depends on where you run it. If it's about selfhosting a prometheus stack is probably the way you want to go. (But I don't run it myself so can't say for sure) Otherwise I would also recommend Datadog as Cloud-based solution, but it's pretty expensive. Everything else I can think of right now is more improvised or also cloud based and nothing I used until now
10 [2017-10-04T14:49:39] <SISheogorath> how do you try to pull?
11 [2017-10-04T14:51:14] <ndpratas> docker pull hostname:5000/blabla:latest
12 [2017-10-04T14:51:34] <ndpratas> the same as I do with push but with pull
13 [2017-10-04T14:51:40] <ndpratas> same command
14 [2017-10-04T15:06:41] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: Good question. Let me see
15 [2017-10-04T15:09:29] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: nothing on the logs. btw I can pull the image from the registry on the remote host
16 [2017-10-04T15:09:53] <ndpratas> I just changed the hostname to localhost
17 [2017-10-04T15:09:56] <ndpratas> worked... wtf
18 [2017-10-04T15:10:08] <ndpratas> pinging the server works as well
19 [2017-10-04T15:10:21] <ndpratas> I don't know what the issue is
20 [2017-10-04T15:52:46] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: the thing is.... it is correct lol
21 [2017-10-04T16:02:23] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: no. I just checked and the /etc/hosts is the default one,nothing is added. Therefore when I ping the hostname it must be using the DNS
22 [2017-10-04T16:05:55] <SISheogorath> is your fqdn in there?
23 [2017-10-04T16:06:22] <SISheogorath> or what ever you used as "host" in your pull?
24 [2017-10-04T16:22:06] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: how so?
25 [2017-10-04T16:23:04] <ndpratas> I used: docker pull example.domain.com:5000/bla/blabla:latest
26 [2017-10-04T16:23:08] <SISheogorath> usually the fqdn of a machine should be place inside its/etc/hostsfile
27 [2017-10-04T16:23:19] <ndpratas> you're right
28 [2017-10-04T16:23:25] <ndpratas> I don't manage these machines
29 [2017-10-04T16:23:45] <ndpratas> but It should work nonetheless because it can indeed ping itself
30 [2017-10-04T16:23:50] <ndpratas> (DNS)
31 [2017-10-04T16:25:31] <ndpratas> SISheogorath: Like I said, I just edit the /etc/hosts file and nothing changed
32 [2017-10-04T16:26:01] <ndpratas> [DONT WORK] docker pull example.domain.com:5000/bla/blabla:latest[WORK] docker pull localhost:5000/bla/blabla:latest

1 [2017-10-03T02:48:10] <jeud> i'm using node.js and expect to config docker compose, should i install npm packages locally and map entire path to the container or somehow install npm packages when loading the container ? please guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-03T08:14:53] <PhoenixMage> How can I check to see what storage drivers my particular instance of docker supports?
2 [2017-10-03T10:10:25] <PhoenixMage> SISheogorath: I thought that only listed the active one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-03T10:20:06] <PhoenixMage> SISheogorath: Docker with aufs doesnt support POSIX ACLs does it? according to the aufs website they do but maybe Docker or the version I am on with ResinOS doesnt...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-03T17:08:23] <kdiogenes> someone knows about any script to detect underused running docker containers?
2 [2017-10-03T17:11:01] <kdiogenes> I'm thinking in writing a script to parsedocker statsand implement rules to decide if a container is underused or not
3 [2017-10-03T21:30:20] <kdiogenes> Not using CPU or network for a long time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-03T19:47:03] <SISheogorath> underused like using less memory than allowed?
2 [2017-10-03T21:42:55] <SISheogorath> I don't think that a script is the right way to do that. That's what monitoring is for
3 [2017-10-03T21:43:10] <SISheogorath> Get the metrics and set a threshold
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-03T21:44:13] <kdiogenes> Do you recommend any monitoring solution for this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-04T08:01:03] <hazim1093> Hi, does anyone know what's the difference betweenactionandstatusindocker events?
2 [2017-10-04T08:01:24] <hazim1093> they both seem to have the same values
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-04T14:40:30] <ndpratas> I set up my private registry
2 [2017-10-04T14:40:33] <ndpratas> net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
3 [2017-10-04T14:40:40] <ndpratas> does anyone have a clue?
4 [2017-10-04T14:42:33] <ndpratas> I get that error trying to pull an image (which I pushed to the registry fromanotherhost) FROM THE SAME HOST where the registry is running
5 [2017-10-04T14:44:33] <ndpratas> so, the registry is running, cool.i can push an image from a random host across the network, coolI can't pull the image from the same host where the registry that is running on,notcool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-04T14:54:50] <SISheogorath> What does the registry logs say?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-04T15:14:09] <SISheogorath> sounds like a routing problem. A possible solution is to correct your hostname mapping in/etc/hosts
2 [2017-10-04T15:53:11] <SISheogorath> you mapped the hostname to localhost on that machine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-05T07:32:22] <rkdls> is there any project integration docker and machine learning  ?
2 [2017-10-05T07:39:54] <racinmat> yes, for some machine learning projects, there is docker image, but mostly, as far as I know, docker haven't penetrated machine learning field as heavily as software development.
3 [2017-10-05T07:40:35] <racinmat> When I use docker for machine learning,I mostly use some python image with jupyter, numpy,scipy, matplotlib.
4 [2017-10-05T07:42:41] <racinmat> but Kaggle image should be good starting point for looking for integration of docker and machine learning [<-LINK->]
5 [2017-10-05T07:46:09] <rkdls> ah that repo is very usefull i think
6 [2017-10-05T07:55:17] <rkdls> but I'm finding project  integrated docker-py and machine-learning
7 [2017-10-05T08:07:03] <rkdls> aha Ok. I just looking for anyproject. thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-05T07:58:36] <racinmat> you mean project in machine learning utilizing docker? I do not think I get your question. In machine learning, people do not care much about docker, it is used only to more easily run the machine learning source code, nothing more.

1 [2017-10-05T19:33:14] <sherryhw> hello everyone. is there anyone who use "dockerfile-maven-plugin"?
2 [2017-10-05T19:34:19] <sherryhw> I use this maven plugin to build and push image to a reposotory. however, on the first step to build the image, it fails for "Caused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.spotify.docker.client.shaded.javax.ws.rs.ProcessingException: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection?" Anyone has any ideas? Thanks!

2 [2017-10-06T11:46:47] <Fuco1> in git we can do something likegit ls-files --others -i --exclude-from=.gitignore | awk -F "/" \'{print $1}\' | sort | uniqto get the toplevel ignored files/directories... I\'m looking for something similar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-06T14:34:25] <brandonawells> Does anyone here do any sort of container security cans on their docker containers? If so, how are you doing, what service(s), how does it integrate with your CI progress, etc..? Any help is appreciated.
2 [2017-10-06T14:34:38] <brandonawells> Part 2 to that, has anyone ever worked with Twistlock?
3 [2017-10-06T15:46:31] <aios> littlefuntik: beacause containers runing in own network

1 [2017-10-07T16:51:26] <JonasHedEng> Hello! Is it possible to have some form of recursive dependency on replicas? I want to start a bunch of replicas of the same image on my docker subnet and when they start they try to register to another replica on a "smaller" IP address.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-09T01:17:15] <ebcodes> question
2 [2017-10-09T01:17:29] <ebcodes> I'm using Synology Diskstation and Docker
3 [2017-10-09T01:17:42] <ebcodes> unfortunately, /var/run/docker.sock only allows access via root
4 [2017-10-09T01:18:24] <ebcodes> 1) is this by design?2) if it isn't, is there a global config somewhere on Synology (maybe /var/packages/Docker/...) where I can ensure this sock file doesn't prohibit access by non-root users?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-09T02:51:25] <SISheogorath> ebcodes: Yes, that's by default the case. Only root and docker users should have access to this socket. Simply because who ever has write access to this socket has root privileges.
2 [2017-10-09T18:36:19] <SISheogorath> mcarpenterjr: I guess what you are searching for is the term "reverse proxy" ;)
3 [2017-10-09T18:39:37] <SISheogorath> MonXBZH: yes, as always. Simply put thedocker swarm joinstatement in your console on your remote worker. But you have to make sure, that your manager is accessible (means routed alias "doesn\'t use a private IP space in a different network").
4 [2017-10-10T02:19:28] <DWSR> MonXBZH: This is highly discouraged as the Docker socket provides root access to the box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-09T08:46:16] <MonXBZH> Hello there ! o/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-10-09T09:11:45] <VQuery> Hi guys ,i just now installed docker for windows and switched to windows containers .Now  i want to create docker-machine ,how to do this ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-09T17:38:34] <mcarpenterjr> Question, I have a docker container running, it has a port exposed at:3030I have apache running on the same server as docker. I would like to configure a relative url to point to:3030. Is this possible? and if so what terminology would I be searching for. I googled a couple different terms and I either get results that describe if apache is running as a container or some other unexpected result.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T03:57:46] <VQuery> i am using jenkinsci/slave image in minimax linux boot2docker ,but our organization has only windows platform build operation like Msbuild compilations ,bat files execute,visual studio supporting tools .How to create windows machine slave in docker ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T04:46:22] <comeUpWithItLater> I  just send an image to the  manager machine in a swarm cluster :
2 [2017-10-10T04:46:35] <comeUpWithItLater>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-10-10T04:47:52] <comeUpWithItLater> do I need to send it to every  worker  worker machine b4 I candocker stack deploy ***?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T08:25:54] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: you should use a private registry for swarm. Since swarm automatically uses the fingerprint of an image to identify it and make sure it's the same image for this service no matter if the tag got overwritten or not. There is no functionality built-in to send your images to the workers
2 [2017-10-10T08:29:52] <MonXBZH> Thx@SISheogorathand@BrandonAndrews
3 [2017-10-10T08:31:42] <comeUpWithItLater> Thank you@SISheogorath
4 [2017-10-10T08:32:03] <comeUpWithItLater> one more:
5 [2017-10-10T08:33:05] <comeUpWithItLater> network_mode: "host"config option is not supported in stack.yml  ?
6 [2017-10-10T08:33:27] <comeUpWithItLater>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T08:38:28] <comeUpWithItLater> if so ,  how to  proxy pass ( nginx )  to an other  stack service's container port?
2 [2017-10-10T09:57:59] <comeUpWithItLater> but  I need to proxy  it  to  container(s)  in an other stack services
3 [2017-10-10T09:59:13] <comeUpWithItLater> i   knewbackendrefer to   an other service name  in the current  stack  in your example
4 [2017-10-10T10:03:31] <comeUpWithItLater> so how to refer to  service  in   other  stack  ?
5 [2017-10-10T10:04:07] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: nope, network_most: "host" currently doesn\'t work in swarm mode so also not in stack deploy. The answer to how to pass the stuff is networking. The recommendation from my side is use an API based reverse proxy like traefik. If you are form "bug I need nginx" fraction, take a look at jwilders dynamic nginx reverse proxy image
6 [2017-10-10T10:04:33] <SISheogorath> when you are inside a stack you can simply use the service name on the stack's network
7 [2017-10-10T10:04:37] <rsoeldner> ^^ ok thanks i will check this too
8 [2017-10-10T10:05:14] <SISheogorath> rsoeldner: Check [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-10-10T12:09:45] <SISheogorath> Yes. Since it's your code (even when it's generated) you can license it as you wish. You only have to make sure that your DEPENDENCIES don't conflict with your license. Check for license compatibility in this case.
10 [2017-10-10T12:12:14] <masaeedu> Thanks
11 [2017-10-10T12:12:54] <SISheogorath> You're welcome.

2 [2017-10-10T09:59:16] <rsoeldner> Hm, I'm not sure if I understand this, I use alinksflag in my docker compose
3 [2017-10-10T10:01:37] <SISheogorath> rsoeldner: you shouldn't.linkshave ugly side effects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T11:35:54] <masaeedu> Probably the least lawyery person on the planet, would appreciate help with a licensing question.
2 [2017-10-10T11:36:29] <masaeedu> If I generate a client for the Docker API using the swagger API definition, can this client be licensed/published under MIT?

13 [2017-10-10T12:36:04] <comeUpWithItLater> could  be some nginx  config  workroud?
14 [2017-10-10T12:38:35] <SISheogorath> maybe, you do a prefix strip there, which is probably not what you want
15 [2017-10-10T12:45:23] <comeUpWithItLater> comment out the- "traefik.frontend.rule=PathPrefixStrip:/http/", still doesn\'t work

1 [2017-10-10T12:31:19] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: try to run traefik with the--weband expose port 8080
2 [2017-10-10T12:31:46] <SISheogorath> then check this webinterface for what rules are applied to what container
3 [2017-10-10T12:32:05] <SISheogorath> also check your traefik settings for the default domain suffix for containers
4 [2017-10-10T12:32:42] <SISheogorath> If you don't want to change the default settings or want to use multiple domains, consider to use ahostrule

1 [2017-10-10T14:07:09] <Aaaaaa11804835_twitter> Hi. What is the best practice to get source code from repository? Using 'git pull' in Dockerfile or first pull repository and then run docker?
2 [2017-10-10T17:23:10] <littlefuntik> девиз "Хочешь с чего-то начать - начни с докера" :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-10T17:29:41] <SISheogorath> Aaaaaa11804835_twitter: depends on your needs. In general I would go for docker inside the repository, when it's a project that runs inside a company. Docker split up into an own repository, then build the image and test the image for software you are about to publish, because you probably need different tests, additional documentation and an own CI process for docker. Besides your usual way of setting the software up natively
2 [2017-10-10T17:30:50] <SISheogorath> So while in the first case for internal projects I would go forCOPY . /srcin the latter version in an own repository you will clone the latest stable release

1 [2017-10-11T08:56:19] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: what I use in production: Create a network for traefik. then rundocker-compose upfor your traefik instance with an network that is marked as external. Everything else, you want to publish on HTTP or HTTPS should use this network as external network

5 [2017-10-11T09:19:05] <SISheogorath> What's the output ofdocker version?
6 [2017-10-11T09:32:10] <SISheogorath> That should be fine. I would recommend to open an issue in [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-10-11T09:33:16] <SISheogorath> When you are sure there is only docker involved, that's the way to go
8 [2017-10-11T09:34:26] <yiv> thanks, I'll do it
9 [2017-10-11T10:34:50] <SISheogorath> crebuh: Usually this happens by not locked dependencies. yarn hasyarn install --pure-lockfileto prevent this. NPM 5 also uses some kind of lock file, maybe you want to check this out

2 [2017-10-11T08:58:59] <SISheogorath> VQuery: I can't say anything about windows containers or jenkins. I touched my last jenkins over a year ago and for windows the time scale is similar
3 [2017-10-11T08:59:49] <SISheogorath> Maybe check the docker Community Slack. There is an entire channel about windows containers
4 [2017-10-11T09:00:02] <SISheogorath> And also one for CI/CD
5 [2017-10-11T09:02:23] <VQuery> SISheogorath:  is  windows container users count very low globally ?
6 [2017-10-11T09:06:45] <SISheogorath> The whole container thing is a bit new to Windows, so I would say there is a large gap between the number of Windows containers and the number of Linux containers. Especially when it comes to the usage in production. But that doesn't mean that the windows containers count is very low. It's not as popular right now, but a fastly growing market

1 [2017-10-11T10:32:05] <crebuh> Hy Guys, had anyobdy a similar issue with a node-application. When I'm building the container locally all dependencies are installed correctly (with the right version). When I build the container on my remote server, a wrong version of the peerDependency is installed. Not sure how this could happen. I then always have to login into the container remove the module and install it with npm installpackage@correct-versionagain. Which is pretty annoying
2 [2017-10-11T14:09:39] <crebuh> SISheogorath: yes I know this, this is the reason why on our projects we are always locking the dependencies by using a fixed version number and now ^ or ~ in front. but it seems that one of the dependencies (let's say express) has also a dependency and this peer-dependency is installed with the wrong version
3 [2017-10-11T14:13:22] <SISheogorath> You useyarnornpm?
4 [2017-10-11T14:14:48] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] <-- is this included in your source repository you add to your container?
5 [2017-10-11T14:17:48] <SISheogorath> I see. Right now, the install from lock is missing in npm right now [<-ISSUE->]
6 [2017-10-11T14:18:09] <SISheogorath> try to useyarnand check if the issue perists

1 [2017-10-11T19:53:50] <johnsonw> Hello, quick question regarding disk creation in docker. In vagrant, we have been able to create a disk by doing something like this: [<-CODE->] I can then see the disk by running lvmdiskscan: [<-CODE->] Is it possible to create a disk like this in a docker container?

1 [2017-10-11T20:22:43] <Scapal> What would be the best pattern to publish docker service?I was thinking about having only the manager nodes with a public IP.Put a pair of haproxy with a failover VIP in front of that.
2 [2017-10-11T20:23:46] <Scapal> Is this considered the best practice or should I just put a failover VIP on the manager nodes without an additional layer of haproxy outside the swarm ?
3 [2017-10-11T20:24:24] <SISheogorath> The regular setup is more that the manager nodes are hidden in a private network and a few worker nodes are exposed
4 [2017-10-11T20:25:01] <SISheogorath> But it highly depends on what you are about to do and how familiar you are with these setups
5 [2017-10-11T20:33:31] <Scapal> My setup is:3 Proxmox servers, on each one: 1 manager node for fault tolerance + worker nodes.I was going to put 3 small VM with HaProxy (with corosync and pacemaker for VIP failover) and load-balancer to the 3 manager nodes with health check.I this setup, even the manager nodes don’t need a public IP.
6 [2017-10-11T20:34:59] <Scapal> The other possibility I can think about is to have the HaProxy on the manager nodes (or 3 other workers) with pacemaker on those 3 swarm nodes to assign the VIP to one of them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-12T06:25:16] <SISheogorath> MonXBZH: for the management traffic thats the default case (iirc there is no way to disable it) to encrypt your overlay network traffic, add the `--encrypt* option during creation
2 [2017-10-12T06:29:13] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: you should have two networks. One for your proxy and one for your API/backend stuff of the service. Both should be overlay networks. The API service should be in both, the database only in the backend network

7 [2017-10-15T12:00:47] <SISheogorath> On any other binary that watches for file changes and restarts the node process or re-require the changed files

12 [2017-10-18T07:09:00] <SISheogorath> Right now docker-compose is not deprecated and as far as I know there are no plans for this. And even when it would be deprecated, if it's deprecated likelinksit's supported for more than a year afterwards
13 [2017-10-18T07:10:30] <SISheogorath> Also keep in mind that there are alternatives that use it as library like Ansible'sdocker_servicemodule, so we don't need to be worried that something will stop working
14 [2017-10-18T08:17:41] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: the build statement says that the image will be build if not exist
15 [2017-10-18T08:18:23] <SISheogorath> The image statement specifies the tagging for the image that is the result of the build process or used in general when it already exists

17 [2017-10-18T09:31:43] <SISheogorath> It breaks the wholecommand:part since it uses"$@"instead of$@and this way pass all arguments that were passed to the script, as one argument to their tool. That again, breaks the whole argument parsing
18 [2017-10-18T09:39:34] <SISheogorath> fix it?

1 [2017-10-18T13:52:21] <BrianAsher> I have a project environment that is setup using docker and docker-compose.  It works great for the dev team.  I am trying to deploy it to AWS ECS using their ecs-cli tool.  AWS has a limit of 10 task definitions, which correlates to 10 containers in docker.  We have more than that because we are using event sourcing and have a container for each projection.  Has anyone ran into this problem? Do you have any suggestions for a way to get around this?

1 [2017-10-19T15:07:12] <matrixbot> YvesI need container A to be up and running to build container B (A is a caching proxy). Must I really need to put that into 2docker-compose.ymlor can I have that properly done in only one, to keep common definitions at the same place (network, for example)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-20T09:29:28] <carlosjgp> matrixbot: You don't have to usedocker-compose. You can run them with justdockerI will recommend to use and external volume (docker volume --help) for the caching in case you want to change the proxy container

1 [2017-10-20T15:25:51] <ndpratas> Hi, this is a quick one (for those more knowledge than me): Is docker stack the only way to deploy services through an yaml file?
2 [2017-10-20T15:26:41] <ndpratas> my understanding was that stack was more for like... well... a stack of individual services and not for ONE service itself
3 [2017-10-20T15:26:56] <ndpratas> say I only want to deploy 1 service (1 container)
4 [2017-10-20T15:27:10] <ndpratas> do I still have to use docker stack?

2 [2017-10-20T20:34:52] <imaia> Hey guys, I'm having trouble with the containers ips
3 [2017-10-20T20:35:06] <imaia> they're conflicting with my network
4 [2017-10-20T20:35:20] <imaia> whenever my container is up, my network goes down
5 [2017-10-20T20:35:48] <imaia> I tried editing daemon.json to mend things (make docker-compose create containers in another network, but it is not working)
6 [2017-10-20T20:35:59] <imaia> did anyone go through that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-20T20:51:22] <dylanscott> not sure if this is a reasonable place to ask this but is there any way with the registry API ( [<-LINK->] ) to retrieve tags for a specific image (identified by digest)?
2 [2017-10-20T20:51:33] <dylanscott> i only see a way to get all tags for a repo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-23T09:24:14] <ndpratas> imaia: Thank you for the link. However I had already checked that and didn't find the answer I was looking for. Fortunately someone over on IRC channel pointed me in the right direction. Turns out stack is the way to go if you want to start services via yaml. I already suspected this, I just wanted someone more knowledge than I am to confirm that. Thank you anyway.
2 [2017-10-23T11:58:30] <ndpratas> QUICK QUESTION: I'm noticing that whenever i start a new stack (only 1 service) each container gets two ips, one that is common to the service (all containers of the same service have it) and 1 unique to each container itself. Is this by design? Where can I read more about this? How can I change this behavior
3 [2017-10-23T11:58:32] <ndpratas> ?

7 [2017-10-23T13:33:44] <ndpratas> you should however keep selinux on, so if it works, then makesudo setenforce 1and read journalctl to see how you can add the exception to selinux

Is there a UI build on top of the bash or something that can integrate with git repository to help building keeping track of version and desired build environment (pointing to a different dockerfile)?

6 [2017-10-24T14:47:34] <akshay951228> ndpratas: If I started the container with some port like 30303 but I didn't expose the port. will I'm able to publish the port in host or not?
7 [2017-10-24T16:42:23] <akshay951228> ndpratas: thanks once again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-24T10:23:40] <ndpratas> @akshay951228 I believe you can just pass a -p ####:#### to publish a new port in run time without the need to expose it...however if you want to buid a new image from that original image you can just do something like: [<-CODE->] Then you can just pass a -P (capital p) to publish on the host every port that is being exposed by the container
2 [2017-10-24T15:45:21] <ndpratas> akshay951228: YES. I'm pretty sure you will as long as you pass the -p (lower capital) ####:####

1 [2017-10-25T01:31:32] <MacroLove> Hi all, I build an image with exist name in my docker, will this new image overwrite the old one?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-25T08:35:22] <ndpratas> @MacroLoveImages in Docker don\'t have a name, they have tags.A tag is a reference to an image. Multiple tags may refer to the same image.If you reassign a tag that is already used, then the original image will lose the tag, but will continue to exist (it will still be accessible by its image ID, and other tags might refer to it). https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26401649/building-a-new-docker-image-with-the-same-name-as-an-existing-onesSo when you do "docker build -t my_image" the image will not be overwritten BUT your tag "my_image" will to the newly created image. So when you do "docker run my_image" your new image will be spun up.
2 [2017-10-25T08:46:50] <ndpratas> aldarund: can you show us your yaml? are you publishing the port in yaml?
3 [2017-10-25T08:55:43] <ndpratas> aldarund: Oh I didn\'t realize the port on SO was yours, sorry. Your yaml is fine I guess. I think (not sure) the problem is you\'re trying to connect to the localhost (127.0.0.1) and not the interface of the host itself. Try doing a "netstat -aon" on windows command line with the container up and see if the 27017 port it listening and at which ip
4 [2017-10-25T08:56:33] <ndpratas> My guess is if you do a "telnet yourhostname 27017" instead of "telnet localhost 27017" it will work
5 [2017-10-25T09:15:53] <ndpratas> aldarund: can you please do a telnet to that port and see if you can indeed connect to it?
6 [2017-10-25T09:16:02] <ndpratas> because if you can, the problem must be something else
7 [2017-10-25T09:19:24] <ndpratas> if it clears it means it connected
8 [2017-10-25T09:20:51] <ndpratas> cat you do "docker exec your_container_running cat /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log" ?
9 [2017-10-25T09:21:30] <ndpratas> can*
10 [2017-10-25T09:22:20] <aldarund> ndpratas: cat: /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log: No such file or directorythe logs are outputted into docker logs .  But there nothing in it. Last record is waiting for connections on port 27017
11 [2017-10-25T09:25:07] <aldarund> even if i set db.setLogLevel(5) there nothing in mongo logs
12 [2017-10-25T09:25:23] <aldarund> *nothing about failed connect attempts.
13 [2017-10-25T10:06:14] <aldarund> I see a difference in docker ps when run via compose vs when run via docker. [<-LINK->] ( 27017/tcp, 0.0.0.0:27017->21017/tcp ) vs [<-LINK->] (0.0.0.0:27017->21017/tcp)I guess that the cause of error. But no idea why this happens.
14 [2017-10-25T12:03:43] <aldarund> and this behavior is exactly same on linux host and its reproducible.
15 [2017-10-25T12:14:39] <aldarund> carlosjgp: its latest version. and i asked my friend on linux try it. And he have same behaviour with his docker and docker-compose

1 [2017-10-25T08:36:12] <aldarund> Hi all. Can someone help me with port sharing on windows for mongodb? Basically the problem is that port sharing works if i use docker run but doesnt work if i use same settings via docker-compose. And it confuse me as hell and i even dont know where to look at anymore.  Here is all details [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-10-25T08:47:37] <aldarund> ndpratas: it is on that post on SO. But here it is too: [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-10-25T08:59:27] <aldarund> ndpratas: my host for docker is localhost e.g. 127.0.0.1 . Other port sharing works fine e.g. nginx, postgresql. It only doesnt work for mongo-db via docker-compose. It works for mongodb via docker. And it works for everything else via docker-compose. netstat show as expected e.g.TCP    0.0.0.0:27017          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       25132
4 [2017-10-25T09:00:20] <aldarund> carlosjgp: yes port mapping. No i dont have any other containers and i tried to map to different host port same result. No error in docker-compose
5 [2017-10-25T09:00:46] <ndpratas> well yeah, if it's 0.0.0.0 it should work on localhost as well as your hostname...
6 [2017-10-25T09:02:08] <aldarund> carlosjgp: because of error when i connect to it [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-10-25T09:02:36] <aldarund> carlosjgp: docker run --name my_mongox6 -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
8 [2017-10-25T09:05:00] <aldarund> but it doesnt throw any errors when i run it via docker without compose. same image. same settings
9 [2017-10-25T09:05:07] <aldarund> connect works fine
10 [2017-10-25T09:18:57] <aldarund> ndpratas: it writes Connecting To localhost... and then clear screen and in command line again and thats it.
11 [2017-10-25T09:19:43] <aldarund> ndpratas: its in windows command line again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-25T08:59:18] <carlosjgp> aldarund: Port sharing? you mean port mapping? Which error reportsdocker-compose? Do you have any other container running with a port mapped to the same port (27017)? as@ndpratassuggested usenetstatto find it out ordocker ps
2 [2017-10-25T09:01:07] <carlosjgp> aldarund: So why do you think/know it's not working ondocker-compose?
3 [2017-10-25T09:01:48] <carlosjgp> Can you post how do you run Mongo withdocker run?
4 [2017-10-25T09:04:11] <carlosjgp> So it's not that you can't connect to Mongo, it's that an error is throw after connecting (sorry I'm not a Mongo user)
5 [2017-10-25T12:13:31] <carlosjgp> aldarund: Could be an error related to the container, or thedocker-composeordockeryou are using.I'll recommend updating both and if it doesn't work raise a GitHub ticket for the Mongo image, I use lots of other containers withdocker runanddocker-composeand they behave in the same wayTry to update your Mongo image toodocker pull mongo:latest
6 [2017-10-25T12:20:09] <carlosjgp> aldarund: So, in my opinion, that container is "broken" try an older version and see how it works
7 [2017-10-25T12:21:57] <LY3DM> i see u need to download latest version of the container
8 [2017-10-25T12:24:29] <aldarund> carlosjgp: oldest version ( 3.0 ) - same behaviour
9 [2017-10-25T12:24:36] <aldarund> LY3DM: it is latest version
10 [2017-10-25T12:30:54] <carlosjgp> aldarund: Maybe this will help? [<-LINK->] I don't think this is a Docker issue. Mongo may need special configuration to run on containers :/
11 [2017-10-25T12:31:38] <aldarund> carlosjgp: doesnt help. and it work if run via docker itself without compose.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-29T12:22:55] <dykyi-roman> how create DB after run mysql container in docker-compose. I can add*.sh script or  *.sql scriptfor run in docker-compose.yaml or I must create new image inherited from base mysql container and write my code inside container
2 [2017-10-29T14:27:29] <dykyi-roman> jimschubert: thanks and if i dont want write Dockerfile and use docker-compose.yml, Did you know docker-compose have command for copy and run sql script like in you github example
3 [2017-10-29T14:29:41] <dykyi-roman> i am done, but script not automatic run
4 [2017-10-29T14:30:11] <dykyi-roman> volumes: [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-10-29T14:30:25] <dykyi-roman> data -> mysql.sql
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-29T14:14:15] <jimschubert> dykyi-roman: you'd have to add scripts into a derived Dockerfile.  For an example check out [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-10-29T14:18:21] <jimschubert> The database environment variable ensures the DB is created. That and the user/pass could be moved to docker-compose.yaml. You could forgo the custom file by mapping a local volume with structured scripts to the appropriate location in the container. Just remember that scripts execute in bash glob order, which is alph
3 [2017-10-29T14:18:47] <jimschubert> ... ascending. so I like to prefix with numbers.
4 [2017-10-29T14:28:13] <jimschubert> d
5 [2017-10-29T14:29:11] <jimschubert> dykyi-roman: you can use the volume command and mount your scripts to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
6 [2017-10-29T14:32:46] <jimschubert> Hm. Check your .dockerignore to make sure "data" isn\'t ignored. You can exec into the container and inspect the directory (easiest via Kitematic).
7 [2017-10-29T14:34:13] <jimschubert> Also, you may want to check the base image you're using to make sure the directory is correct. my base, I think it's 5.7.
8 [2017-10-29T14:36:18] <jimschubert> I just verified the 8.0 image is the same location.
9 [2017-10-29T14:37:02] <dykyi-roman> i am not have dockerignore file
10 [2017-10-29T14:37:25] <dykyi-roman> i am check file is copy and exist in the folder
11 [2017-10-29T14:37:38] <dykyi-roman> strange (
12 [2017-10-29T14:38:04] <jimschubert> Maybe kill that container and recreate it?
13 [2017-10-29T14:39:25] <dykyi-roman> ok i try
14 [2017-10-29T14:39:46] <jimschubert> I used that method from a compose file almost a year ago, but my team moved to using flywaydb and running different scripts per  "environment"
15 [2017-10-29T14:40:22] <dykyi-roman> understand)
16 [2017-10-29T14:42:10] <jimschubert> docker logs should show echo statements when it attempts to run your script. Good luck, I hope I helped a bit. ;)
17 [2017-10-29T14:46:13] <dykyi-roman> jimschubert: yes thanks
18 [2017-10-29T14:46:42] <dykyi-roman> logs is clear. Not found information about start run my script
19 [2017-10-29T15:45:20] <dykyi-roman> jimschubert: kill all container ad images and run again - and work)))) fuck
20 [2017-10-29T15:45:50] <dykyi-roman> cash ?
21 [2017-10-29T15:48:18] <jimschubert> probably. docker-compose doesn't rebuild by default. I think there's a --recreate option or something. If you kill the running container via Kitematic, it'll often resolve issues. I created a startup script for my composed network that traps EXIT and tears down the created network. That seems to work pretty nicely for my team.
22 [2017-10-30T08:50:27] <dykyi-roman> jimschubert: ok thnaks
23 [2017-10-30T08:53:08] <dykyi-roman> somebody works with nginx-proxy? now i have one site him work on the nging, How I can add multi-website config to my docker-compose.yml

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-30T19:10:19] <rightisleft> Is docker's TLS support only for the docker engine, or is it designed to also be utilized by app-land code ?
2 [2017-10-30T19:11:43] <rightisleft> IE: If i have 2 containers in my swarm, can i access the certs from docker to verify identities?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-10-30T21:16:52] <SISheogorath> rightisleft: no, you can't access the certificates from docker. But you can use encrypted networking in swarm to make sure it's nothing weird around
2 [2017-10-31T11:15:24] <SISheogorath> can you provide the command you used?
3 [2017-10-31T11:33:02] <SISheogorath> papaiatis: you don't. the unit tests should run outside of docker build and show if you application is broken or not. Testing during a docker build isn't very useful
4 [2017-10-31T11:51:48] <SISheogorath> You should either have a base image and run the unit tests usingdocker runor you should run them in general outside of docker. I would recommend running them usingdocker runduring your CI process
5 [2017-10-31T11:58:49] <papaiatis> thank you
6 [2017-10-31T12:00:55] <papaiatis> ... and if I use your suggestion then I can attach a volume to the container where the report is generated, which I can access outside of the container
7 [2017-10-31T12:25:13] <SISheogorath> exactly
8 [2017-10-31T12:27:06] <SISheogorath> I currently use a 3 image setup for these things. A base image with the production dependencies, A dev image which includes all build and testing tools and the production image which uses multi-staged builds and the dev image to build the production setup based on the base image
9 [2017-10-31T12:35:11] <papaiatis> that sounds complicated
10 [2017-10-31T12:40:35] <SISheogorath> depending on what you are doing it's needed

1 [2017-10-31T11:20:02] <papaiatis> Hi guys. Duringdocker buildI'm creating an image that runs an Angular application.  During the build process, I run the unit tests as well which creates a report (XML file) inside the container. How can I extract this file afterdocker buildfinishes?
2 [2017-10-31T11:50:15] <papaiatis> SISheogorath: Yeah, I didn\'t feel right at the first place. So what do you mean by "run outside" ?

1 [2017-11-01T10:26:24] <jdelStrother> docker-compose appears to use a different build cache that just regulardocker build.  Is that expected?  I'm struggling to find much about it on google
2 [2017-11-01T10:27:54] <jdelStrother> It's partly irritating due to building things twice, but also I was surprised thatdocker build; docker-compose updidn't boot up the newly built image, but instead booted the version thatdocker-compose up --buildlast built
3 [2017-11-01T11:16:41] <jdelStrother> hm. [<-ISSUE->]
4 [2017-11-01T11:28:30] <jdelStrother> Yeah, it's not that.  Here's the start of my Dockerfile - [<-LINK->] .    If I rundocker buildthendocker-compose up --build, it goes through the whole apt-get process twice
5 [2017-11-01T11:40:52] <jdelStrother> carlosjgp: I don't think that's the way docker caching works.   It assumes that the results of a given command are idempotent, it doesn't know anything about whether packages may have changed.
6 [2017-11-01T11:41:24] <jdelStrother> Otherwisedocker build && docker buildwould run apt-get twice, but instead the second version uses the cache from the first
7 [2017-11-01T11:54:53] <jdelStrother> thanks, I'll take a look
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-01T11:15:00] <carlosjgp> jdelStrother: it shouldn't since, as far as I know,docker-composeis a python library that comunicates with your docker client (see [<-LINK->] )
2 [2017-11-01T11:19:45] <carlosjgp> They are using a really old version of docker and docker-compose. And bear in mind that there are commands that can't be cached likeCOPYorADD [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-11-01T11:39:03] <carlosjgp> jdelStrother: but that makes sense (for me)... the packages may have changed. If you want to cache theapt-get installcommand I will suggest you to build your own ubuntu\\debian base image and then install ruby in another image
4 [2017-11-01T11:43:58] <carlosjgp> You are right... docker cache looks only to theRUNcommand string... I will suggest to investigate a little bit more aboutdocker-composeand the--no-cache. You can rundocker-compose --verboseto see which commands are been sent to your docker client
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-01T17:40:14] <rightisleft> when you are defining ports in docker-compose - its usually host:container - whtat does it mean when it just a single value?
2 [2017-11-01T17:42:33] <rightisleft> is that just the container port - but not exposed to the host?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-02T06:55:23] <SISheogorath> rightisleft: only the port will expose the port to a random port on the host
2 [2017-11-02T06:55:43] <SISheogorath> przemolb: docker-compose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-02T11:13:21] <SISheogorath> It doesn\'t check for updates this way.latestis simply the default tag. if you want to "update" the online version you have to tag your container as 1.1 and latest and push both
2 [2017-11-02T11:14:22] <SISheogorath> then you can pull them. But the docker daemon itself won't pull a newer image if an image with the defined name is already in the local image store

1 [2017-11-02T15:28:19] <ImFlog> Hi all, do you know if it is possible to bind a --config to an env var in docker swarm ?
2 [2017-11-02T15:29:04] <ImFlog> The doc statesConfigs can be added or removed from a service at any time, and services can share a config. You can even use configs in conjunction with environment variables or labels, for maximum flexibility.
3 [2017-11-02T15:30:08] <ImFlog> But I did not found any information about how to do this. Thank you in advance.
4 [2017-11-02T15:30:36] <ndpratas> ImFlog: What do you mean by "bind a --config to an env var"?
5 [2017-11-02T15:31:24] <ImFlog> I would like to put my config content in a env var like--config source=my-config,env=MY_ENV
6 [2017-11-02T15:37:15] <ImFlog> I understand that it is not acceptable for secrets for security reasons but don't understand for config...
7 [2017-11-02T15:37:33] <ImFlog> any idea about this@ndpratas?
8 [2017-11-02T15:39:16] <ndpratas> @ImFlog I actually never used config. I was just reading into it. Maybe I'm not the best person to help you. Nonetheless, when you sayput my config content in a env var likeDo you mean an env var of the HOST machine or the container?
9 [2017-11-02T15:59:05] <ImFlog> Container
10 [2017-11-02T17:26:11] <ImFlog> Well the use case is not about sensitive information, this is just a common configuration and I found it easier to use config than secret (the interesting part for us was environment vars)
11 [2017-11-02T17:28:32] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: There is exactly one valid solution: Make your image aware of the possibility that a service is not there and it has to wait for it's depedency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-11-05T14:55:26] <siassaj> I've been copying compiled assets and dependencies into my docker builds via ADD, doing my app's build tasks (which may create, reuse and delete some assets/dependencies) and after the image is create I copy those compiled assets and dependencies into a cache using docker cp.It speeds up builds significantly, but it makes it hard to use things like aws' ECS or any other docker build & deploy service because of the need for a custom bash script.
2 [2017-11-05T14:56:23] <siassaj> when I builththis there was no better way that seemed to exist. Have there been any changes to improve this, and get all thes 'caching' steps into the Dockerfile

1 [2017-11-07T09:02:40] <pjetr> Hey guys, I've a question, that I posted on reddit as well: [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-11-07T09:04:38] <pjetr> in short I need to create a staging system, and need to be able to build each branch, and test each branch manually of every application in our eco-system. IE test a specific ticket of application A against the master of application B, development of application C and perhaps even another ticket of app D...
3 [2017-11-07T09:05:17] <pjetr> My idea is to create docker containers in our CI of each branch, and simply choose which container to run
4 [2017-11-07T09:06:04] <pjetr> but this would require my containers to contain more than one technology, ie nginx + php-fpm + mariadb + redis + elastic
5 [2017-11-07T09:06:22] <pjetr> or node + redis + mongo
6 [2017-11-07T09:06:30] <pjetr> or ...
7 [2017-11-07T09:07:09] <pjetr> The reason why I would try to keep it all in a single container is to make switching between branches as smooth as possible
8 [2017-11-07T09:07:40] <pjetr> and, more importantly, to have migrations ran during build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-07T18:51:07] <zcregan> I have a quick question. In my dockerfile, how do I COPY a directory and a file to WORKDIR in a single layer? I currently have this:COPY src/ tsconfig.json ./but that copies the contents of src, not the src directory itself.

1 [2017-11-07T20:12:57] <djfusco> I'm looking to run a script of SQL commands against my mariadb AFTER it has been brought up and started.  the script can be run from the same container or another - it doesn't matter.  I've tried this, but it tells me mysql isn't ready yet.

11 [2017-11-07T20:55:11] <djfusco> might be a permission issue - looking at that now
12 [2017-11-07T20:56:16] <pjetr> you can simply use ENV stuff to do that@djfusco
13 [2017-11-07T20:59:20] <djfusco> pjetr: thanks.  I'm learning.  I appreciate your help
14 [2017-11-07T21:00:23] <pjetr> no worries, I'm no devops myself, but I did that using docker-compose, which made getting a development environment quite easy to set up

1 [2017-11-08T17:50:58] <bitsofinfo> with the announcement of k8 orchestration support and that docker stack compose files can be used when targeting deployment on k8 as the backend, how will the secret functionality of the compose format be handled/translated for k8? Will that be supported?
2 [2017-11-08T18:52:02] <bitsofinfo> We are developing some new containers and would like to pick the best approach for CLI deployment and management policies that will be compatible w/ the future Docker orchestration direction (i.e. k8 or swarm). From this video ( [<-LINK->] ) it sounded like we should just go w/ using compose files and docker stack deploy… then if I understand correctly we could swap out orchestration targets (k8/swarm) with little effort
3 [2017-11-08T18:52:32] <bitsofinfo> So… if I am correct… will this abstraction pertain to secrets as well?

I'm sure it's obviously something with the 'container root' account not having access to the files I've copied over OR the volume I've mapped.  Do I change permissions to the files locally (my Mac) OR change them inside the container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-09T00:56:09] <airtonix> djfusco: things to check for: line endings (should be LF not CRLF), is it executable (chmod +x), does it have#!/bin/THE-ENGINE-YOU-WANT?
2 [2017-11-09T00:58:11] <airtonix> djfusco: also, an example of what you're trying to do is helpfule, beacuse your case is fairly vague and generic. so make a gist, show a directory listing of the project on the host, the docker-compose file (if any), the dockerfile, theentrypoint.shfile (if any)
3 [2017-11-09T00:58:17] <djfusco> the command I\'m using is \'chmod +x somescript.sh\' and what I get is "changing permissions" "Operation not permitted"
4 [2017-11-09T00:59:06] <djfusco> BUT - when I chmod BEFORE I run docker-compose (e.g. chmod 777) it works.  I know I can't just open it to the world,

9 [2017-11-09T01:08:37] <airtonix> djfusco: do you get the same problem if you based your dockerfile on an alpine based image?
10 [2017-11-09T01:09:11] <djfusco> yes it's ubuntu.  not sure if this version has selinux on it
11 [2017-11-09T01:09:56] <djfusco> haven't tried alpine yet, but will try full version of Ubuntu
12 [2017-11-09T01:12:04] <airtonix> does phusion do some funky stuff with users in the container?
13 [2017-11-09T01:12:31] <djfusco> good question.  I do not know.  I was trying to use a smaller version of Ubuntu
14 [2017-11-09T01:13:00] <airtonix> if you want smaller, then i'd use alpine. but then it looks like you're heavily locked into ubuntu with your provisioning
15 [2017-11-09T01:13:40] <djfusco> Yeah, all of my scripts from this full blown server version is wrapped around apt-get vs apk (which I could change if I had to)
16 [2017-11-09T01:13:51] <airtonix> things i'd do at this point: try a generic ubuntu base image with just the entrypoint and the provisioning script. does your chmod work there?
17 [2017-11-09T01:14:15] <airtonix> no docker-compose, no project source code...

1 [2017-11-10T19:08:49] <btamayo> SachinKSingh28: Did you figure out a solution for this? We actually did run to this and I’m not sure what the team’s solution was other than to not use the splunk driver since the container (at least with compose) will fail to instantiate if the logging driver doesn’t work. We’re just going to log to a different level (not directly docker driver) and then forward to splunk. For mine, I moved them to application level. I think others moved it to syslog level.

3 [2017-11-13T17:27:23] <AshokRajuDevops> and it showing WARNING: No swap limit support
4 [2017-11-13T17:27:52] <AshokRajuDevops> i want to create a container with swap mem limit
5 [2017-11-13T17:30:02] <AshokRajuDevops> i updated GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX with cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1 and ran update-grub
6 [2017-11-13T17:30:08] <AshokRajuDevops> but no luck
7 [2017-11-13T17:30:15] <AshokRajuDevops> still i am getting same warning
8 [2017-11-13T17:30:23] <AshokRajuDevops> any idea??

1 [2017-11-13T22:47:18] <JosephLeon> I'm struggling with something that seems very simple but nothing is working. I have a symfony project on docker and I want to hook up sequel pro to the mysql db running in docker
2 [2017-11-13T22:47:25] <JosephLeon>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-11-13T22:47:30] <JosephLeon> that's what im getting
4 [2017-11-13T22:47:54] <JosephLeon> everything I've googled assumes you know what you are doing with docker and im a nub at it
5 [2017-11-13T22:54:43] <JosephLeon> airtonix: so the issue is I suck so bad I dont even know what files you are talking about
6 [2017-11-13T22:55:20] <JosephLeon> I dont do docker, I just got a project dropped in my lap with docker
7 [2017-11-13T22:55:37] <JosephLeon> like getting thrown in water without knowing how to swim
8 [2017-11-13T22:56:12] <JosephLeon> its an OS project [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-11-13T22:56:43] <JosephLeon> Yea I know kind of what docker does
10 [2017-11-13T22:57:22] <JosephLeon> but having to say fetch data from somewhere to hookup to sequel pro im lost, ive poured through file after file and cannot make sense of anything
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-13T22:48:33] <airtonix> JosephLeon: gist all your files. then someone can start giving you a realistic idea about where you can change thigns
2 [2017-11-13T22:56:17] <airtonix> JosephLeon: ahh, but you have some idea that Docker is involed?
3 [2017-11-13T22:58:28] <airtonix> i like how they use the word "easily" then proceed to make you run anything other thandocker-compose upordocker run ...
4 [2017-11-13T22:58:38] <airtonix> looks fun!
5 [2017-11-13T22:58:39] <JosephLeon> hhaha
6 [2017-11-13T23:00:32] <airtonix> I'd start with any chat/forum channel that project has.

1 [2017-11-13T23:03:00] <thedrint> Hi, can't mount named volume correctly. Any ideas? [<-CODE->] After run container, /var/www/html permissions from it copied to my host directory ~/test/app (which bind to myvol early).So, php can't create new files in myvol. And me from host can't create in /home/user/test/app too:(
2 [2017-11-13T23:06:51] <thedrint> But if i map host dir to container: [<-CODE->] I have correct permissions inside and outside: [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-11-13T23:09:14] <thedrint> Maybe I forgot some bind options or something else?Stuck on this:)

1 [2017-11-14T13:24:58] <lanwin> Hi. Does Docker has any way to set default constraints in swarm mode?
2 [2017-11-14T13:26:07] <lanwin> I want to exclude some nodes for special purposes and want to ensure that that nobody deploys to them simply cause he forgot to provide that constraint

1 [2017-11-15T18:48:54] <fouadroumieh> What is the best practice when it come to handling images for dev, staging and prod environments?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-15T22:19:05] <SISheogorath> build a dev image, later build the staging image. Instead of building a prod image, relabel the staging image since it's proven to work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-15T22:48:46] <rightisleft> is there a field in docker-compose to limit the number of service replicas on the same host?
2 [2017-11-15T22:48:58] <rightisleft> IE if i only wantfooto run 1 instance per host - so a host can never have foo.1 foo.2

2 [2017-11-16T08:27:49] <ppLorins> Hey guys, I run the example from the official site, but the http request will cost me more than 20+ seconds , have no idea why , who ever encounter this ?
3 [2017-11-16T08:29:09] <elcolie> ppLorins: Do you usedocker-compose?
4 [2017-11-16T08:29:16] <ppLorins> Yes
5 [2017-11-16T08:29:38] <elcolie> Then please show me in here. If somebody is free they would troubleshoot for you.
6 [2017-11-16T08:29:59] <elcolie> docker-composehas many version. Single wrong indent would get you hair off
7 [2017-11-16T08:30:55] <ppLorins> `version: "3"services:  web: [<-CODE->] networks:  webnet:`this is my docker-compose yml file , it\'s very simple .
8 [2017-11-16T08:31:15] <ppLorins> copy from office site and modify the image to my own one.
9 [2017-11-16T08:32:27] <ppLorins> expose port 7000 on my host machine, and the port 7000 can be telnet okay from outside. Buy the http request will take very long to complete.
10 [2017-11-16T08:36:26] <ppLorins> I believe it's because the app logic inside the container, it's a flask instance and do connect to redis which is not  present actually.
11 [2017-11-16T09:19:00] <elcolie> Yes

2 [2017-11-16T13:33:07] <grofit> as I am losing the will to live trying to extract a gzip file using nanoserver and almost every avenue ends in failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T08:20:29] <jemliF> hi
2 [2017-11-17T08:22:07] <jemliF> I have aDockerfilein which I was trying to run.binfile (a server installer)
3 [2017-11-17T08:24:53] <jemliF> it runs as expected, but it looks like it doesn't respond when it displayPRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE
4 [2017-11-17T08:25:34] <jemliF> I pressENTERbut it behaves like I didn't
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T09:40:35] <SISheogorath> jemliF: because in docker during the build processeverythinghas to run unattended
2 [2017-11-17T09:40:46] <SISheogorath> means without human interaction
3 [2017-11-17T09:41:15] <SISheogorath> so there is no stdin which results in the behaviour you noticed
4 [2017-11-17T14:26:49] <SISheogorath> jemliF: As mentioned before, you can't. If it's your setup script/binary provide a way to pass all needed options by arguments or a config file. If it's not yours, write a wrapper
5 [2017-11-17T14:45:31] <SISheogorath> sounds like Windows
6 [2017-11-17T14:46:58] <SISheogorath> grofit: Since docker usually uses/bin/shalmost everything you can do with/bin/shis also possible inRUN
7 [2017-11-17T18:51:17] <SISheogorath> grofit: well, then you have to check the whole powershell things
8 [2017-11-17T20:06:36] <SISheogorath> fouadroumieh: think about what happens when your application gets too much load and you need a second instance of it
9 [2017-11-17T20:06:51] <SISheogorath> do you want a second DB? Usually not
10 [2017-11-17T20:07:15] <SISheogorath> grofit: On Windows I'm not sure, but on Linux it simply sets the encironment and runs the command
11 [2017-11-17T20:07:33] <SISheogorath> you can see this when you usedocker historyon an image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T09:44:04] <sureshpareek> i do not understand where docker will data stored  if i use gitlab docker in system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T13:03:22] <davidkarlsen> in compose, is there any way do initialize a data volume with contents from the host filesystem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T14:05:15] <grofit> Is there any definitive article about how to do string interpolation in a dockerfile? i.e if I set: [<-CODE->] Then somewhere else I want to do something like [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-11-17T14:05:56] <grofit> as it seems you CAN do interpolation in certain places but some things just use$varnameothers use${varname}and there is little info online about this, which I thought would be a super common use case
3 [2017-11-17T15:08:43] <grofit> AH but here is the kicker
4 [2017-11-17T15:08:45] <grofit> I am in windows
5 [2017-11-17T15:08:49] <grofit> using windows containers
6 [2017-11-17T15:09:05] <grofit> just raised a SO on the subject
7 [2017-11-17T15:09:11] <grofit>  [<-LINK->]
8 [2017-11-17T15:10:12] <grofit> I assumed behaviour would just be the same between both platforms but I assume (like with most things) linux command lines are a lot more intelligent and flexible than windows ones
9 [2017-11-17T18:57:59] <grofit> Ah right one mo as this may be the crux of my issue
10 [2017-11-17T18:59:08] <grofit> My understanding was that the docker file kinda pre processed the RUN and other commands in there, but are you saying that it just passes the content through to ps/cmd without processing it in any way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-17T14:25:43] <jemliF> SISheogorath: How can interact with server installation process, it needs my confirmation for some options
2 [2017-11-17T14:43:43] <jemliF> SISheogorath: maybe it provides--silentinstallation option
3 [2017-11-17T14:44:05] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I will check
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 [2017-11-17T20:18:38] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Basically, if someone says my ip was rate limited which ip will that be?
3 [2017-11-17T20:19:18] <tomiwaadey_twitter> If i run nslookup domain.com i get an ip address
4 [2017-11-17T20:19:48] <tomiwaadey_twitter> if i docker inspect product container for the app, I get another ip address
5 [2017-11-17T20:20:12] <tomiwaadey_twitter> and the host server (digital ocean droplet) is another address.
6 [2017-11-17T20:20:36] <tomiwaadey_twitter> I know it's a newb question, but which ip is what?
7 [2017-11-17T20:21:00] <tomiwaadey_twitter> If i want to change the ip that was rate limited. Which one would be changed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-20T15:25:37] <iosven>  [<-CODE->] Background: I just had a Kafka container of size 80GB where this huge size increase was apparently due to log statements (the actual Kafka data is mapped to a volume so resides outside of the container), and I want to find out if this is Docker default behavior, or if I need to look for a logging configuration that also persists log statements to a file instead of just logging to console.Also, is there a way to cutoff or otherwise configure Docker container logs?
2 [2017-11-20T15:33:51] <iosven> We did not configure anything, so our containers use logging driver json-file with default settings, which would come without constraints regarding size or number of files?

1 [2017-11-22T07:24:55] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Guys, what's the easiest way to deploy docker?
2 [2017-11-22T07:50:57] <tomiwaadey_twitter> In production?
3 [2017-11-22T08:10:37] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Basically, I want to deploy a mini app that scrapes the web for backlink data.
4 [2017-11-22T08:15:08] <tomiwaadey_twitter> I'll need the flexibility to spin up another version of the app with a different ip quickly in case the previous one is rate limited.
5 [2017-11-22T08:15:21] <tomiwaadey_twitter> So I was wondering if anyone know the best solution for this use case with docker.
6 [2017-11-22T08:18:34] <airtonix> It's not
7 [2017-11-22T08:18:55] <airtonix> Your containers will all have the same wan ip address
8 [2017-11-22T08:20:17] <airtonix> Your solution is going to be more complicated thanrun container > so magic from New ip
9 [2017-11-22T08:22:07] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Thanks  Zenobius. I just learnt something new. So the wan ip address will be the host ip address?
10 [2017-11-22T08:22:14] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Interesting.
11 [2017-11-22T08:22:42] <tomiwaadey_twitter> And each container has a different ip address right. What's the term for the container ip address?
12 [2017-11-22T08:23:38] <airtonix> Yes it will, but they'll be lan IP addresses. You could do something with docker events and Amazon Elastic ip if it had an api
13 [2017-11-22T08:27:33] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Interesting! I'll look up these terms to learn more about them. Thanks :)
14 [2017-11-22T08:27:59] <tomiwaadey_twitter> How does docker events and Amazon Elastic ip solve this?
15 [2017-11-22T08:33:12] <tomiwaadey_twitter> Also is there a way to quickly look up both the lan and wan ip adresses from the command line?
16 [2017-11-22T08:56:09] <airtonix> docker inspect
17 [2017-11-22T08:56:57] <airtonix> Your wan IP address isn't handled by docker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-22T07:42:42] <airtonix> Use an os with it preinstalled. Or use docker machine

1 [2017-11-23T08:19:23] <fouadroumieh> Is it possible to install Docker for windows through the command in docker-compose file? also Hyper-V?
2 [2017-11-23T09:26:44] <airtonix> Docker machine works in powershell.
3 [2017-11-23T09:27:43] <airtonix> Like... We all know Microsoft is about software as layers of Band-Aids... Bash on on Ubuntu on Windows... Just ugh.
4 [2017-11-23T09:29:58] <airtonix> What does your volume directive actually look like?
5 [2017-11-23T09:31:02] <airtonix> Depends on which shell.
6 [2017-11-23T09:32:08] <airtonix> But with docker machine all your mounts are going to be in the Virtual machine... This isn't docker-for-windows and moby
7 [2017-11-23T09:32:46] <airtonix> There is no windows workstation:docker host sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-23T08:42:31] <kunalbhatia87> Hello, Is there a way to create docker-machines on "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows", looking to create multiple hosts as done using hyperv driver in windows
2 [2017-11-23T09:29:31] <kunalbhatia87> airtonix: I agree on that, but the reason I\'m using the WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) to solve other issues of mounting volumes like"Err": "invalid mount config for type \\"bind\\": bind source path does not exist"
3 [2017-11-23T09:30:35] <kunalbhatia87> when using docker-machines on windows shell, it is unable to find the  source path for bind type.
4 [2017-11-23T09:31:34] <kunalbhatia87>  [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-11-23T09:33:47] <kunalbhatia87> the code run with docker-compose as it natively uses the shared drives as configured in docker settings.
6 [2017-11-23T09:34:14] <airtonix> In docker for Windows?
7 [2017-11-23T09:34:50] <kunalbhatia87> Yes
8 [2017-11-23T09:36:42] <kunalbhatia87> but fails to run in docker-machine, as the file is not present in the VM
9 [2017-11-23T09:38:18] <airtonix> yeah like I said. docker for windows creates a mobylinux docker server in the hyperv hypervisor
10 [2017-11-23T09:39:08] <airtonix> docker-machine also creates a virtual machine that is a docker host. but you don't get to share the hypervisor host drives into the virtualmachine
11 [2017-11-23T09:40:04] <airtonix> so in your docker-machine virtual machine, there is no path/c/Users/Prometheus
12 [2017-11-23T09:53:28] <kunalbhatia87> yes, there is no path as/c/Users/Prometheus
13 [2017-11-23T09:54:57] <kunalbhatia87>  [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-11-23T09:55:25] <kunalbhatia87> this works on WSL, but not sure if I do the same in docker-machine, it will work or not..

1 [2017-11-23T22:19:16] <rzhovnirchyk> what is a better option for a simple PHP/nginx application?1) mount source code as a volume in compose; use git for deployment (push to git repo, pull on server and run compose up)2) copy source code to images; push images to registry, run images from the registry on server

1 [2017-11-23T22:47:50] <Sankarshan-Mudkavi> Is there a docker for Mac release planned to address the high Sierra crashes? I didn't find much in the repo discussion

1 [2017-11-24T07:29:15] <fouadroumieh> When the Hyper-v is needed for docker? for example is it needed when running windows containers on a windows machine?
2 [2017-11-24T07:34:22] <fouadroumieh> acepsaepudin: that doesn't answer my question. Is it required to be running for win containers?
3 [2017-11-24T07:35:02] <acepsaepudin> yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-11-27T17:05:02] <outkaj> if i declare two volumes for two separate containers in docker-compose which have different names, but the same filepath, is the containers' data stored separately or is it shared? i'd like the former use case (separate data) but with the convenience of not having to specify a different filepath for each container. I am happy to clarify if my explanation is unclear
2 [2017-11-27T17:27:40] <outkaj> update: looks like i can do this (data will be stored separately as long as the names are different, even if filepath the same). thanks!

20 [2017-11-27T20:18:28] <denel-manilov> Do you want to build an image based on the code that is in the repository?

24 [2017-11-27T20:37:13] <leviyehonatan> wow

26 [2017-11-27T20:37:21] <leviyehonatan> ?
27 [2017-11-27T20:37:41] <leviyehonatan> what does your wow refer to
28 [2017-11-27T20:44:27] <denel-manilov> an image is usually contains a specific version of the application
29 [2017-11-27T20:44:58] <leviyehonatan> yes, i know but what if you want to update
30 [2017-11-27T20:45:38] <leviyehonatan> for dev its very helpful
31 [2017-11-27T20:46:16] <leviyehonatan> and i have another question, how is docker is intended to use for deployment?
32 [2017-11-27T20:46:41] <leviyehonatan> how do i get amazon to run my dockerfile/image?
33 [2017-11-27T20:51:55] <denel-manilov> For dev use volumes, to see instantly the code change
34 [2017-11-27T21:00:31] <denel-manilov> The deployment of applications depends on the infrastructure and the instrument of orchestration
35 [2017-11-27T21:00:58] <leviyehonatan> volumes? is that docker?
36 [2017-11-27T21:01:35] <leviyehonatan> infrastructure? could that be amazon ec2 in my case?
37 [2017-11-27T21:03:35] <leviyehonatan> can you give an example?

39 [2017-11-27T21:05:13] <leviyehonatan> i understand, but where does volumes come in handy in my case?

41 [2017-11-27T21:09:38] <leviyehonatan> that

1 [2017-11-27T18:44:44] <leviyehonatan> i'm trying to get some environment variables to the running docker so i can use it in scripts. i thought that ENV will do the trick but apparently it doesnt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-27T19:08:24] <leviyehonatan> environment variables anyone?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-27T19:53:39] <leviyehonatan> i have a container which must accept git commits over ssh, i am not sure yet if this is the best practice or way
2 [2017-11-27T19:53:46] <leviyehonatan> its a machine to receive code, build and deploy it
3 [2017-11-27T19:55:05] <leviyehonatan> and i now see in the dockerized sshd example they say that the env commands wikl be discarded because the way the sshd is run(using CMD)
4 [2017-11-27T19:58:09] <leviyehonatan> so@denel-manilovi guess i can do the echo "export VAR=X" >> /etc/profile trick
5 [2017-11-27T19:58:32] <leviyehonatan> but then i repeat some lines in my Dockerfile since i need them for the build process as well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-27T21:16:16] <denel-manilov> for example, you are developing a site on the PHP so as not to build an image for each code change you mount the volume with the directory of your code inside the container
2 [2017-11-27T21:18:41] <leviyehonatan> so you can change the code outside the container?
3 [2017-11-27T21:19:08] <leviyehonatan> thats useful but what i am trying to do is to be able to push code to update a remote server
4 [2017-11-27T21:19:15] <leviyehonatan> no need for volumes for that
5 [2017-11-27T21:19:32] <leviyehonatan> is docker meant to be used in production this way at all?
6 [2017-11-27T21:19:46] <leviyehonatan> i am sort of using docker as a configuration tool, aren't everybody?
7 [2017-11-27T21:21:52] <leviyehonatan> while we are at it. how would you go about getting a git clone to happen once server starts? would you do it in the build? or after? how do i instruct something to be called on startup
8 [2017-11-27T21:25:30] <denel-manilov> I can not respond so quickly from the mobile version Gitter)

11 [2017-11-27T21:29:44] <denel-manilov> I will try to show the simplest example of a working process with Docker.
12 [2017-11-27T21:31:59] <denel-manilov> local dev - git push - ci/cd build image and push to registry and update service
13 [2017-11-27T21:32:04] <denel-manilov> Done)
14 [2017-11-27T21:32:37] <leviyehonatan> update service?
15 [2017-11-27T21:34:06] <denel-manilov> Yes, remove old and run new
16 [2017-11-27T21:34:17] <leviyehonatan> how is that done?
17 [2017-11-27T21:34:23] <leviyehonatan> on amazon for example
18 [2017-11-27T21:50:37] <leviyehonatan> if i used amazon?
19 [2017-11-27T21:50:52] <leviyehonatan> i must run my production server on some remote server

3 [2017-11-29T10:16:51] <jemliF> It works good excepting that in the next instructionRUN npm -v
4 [2017-11-29T10:17:06] <jemliF> I gotnpm undefined
5 [2017-11-29T10:17:57] <jemliF> when I dive into the built container andnpm -vI get 6.10.2
6 [2017-11-29T10:19:00] <jemliF> its like it installs node but when running npm just after the installation in the Dockerfile it returnsundefined
7 [2017-11-29T10:20:05] <jemliF> Who knows a solution? my goal is to install node version6.10.2and npm version4.1.2after all
8 [2017-11-29T11:17:49] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I need to install a specific version of node
9 [2017-11-29T12:42:13] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I don't need the image, I need to install node in a Dockerfile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-29T11:01:16] <SISheogorath> why do you run nvm inside a docker container? O.o
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-29T11:22:14] <SISheogorath> Isn't that version available on docker hub?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-29T14:55:30] <sudorobot> basic question, I’m new: I have pulled an image from docker hub, how do I turn this image into a working directory? How do I edit the files and work with them? I can’t even find them
2 [2017-11-29T15:07:53] <sudorobot> I see, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-11-29T15:06:58] <SISheogorath> sudorobot: That's not how docker works. Docker is not git. In docker you download an image which is ready to use. Sometimes you need to use a bindmount to add or edit some config files, but the better way is to either extend an image if you need to add configs or make it configurable by environment variables

4 [2017-11-30T21:03:12] <Cosbgn> I'm trying to connect to a local postgresql database, but I'm having troubles since docker obviously can't find it as it's not in the container
5 [2017-11-30T21:04:28] <Cosbgn> 2nd I also have troubles figuring out the.envfiles, should I just through in a prod.env file all my production variables  and when deploying to production add the --env-file:prod.env flag?

3 [2017-12-01T09:19:02] <Cosbgn> denel-manilov: thanks for helping out
4 [2017-12-01T09:20:05] <Cosbgn> so you would use hardcoded database username & password for production in the Dockerfile and a dev.env file which overwrites those variables while local?
5 [2017-12-01T09:20:50] <Cosbgn> and then I use something like .dockerignore to skip uploading compleately my dev.env so docker picks up directly the vars in the docker file
6 [2017-12-01T09:20:57] <Cosbgn> right?
7 [2017-12-01T09:34:33] <siassaj> so yeah
8 [2017-12-01T09:35:01] <siassaj> is it possible to run docker-compose and specify the host mount directory ?
9 [2017-12-01T09:36:14] <siassaj> I'm making this up, but maybe something along the lines of 'docker-compose up --mount <name> /path/to/app/git/dir'

2 [2017-12-01T12:15:49] <Cosbgn> I get docker to run my app
3 [2017-12-01T12:16:14] <Cosbgn> it tells me that [2017-12-01 12:05:53 +0000] [14] [INFO] Listening at: [<-LINK->] (14)
4 [2017-12-01T12:16:27] <Cosbgn> however nothing loads on 0.0.0.0:8000
5 [2017-12-01T12:16:49] <Cosbgn> I'm not sure where to find my app. I looked up the IP for nginx, and for the django app
6 [2017-12-01T12:17:02] <Cosbgn> i.e. [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-12-01T12:17:13] <Cosbgn> but also there nothing...
8 [2017-12-01T12:17:20] <Cosbgn> where it's running>
9 [2017-12-01T12:17:22] <Cosbgn> ??
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-01T13:18:22] <grofit> your local docker container may be running at 8000 but you need to expose that port right?
2 [2017-12-01T13:18:37] <grofit> so you may map that port from the container (8000) to the host (23456)
3 [2017-12-01T13:18:51] <grofit> so then it would be localhost:23456
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-01T15:59:07] <denel-manilov> @siassaj Command  "docker-compose up" does not have the option: --mountI\'m making this up, but maybe something along the lines of \'docker-compose up --mount <name> /path/to/app/git/dir\'
2 [2017-12-01T16:01:14] <denel-manilov> @siassaj https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumesis it possible to run docker-compose and specify the host mount directory ?

10 [2017-12-01T16:21:21] <denel-manilov> why do you have a prefix: ANALYTICME_ ?The docker-compose creates it automatically from the name of the directory in which the docker-compose.yml file
11 [2017-12-01T16:22:15] <Cosbgn> oh I see
12 [2017-12-01T16:22:26] <Cosbgn> I just read that it needs to be a unique name, that's why
13 [2017-12-01T16:22:37] <Cosbgn> better if I can remove it

1 [2017-12-03T06:18:52] <PRIMETSS> koolay Linux or Windows container?
2 [2017-12-03T06:19:11] <PRIMETSS> Found this from Docker CLI \'docker inspect <container name or id> |grep MacAddress|tr -d \' ,"\'|sort -u\'
3 [2017-12-03T06:23:51] <PRIMETSS> what language?
4 [2017-12-03T06:24:18] <koolay> cython
5 [2017-12-03T06:25:16] <PRIMETSS> ok, not sure about cython, but have you just tried obtaining MAC from its API? assuming it has that. Guess you will get back the hosts MAC address, interesting
6 [2017-12-03T06:29:11] <PRIMETSS> can you just call python [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-12-03T06:29:19] <koolay> obtained only container’s MAC in container
8 [2017-12-03T06:37:58] <PRIMETSS> which is different to the host's?
9 [2017-12-03T06:38:04] <koolay> Maybe I’ll using anther solution. Running a license server in host, then the app verify license  with license server, since license server can obtain id of host.
10 [2017-12-03T06:39:36] <PRIMETSS> yeah thats what I was thinking... seems a bit cluncky to have to call another service outside of container, but then again if it works that way, why not
11 [2017-12-03T06:40:09] <koolay> MAC of container is changed
12 [2017-12-03T06:41:39] <PRIMETSS> interesting to know its another MAC? was wondering what you would see... MACs are partly bound to Manufacture of NIC, so was the container MAC a 'psuedo' MAC or still had the hardware owners identifier in it?
13 [2017-12-03T06:44:44] <koolay> sudo docker run --rm --mac-address"=12:34b0:6b:61" ubuntu ifconfig | grep HWaddreth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 12:34b0:6b:61

15 [2017-12-03T06:47:14] <PRIMETSS> hmmm, but doesnt that mean someone can just spoof the MAC address and bypass what your planing. IF im following
16 [2017-12-03T06:52:49] <koolay> oh. I need to license my app bound the host.
17 [2017-12-03T06:59:52] <PRIMETSS> sure but from above, are you know just spoofing an address any way?
18 [2017-12-03T07:00:02] <PRIMETSS> know aka not

3 [2017-12-03T15:22:25] <Cosbgn> I'm trying to understand how to avoid that in development
4 [2017-12-03T15:22:42] <Cosbgn> I think that I understood that using volumes is the way to go
5 [2017-12-03T15:23:31] <Cosbgn> is that right?
6 [2017-12-03T15:24:05] <Cosbgn> on my nginx image I have these volumes: [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-12-03T15:24:40] <Cosbgn> while on my web I have: [<-CODE->]
8 [2017-12-03T15:25:32] <Cosbgn> does this.:/codemeans: the local folders in this path (.) represent the folders in the container under the path/code?
9 [2017-12-03T15:26:23] <Cosbgn> if this is the case, why it doesn't work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-04T18:09:44] <przemolb> Guys, do you have an idea how to manage hundreds or thousands of docker containers each with volume mounted on a host(s) ? Any tools helping with it ?
2 [2017-12-04T23:40:01] <przemolb> collin5: sorry but I think I haven't described my scenario precisely enough - all the containers (100s, or 1000s) use volumes. But because the containers are disposable they can be started again on another host. What happens with the volumes ? How to do track them ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-04T18:21:17] <gaborvecsei> How can I switch between training on CPU and GPU?I need 2 different environments with the different tensorflow versions?
2 [2017-12-04T19:10:34] <collin5> przemolb: I think you can usedocker composefor that, unless you need anything in particular.

1 [2017-12-04T22:25:00] <niklas-sm> Hey there! I\'m trying to write a Jenkins pipeline job to do a simple CI loop (building a few dockerfiles, pushing images, and then running some tests on downstream code that uses these images). To have everything scripted and visible for reviewers, I\'d like to run this CI loop from within a container on a jenkins slave. I\'ve found a few useful resources talking about this model. Can anyone help me with a few quick questions? First, is this a reasonable use-case (running one container from which to build and push a few other containers), or should I use some other tool to script my CI build environment (maybe using Packer to make a suitable AMI for my worker), and then just rundocker build ...anddocker push ...from a plain linux environment? Second, assuming this is a reasonable use case, is there an authoritative resource I should refer to for this type of configuration? I am bind mounting the docker socket into the "outer" container, but I\'m not sure how to start the docker daemon inside that container (attempting a simple minded approach of just doingsystemctl start dockerin the container  fails with "Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation not permitted")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-05T00:24:02] <cheenamalhotra> przemolb: When you create a volume, it is stored within a directory on the Docker host. When you mount the volume into a container, this directory is what is mounted into the container. This is similar to the way that bind mounts work, except that volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine.A given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously. When no running container is using a volume, the volume is still available to Docker and is not removed automatically. You can remove unused volumes using docker volume prune.
2 [2017-12-05T00:30:16] <cheenamalhotra> Cosbgn:  [<-ISSUE->] have a look!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-05T14:55:17] <crebuh> Hey guys, anybody here who is docker in combination with frontend apps, for example build with angular?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-05T17:09:57] <outkaj> Hey all, probably something simple I'm missing, but I'm trying to restore data from a backup like this:docker run --rm \\\n --volume VOLUME_NAME:/tmp/data \\\n --volume $(pwd):/tmp/backup \\\n alpine:latest \\\n tar xvf BACKUP_ARCHIVE -C /tmp/data --strip 1\ndocker cp /tmp/data CONTAINER_NAME:VOLUME_DIRECTORY_ON_CONTAINER. However, when I stop and start CONTAINER_NAME, I still see the old data, rather than the restored volume. What else should I do to make this work (or is there a better way I'm missing?)
2 [2017-12-05T17:14:09] <outkaj> przemolb: I wonder if something like this would be helpful to you as a volume management tool? ( [<-LINK->] ). Rancher in general will probably help as well since you have so many containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-06T08:55:58] <lanwin> Hi. What options do I have to discover service endpoints (from outside of the cluster) in a Swarm Mode cluster when Ingress is not available?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-06T14:46:48] <grofit> When I do adocker build .what is actually happening at a high level? I assumed it would create a container for this but not run it, but it does appear to run the container too, so is a docker build basically doing a run as well?
2 [2017-12-06T14:59:21] <grofit> I am using docker for windows (with windows containers) currently
3 [2017-12-06T14:59:27] <grofit> but its often quite dead in here
4 [2017-12-06T14:59:34] <OnamChilwan> lol OK
5 [2017-12-06T14:59:35] <grofit> but know of no better place to ask questions
6 [2017-12-06T14:59:48] <OnamChilwan> would you mind if I pick your brain please :)
7 [2017-12-06T15:24:33] <grofit> hmm not done that yet, we just copy out build output directly over to an iis running container
8 [2017-12-06T15:24:41] <grofit> so dont do the actual build on the container (Atm)
9 [2017-12-06T15:24:49] <grofit> hardest bit is trying to get clamav runnign on windows :(
10 [2017-12-06T15:25:15] <grofit> I have a docker container that does it, but it seems to RUN it when it build so it never finishes the build
11 [2017-12-06T15:25:24] <grofit> as its just running .... so not sure what to do there
12 [2017-12-06T15:27:49] <OnamChilwan> web api app
13 [2017-12-06T15:28:21] <OnamChilwan> I have replicated this. Just added a new Web Application project and hitdocker buildsame thing [<-CODE->]
14 [2017-12-06T15:31:08] <grofit> OH....
15 [2017-12-06T15:31:11] <OnamChilwan> jclagache: I guess everything in core is a console application
16 [2017-12-06T15:31:24] <grofit> IsEntryPointmeant to be the starting RUN to do?
17 [2017-12-06T15:31:29] <grofit> I think thats where I am going wrong :)
18 [2017-12-06T15:36:40] <OnamChilwan> grofit: not sure what you mean :)
19 [2017-12-06T15:37:46] <jclagache> COPY . ./before publish
20 [2017-12-06T15:43:16] <jclagache> you only have copied the project files
21 [2017-12-06T15:50:42] <OnamChilwan> Thats the only thing thats required right?
22 [2017-12-06T15:51:25] <OnamChilwan> as the restore and publish will resolve everything else it needs
23 [2017-12-06T15:54:13] <jclagache> that's what I see missing
24 [2017-12-06T15:58:49] <OnamChilwan> this is me just trying to get it to run locally
25 [2017-12-06T16:48:12] <jclagache> OnamChilwan: I've reproduced your pb and successfully resolved it withCOPY . ./
26 [2017-12-06T16:58:37] <OnamChilwan> Oh
27 [2017-12-06T16:58:49] <OnamChilwan> can you post your dockerfile please@jclagache
28 [2017-12-06T17:00:24] <OnamChilwan> oh my dear lord!
29 [2017-12-06T17:24:42] <OnamChilwan> That worked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-06T14:56:52] <OnamChilwan> Hi all, is this the place for docker windows too or is there a seperate channel for this?
2 [2017-12-06T15:03:59] <OnamChilwan> I am having issues with configuring a dockerfile using aspcore
3 [2017-12-06T15:04:44] <OnamChilwan> simple setup works fine (single project file) but when I have a project file referencing another project file I am having issues
4 [2017-12-06T15:06:54] <jclagache> OnamChilwan: What issues ?
5 [2017-12-06T15:11:19] <OnamChilwan> so I have a setup which is like this:.slnProject1/Project1.csproj\nProject1/Dockerfile\nProject2/Project2.csprojProject1 references Project2
6 [2017-12-06T15:11:32] <OnamChilwan> Docker file looks like [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-12-06T15:12:32] <OnamChilwan> However, it fails suggesting an error: CS5001 no suitable entry point for /app/Project1.csproj.
8 [2017-12-06T15:13:00] <OnamChilwan> But I definately have aprogam.csand an entry pointstatic void main
9 [2017-12-06T15:14:53] <jclagache> S5001 no suitable entry point for /app/Project1.dllright ?
10 [2017-12-06T15:15:11] <OnamChilwan> yeah
11 [2017-12-06T15:15:16] <OnamChilwan> sorry no
12 [2017-12-06T15:15:40] <OnamChilwan> it actually says no suitable entrypoint for the/app/Project1.csproj
13 [2017-12-06T15:15:46] <OnamChilwan> I know that is weird
14 [2017-12-06T15:16:30] <OnamChilwan> don't know why its got a hold of the.csprojas opposed to thedll
15 [2017-12-06T15:17:39] <OnamChilwan> it looks like the publish fails
16 [2017-12-06T15:17:47] <OnamChilwan> however if I run that on my machine it works fine
17 [2017-12-06T15:18:10] <OnamChilwan> I have tried running the container in an interactive terminal and get the same issue
18 [2017-12-06T15:18:43] <OnamChilwan> as in via the terminal rundotnet publishand it can't detect an entry point
19 [2017-12-06T15:27:30] <jclagache> Project1 is a console application ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-06T15:02:02] <pjetr> I tend to create a post on [<-LINK->] and try to get a discussion on the roll here :-D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-06T15:54:22] <grofit>  [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-12-06T15:54:33] <grofit> Originally I didnt have the entry point and was wondering why the docker build was just running forever
3 [2017-12-06T15:54:48] <grofit> but then once I saw your bit I realised I needed to have the last commandclamdto be an entry point
4 [2017-12-06T16:01:45] <grofit> yeah yeah, but thanks to seeing your stuff, it helped me solve my own
5 [2017-12-06T16:01:47] <grofit> so as you were soldier
6 [2017-12-06T16:01:49] <grofit> nothing to see here
7 [2017-12-06T16:03:26] <OnamChilwan> lol OK :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T08:27:23] <echiphn> Hi guys, last time I've tried to run docker on Mac Os and got a big issue with mount point between host machine and container. I've tried to share a java working directory but the IO speed in container is extreme slow. The web application can not run inside container. I've found some doc in docker page talked about this issue. But I haven't found any good solution from Docker for this issue ...
2 [2017-12-07T09:27:57] <grofit> I have a windows container which runs fine locally
3 [2017-12-07T09:28:10] <grofit> but when I pushed it up to docker hub it doesnt work, no errors
4 [2017-12-07T09:28:25] <grofit> DockerHub does support windows images from what I can tell
5 [2017-12-07T09:28:30] <grofit> so is there anything magic I need to do?
6 [2017-12-07T09:28:52] <grofit> the output from the push was: [<-CODE->]
7 [2017-12-07T09:31:14] <grofit> and if I dodocker run myimageit runs fine, no problems
8 [2017-12-07T09:31:28] <grofit> if I get the version from docker hub and run it, just hangs
9 [2017-12-07T09:32:18] <echiphn> rkitover: actually that is what I don't want. I want to synchronize between theses folders. I'm trying to implement Vagant concept using Docker. Developer can use any Idea ,editors he want to edit the code, but to test and run app he has to have same infrastructure like other guys
10 [2017-12-07T10:30:54] <grofit> hmm think it may be something to do with Kitematic as it works fine if I do a command line run, just when doing it through kitematic it falls over
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T08:34:02] <rkitover> you could try SMB or something, or just copy the directory if you can do that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T16:41:47] <miriam-z> Hi I have a ruby and docker set up for application in ruby I have changed my file name and in docker drone in the pipelines my test failed it says that it cannot find the previous file name his go fix this
2 [2017-12-07T18:39:13] <miriam-z> denel-manilov: I have changed the file locally in my feature branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T16:48:22] <hinell> Hi guys. Any ideas how to force docker vm machine to use convenient ip4 address version?
2 [2017-12-07T16:48:45] <hinell> I'm getting only ip6 address: [<-CODE->]
3 [2017-12-07T18:44:55] <hinell> denel-manilov: Yep, hyper-v. Already solved by setting --hyperv-virtual-switch explicitly. Now it works properly. IP6 address above is emerging from docker nat internal network. Now it is ok.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T16:58:10] <denel-manilov> hinell: HyperV vm?
2 [2017-12-07T17:10:31] <denel-manilov> miriam-z: where the file name is changed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T19:02:08] <denel-manilov> miriam-z: insufficient information about the problem. Perhaps you need to rebuild the image or configure the tests with a new file name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T23:17:45] <xenoterracide> if I have this [<-CODE->] does that mean I can use overlay but only on xfs?
2 [2017-12-07T23:46:52] <xenoterracide> rkitover: could mean you're out of inodes, I require more evidence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-07T23:19:42] <rkitover> I wanted to commit an exited container, but it told me that it ran out of space, yet I have plenty of space on my drive, what does that mean.
2 [2017-12-08T01:13:48] <rkitover> well df -h says the overlay is 63G and I used 54G
3 [2017-12-08T01:14:08] <rkitover> that's not configurable is it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T03:08:37] <airtonix>  [<-CODE->] the task is : [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-12-08T03:12:18] <airtonix> maybe i should also be using the [<-CODE->] flag of git.
3 [2017-12-08T03:59:17] <airtonix> ugh, wrong channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T10:11:21] <fiture> Hi, guys. Is anyway to access the virtual machine in docker for win. Hyper-v
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T10:26:22] <grofit> Hmm tried askign on Kitematic but seems to be dead in there, does anyone know why when running locally this image works, but when I run it in Kitematic from docker hub it doesnt?https://github.com/grofit/docker-s3rver-windows/blob/master/dockerfile [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T12:36:09] <Cosbgn> hello, I can't output my bundle.js in any possible way inside docker. I tried everything, can you please have a quick look here and help me out? [<-LINK->]
2 [2017-12-08T12:36:39] <Cosbgn> some help would be reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeealy appreciated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T12:58:33] <jsbot> Hello. Guys maybe stupid question but. Where is better place to run MEAN app with docker?
2 [2017-12-08T13:00:46] <grofit> you just mean a host for your docker image?
3 [2017-12-08T13:01:01] <grofit> if you want it on the cheap with SSL support look at openshift
4 [2017-12-08T13:01:11] <grofit> if you want more control over things look at AWS
5 [2017-12-08T13:02:30] <jsbot> can't find good tutorial how to deploy and run MEAN dockers on AWS
6 [2017-12-08T13:03:30] <grofit> well just tackle each problem
7 [2017-12-08T13:03:55] <jsbot> ok.
8 [2017-12-08T13:04:05] <grofit> you need to run Mongo, Node
9 [2017-12-08T13:04:22] <jsbot> i need run angular, node and probably mongo
10 [2017-12-08T13:04:32] <grofit> So thats gonna be a docker compose (I think) which pulls in both a mongo instance (whichever one you want) and a node instance
11 [2017-12-08T13:04:47] <grofit> Then you need your app container
12 [2017-12-08T13:04:48] <jsbot> yep locally i'm using it
13 [2017-12-08T13:04:58] <jsbot> but can't figure out how to do it on aws
14 [2017-12-08T13:05:01] <grofit> So that would contain the NPM guff for express, ng etc
15 [2017-12-08T13:05:05] <grofit> forget AWS atm
16 [2017-12-08T13:05:09] <grofit> just get it running locally
17 [2017-12-08T13:05:33] <grofit> then just google "docker compose to aws"
18 [2017-12-08T13:05:38] <jsbot> it's running locally
19 [2017-12-08T13:05:50] <grofit> oh well you have a docker compose right which marries everything up?
20 [2017-12-08T13:05:51] <jsbot> but i want deploy it on AWS
21 [2017-12-08T13:05:56] <jsbot> yep
22 [2017-12-08T13:06:24] <jsbot> deploy AWS or any other service where i can point to
23 [2017-12-08T13:06:29] <jsbot> and have it live
24 [2017-12-08T13:06:30] <grofit>  [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-12-08T13:06:36] <grofit> thats the first link on google
26 [2017-12-08T13:06:43] <grofit> that explains basics
27 [2017-12-08T13:07:03] <grofit> as the amazon CLI supports the docker compose file
28 [2017-12-08T13:07:19] <grofit> so you basically just find out the AWS commands and give it your compose file
29 [2017-12-08T13:07:58] <grofit> you could technically do it all without compose as just a single image which pulls in node and mongo on same container, but I would probably do it as a compose for flexibility and scaleability
30 [2017-12-08T13:18:50] <grofit> this gets onto a more complex debate on how you control individual instances
31 [2017-12-08T13:18:54] <grofit> and I cannot really help you there
32 [2017-12-08T13:19:43] <grofit> my understanding is you tell AWS (in this example) what types of instances to provision then give it the compose for the cluster and it provisions the right stuff for you, but I dont know enough about AWS specifically in this scenario to advise further
33 [2017-12-08T13:23:58] <jsbot> i see
34 [2017-12-08T13:24:03] <jsbot> thank you
35 [2017-12-08T13:24:17] <jsbot> will dig more
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T13:15:42] <jsbot> what if  deploy each container as separate instance?
2 [2017-12-08T13:15:57] <jsbot> and based on load add new instance?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T15:58:47] <Richard87> Hi guys! I need some advice :/ I am starting 4 services with docker compose (apache+php, redis, mysql and mailhog), apache is available on port 80, mysql on port 3307 and mailhog on port 8025
2 [2017-12-08T15:59:09] <Richard87> BUT I can't reach mailhog :/ Everything else works as expected, but I can't open it.. any idea?

1 [2017-12-08T16:13:05] <xenoterracide>  [<-CODE->] does this mean I can only use xfs for overlay and not ext4?

1 [2017-12-08T18:05:30] <edmondo1984> Hello, we are running an OpenVPN client locally, and when I tried to reach from inside a docker container on mac running on --net=host the ip of the VPN
2 [2017-12-08T18:05:32] <edmondo1984> it just takes forever
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-08T21:16:10] <xenoterracide> can a docker container access it's host network daemon via tcp? instead of socket?

1 [2017-12-08T21:43:39] <denel-manilov> Yes. The Docker daemon can listen for Docker Engine API requests via three different types of Socket: unix, tcp, and fd.

1 [2017-12-10T16:43:01] <bluemmb> Hi ... Can docker services load balance such that at each time only one request work on each container ?
2 [2017-12-10T16:43:14] <bluemmb> and the extra requests are queued for processing
3 [2017-12-10T18:01:08] <bluemmb> Thanks in advance
4 [2017-12-11T05:26:40] <bluemmb> SISheogorath: thanks ... reverse proxy inside the container or outside ?
5 [2017-12-11T05:34:06] <bluemmb> more precisely (if it helps), I am under pressure of my manager to remove RabbitMQ that is serving the workers inside a service and config the Docker Service such that it does the same thing
6 [2017-12-11T05:34:35] <bluemmb> workers should do only one job at a time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T01:52:43] <SISheogorath> Since docker itself only does L4 load balancing, no. But with the right reverse Proxy it probably possible

1 [2017-12-11T14:43:35] <Richard87> Hi guys, I have an application container (php+apache) where all the code etc is inside the docker image... but It's incredibly slow! (again, the container have no volume mounts), it takes about 3-4sec pr request (testet with [<-LINK->] ) while the regular linux host processes a request in 200-300ms... What can I do?

4 [2017-12-11T19:07:52] <Richard87> Guys, I have a new problem, on Fedora27 this time, suddenly docker didn't list any images or containers, after rebooting, it doesn't start
5 [2017-12-11T19:07:55] <Richard87> Failed to start Docker Application Container Engine.
6 [2017-12-11T19:08:19] <Richard87> (I have tried disabling selinux, downgrading/upgrading docker etc, no change :S )
7 [2017-12-11T20:40:18] <Richard87> Hi, its not a container issue, I can't start Docker at all on the host :/
8 [2017-12-11T20:40:28] <Richard87> (I have disabled selinux for the time beeing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T16:43:21] <smashingx1> Does a replica on a swarm mean on how many workers I want my service running?
2 [2017-12-11T16:44:57] <smashingx1> What I would like to do is to start a service on a swarm (postgresql for example) and then if a worker for a reason fails it has a failover to another server (I currently have 1 manager and 2 workers) so my question is how many replicas do I need?
3 [2017-12-11T17:08:53] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: So I can have 1 replica spread along my 2 workers and 1 manager correct?
4 [2017-12-11T17:10:14] <SISheogorath> yes, but as I said, you have to take care about replicating your persistant data on these hosts
5 [2017-12-11T17:22:10] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: Does docker take care of this?
6 [2017-12-11T17:41:23] <SISheogorath> nope
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T17:05:56] <SISheogorath> A replica is actually only the number of instances of a service should run. This can result in multiple instances run on the same machine. So be aware of that when you deploy something. Also keep in mind you have to take care of replication when you for example run multiple Postgres instances. Or in general how you push the data to your instances.
2 [2017-12-11T17:06:56] <SISheogorath> So you need some kind of shared and/or replicated storage for your Postgres instance even when you only run one replica but want to to automatically fail over

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T20:37:19] <xenoterracide> can you expose the docker api to a container? on a reliable ip?
2 [2017-12-11T20:39:46] <xenoterracide> Richard87: I saw something recently about Fedora making some recent change to SELinux, and essentially waiting for bug reports to come in
3 [2017-12-11T20:41:00] <xenoterracide> Richard87: you might want to go look up that change I was talking about, even if you've disabled SELinux
4 [2017-12-11T20:41:18] <xenoterracide> and your errors as given aren't actually helpful
5 [2017-12-11T20:41:42] <Richard87> hehe, thanks, I'll look into it, but what do you mean expose docker api to a container?
6 [2017-12-11T20:42:40] <Richard87>  [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-12-11T20:43:16] <Richard87> systemctl start dockerjust hangs (and never completes),,, running it manually dropscontainerd health check returned error: rpc error: code = 14 desc = grpc: the connection is unavailable
8 [2017-12-11T20:43:47] <Richard87> as I said, I can't run any containers, I can't run docker info or docker ps :/
9 [2017-12-11T20:43:54] <Richard87> (maybe I'm misunderstanding)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T20:43:13] <xenoterracide> docker has an api you can connect to over tcp? maybe http? that you can communicate with, and I'm trying to figure out if there's a simple way to expose it to a container app, so that app can communicate with that instead of a volume bound /var/run/docker.sock (or whatever)
2 [2017-12-11T20:43:59] <xenoterracide> well that's because your daemon doesn't start
3 [2017-12-11T20:44:08] <xenoterracide> I'd check your system logs
4 [2017-12-11T20:44:15] <xenoterracide> journalctl
5 [2017-12-11T20:44:28] <Richard87> yeah, because I get an error from containerd, grpc: the connection is unavailable
6 [2017-12-11T20:45:35] <Richard87> I have no idea how to move forward :(
7 [2017-12-11T20:45:56] <xenoterracide> check your seystem logs
8 [2017-12-11T20:46:07] <xenoterracide> or is that all the errors in those too?
9 [2017-12-11T20:46:55] <Richard87> I have some weird erros in the firewall log

11 [2017-12-11T20:47:24] <xenoterracide> indeed that looks weird

13 [2017-12-11T20:47:59] <xenoterracide> and to investigate those errors I'd start looking at iptables, 'cause it could be your problem
14 [2017-12-11T20:48:18] <Richard87> nothing at all... systemctl start docker never completes, and never fails
15 [2017-12-11T20:50:59] <xenoterracide> journalctldidn't log anything? weird
16 [2017-12-11T20:51:15] <xenoterracide> so yeah, I'd investigate your firewall issues
17 [2017-12-11T20:51:28] <xenoterracide> could be you're blocking the port
18 [2017-12-11T20:53:25] <Richard87> thanks, I'll investigate... btw, any idea aboutdocker-containerd?

21 [2017-12-11T20:54:41] <xenoterracide> so...
22 [2017-12-11T20:55:04] <xenoterracide> maybe your volume storage is set up wrong?
23 [2017-12-11T20:55:19] <xenoterracide> and by the way, those logs would have been visible injournalctl
24 [2017-12-11T20:55:33] <xenoterracide> maybe tryjournalctl -u docker
25 [2017-12-11T20:55:54] <Richard87> thanks..

1 [2017-12-11T20:57:30] <SISheogorath> Richard87: Do you run docker-ce from docker.io or from Fedora repos?
2 [2017-12-11T20:58:32] <SISheogorath> That's why I'm asking ^^
3 [2017-12-11T21:17:44] <SISheogorath> Richard87: could you please uninstalldocker-ceand/ordocker, delete/var/lib/docker, rundnf update --refresh, reboot and reinstalldocker?
4 [2017-12-11T21:17:53] <SISheogorath> then try again what ever you are working on :D
5 [2017-12-11T21:21:38] <SISheogorath> ShawnAbshire: What host OS are you using?
6 [2017-12-11T21:23:45] <Richard87> haha, yeah, I'll give it a try ;) Thanks for all your advices ;)
7 [2017-12-11T21:39:49] <SISheogorath> Richard87: Sry for not coming up with a better solution, but from my perspective it looks like you broke your setup :D
8 [2017-12-11T21:40:54] <SISheogorath> xenoterracide: storage driver is not volume driver. So no.
9 [2017-12-11T21:41:15] <xenoterracide> but don't volumes use the storage driver?
10 [2017-12-11T21:41:24] <xenoterracide> just trying to understand how that works
11 [2017-12-11T21:41:51] <xenoterracide> since drivers are somewhat newer than my initial understanding of volumes
12 [2017-12-11T21:45:48] <xenoterracide> so what's a storage driver for then? why should I care about that?
13 [2017-12-11T21:46:48] <xenoterracide> just trying to ensure that whatever I\'m doing to ensure my "EBS" volume survives instance termination works right and is perfomant
14 [2017-12-11T21:46:54] <SISheogorath> xenoterracide: storage drivers are for images. Since you use a layered filesystem for images
15 [2017-12-11T21:47:56] <SISheogorath> xenoterracide: sounds like you are looking for docker for aws
16 [2017-12-11T21:48:16] <xenoterracide> well, yes, but I'm implementing it
17 [2017-12-11T21:48:41] <xenoterracide> oh interesting

1 [2017-12-11T21:12:03] <ShawnAbshire> Greetings all, so I'm struggling to find any resources about using a windows 10 virtual machine to create docker images.  Is this possible?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T21:39:53] <xenoterracide> if you're using overlay, does that mean that your volumes are actually stored in/var/lib/docker/overlay?
2 [2017-12-11T21:40:03] <Richard87> yeah
3 [2017-12-11T21:40:08] <Richard87> It seems like it :/
4 [2017-12-11T21:40:19] <Richard87> Don't realy understand how those drivers work
5 [2017-12-11T21:40:32] <Richard87> but It seems the data is in the volumes folder
6 [2017-12-11T21:41:15] <Richard87> hmm, I have created a named volume, where all the data is stored?
7 [2017-12-11T21:41:25] <Richard87> which is in ./volume folder?
8 [2017-12-11T21:42:33] <Richard87> hehe
9 [2017-12-11T21:42:44] <Richard87> I have no f**clue
10 [2017-12-11T21:43:00] <xenoterracide> I thought maybe the mad god@SISheogorathdid
11 [2017-12-11T21:45:18] <SISheogorath> xenoterracide: guess what, volumes use volume-drivers ;)

13 [2017-12-11T21:48:54] <SISheogorath> you're welcome ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-11T21:50:48] <xenoterracide> SISheogorath: I admit to skimming, is thiscloudstorjust generally available as part of Docker CE?
2 [2017-12-11T21:51:32] <SISheogorath> iirc you can get it as docker plugin, so yes
3 [2017-12-11T21:52:03] <xenoterracide> ah it's a plugin hmm... now how do I get that on centos
4 [2017-12-11T21:56:15] <SISheogorath> I'm not totally sure forcloudstorbut docker4x has it available. Maybe check that out or trydocker plugin install cloudstor:aws
5 [2017-12-11T21:56:29] <SISheogorath> but keep in mind you need an up to date docker version for that
6 [2017-12-11T21:58:53] <xenoterracide> yeah I'm using the latest LTS CE
7 [2017-12-11T21:59:05] <xenoterracide> at least on this refactor away from ECS
8 [2017-12-11T21:59:09] <xenoterracide> which is all that matters
9 [2017-12-11T22:23:04] <xenoterracide>  [<-CODE->] hmm
10 [2017-12-11T22:25:29] <SISheogorath> docker plugin install docker4x/cloudstor:17.09.0-ce-aws1
11 [2017-12-11T22:44:18] <xenoterracide> hmm
12 [2017-12-11T22:44:26] <xenoterracide>  [<-CODE->]
13 [2017-12-11T22:53:41] <xenoterracide> SISheogorath: seems that this solution requires me to run all the things it wants, like cloudformation
14 [2017-12-11T22:54:18] <SISheogorath> I never used it
15 [2017-12-11T22:54:32] <SISheogorath> Can't say anything about it in detail
16 [2017-12-11T22:54:36] <SISheogorath> only know it exists
17 [2017-12-11T22:54:49] <SISheogorath> The recommended way is to use docker for AWS
18 [2017-12-11T23:25:29] <xenoterracide> yeah, from the looks of it, it's too holistic for me, and the one reference I found to that error generally criticizes the stability
19 [2017-12-11T23:25:43] <xenoterracide> I'd love to have the volume support
20 [2017-12-11T23:25:53] <xenoterracide> because it would solve headaches

1 [2017-12-12T08:32:07] <przemolb> I would like to build a docker image with my application running inside. I don\'t want my application  to run as root so I can use "USER user1" for that. But is there any way I can add (in dockerfile) the whole folder with my application and keep it owned by "user1" but without using \'chown\' after ? I read somehow that chown in dockerfile is not the best way to do that ...
2 [2017-12-12T15:05:57] <przemolb> SISheogorath: chown the whole whole folder where the application resides. It needs the folder to function properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-12T13:51:28] <SISheogorath> przemolb: why chown the application?
2 [2017-12-12T13:52:12] <SISheogorath> only chown what you really need writeable
3 [2017-12-12T13:52:24] <SISheogorath> this improves your image's security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T08:30:45] <grofit> Does anyone know if there is a reason why docker images would work fine locally, but when the same image is pushed to docker hub then run via kitematic it fails to start
2 [2017-12-13T08:47:13] <grofit> let me try that, I assumed the local image I tagged was same as the one on docker hub
3 [2017-12-13T08:47:20] <grofit> so didnt bother pulling it
4 [2017-12-13T08:49:05] <grofit>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
5 [2017-12-13T08:49:15] <grofit> So that works fine
6 [2017-12-13T08:49:25] <grofit> let me just check how to delete image locally
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T08:38:13] <SISheogorath> different config? what happens when you delete the image locally, pull it and try to run it with the same command?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T08:51:36] <truthadjustr> grofit: mounted volunes is one of the reasons ..show us your Dockerfile content instead

6 [2017-12-13T08:54:00] <grofit> I have 2 windows containers that work fine locally but when using via kitematic they just seem to exit after starting, but other images work fine on there
7 [2017-12-13T08:54:06] <truthadjustr> grofit: im not into windows but do u think the base image exist in hub.docker.com?
8 [2017-12-13T08:54:39] <grofit> yeah it does one mo
9 [2017-12-13T08:55:22] <grofit> So there is mine:https://hub.docker.com/r/grofit/s3rver-windows/Here is the base image:https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/nanoserver/
10 [2017-12-13T08:56:59] <grofit> Problem I have is that they have a .net code base they would like to run within docker, which depends upon 3rd party bits, but as windows containers cannot run WITH linux ones without swarms etc its a pain, so just making windows compatible versions of the 3rd party libs so devs can just use these to host the relevant bits (as its not using .net core, just the old .net, so cant get away with hosting it in linux containers)
11 [2017-12-13T10:16:00] <grofit> Any ideas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T10:51:49] <SISheogorath> grofit: there is probably no solution than "fixing" the application.
2 [2017-12-13T10:51:53] <SISheogorath> or replace it
3 [2017-12-13T10:52:26] <grofit> when you say the application what do you mean?

2 [2017-12-13T11:43:50] <grofit> SISheogorath: Sorry to ping you, but when you said "The application" what did you actually mean? Kitematic or the image I was trying to deploy (or something else)?
3 [2017-12-13T14:58:45] <grofit> Any chance of a confirmation of what you meant by "application"
4 [2017-12-13T14:59:30] <grofit> as if this is possibly just a bug in kitematic (the kitematic room is dead, already asked there) I will just leave it as that (other windows containers run in there fine and seem same sort of dockerfile stuff as myself)
5 [2017-12-13T15:13:14] <grofit> thats easy enough to say but most people here are are not that used to docker, I am still a novice and Kitematic is an easier way for them to visually see in the windows eco system whats running and manage things from there
6 [2017-12-13T15:14:02] <truthadjustr> the CLI, is the easist way to work with docker and not the kitematic gui
7 [2017-12-13T15:14:24] <grofit> Sure for creating images and power users
8 [2017-12-13T15:14:44] <grofit> but for people who dont really care much about docker and just want to consume the code run a gulp/build script and then click something in a gui not so much
9 [2017-12-13T15:14:47] <truthadjustr> with GUIs, a lot is hidden, so it is harder to understand
10 [2017-12-13T15:15:04] <grofit> yeah but in an existing team, I am not here to teach them the ins and outs of docker
11 [2017-12-13T15:15:18] <grofit> I am looking for path of least resistence to get them using their stuff with docker
12 [2017-12-13T15:16:00] <grofit> so if I can say to them "just run the build script, go to your images in kitematic and press play" thats a lot better than trying to teach them how to pull, build, run etc
13 [2017-12-13T15:16:17] <truthadjustr> agree
14 [2017-12-13T15:16:54] <grofit> So ideal world I would like to understand why CLI works fine with images (as I am authoring them for the others here) but Kitematic doesnt, but only seemingly with my images as like I say other windows/linux containers work fine
15 [2017-12-13T15:17:14] <truthadjustr> i just learn today, that a lot of microsoft docker images is already around.. very interesting, these were not here just a year ago
16 [2017-12-13T15:17:36] <grofit> yeah, this is why now I am trying to get some traction on moving to docker based images for environments
17 [2017-12-13T15:17:48] <grofit> as with docker compose it makes a lot of stuff easier to just "run"
18 [2017-12-13T15:18:23] <grofit> but its more baby steps with the team adoption of it, if I can just show them a simple thing that works, I can build off that and get them more involved in CLI when they want to start authoring or altering stuff
19 [2017-12-13T15:18:48] <grofit> and like I say I only know basics of images and compose, not used swarm or other stuff yet
20 [2017-12-13T15:19:15] <grofit> but anyway this hurdle seems difficult to analyse as Kitematic just fails and the kitematic room is dead
21 [2017-12-13T15:19:51] <truthadjustr> ok, so.. from the CLI it works and runs but in kitematic it is not working?
22 [2017-12-13T15:19:55] <grofit> so if the problem is kitematic, I can just leave it as that and try to chase it up with kitematic people somewhere, or look for other GUI tools, if there are none then looks like I will need to get people involved with CLI from day one, which may cause issues with adoption
23 [2017-12-13T15:20:04] <grofit> yeah, as shown above with my CLI use
24 [2017-12-13T15:20:15] <grofit> if I remove the image, download it, run it locally it runs fine
25 [2017-12-13T15:20:35] <grofit> if I use kitematic and download it from docker hub via that and run it, it falls over
26 [2017-12-13T15:20:43] <truthadjustr> i can definitely say, .. the issue is with kitematic then
27 [2017-12-13T15:21:11] <grofit> kk thanks
28 [2017-12-13T15:21:20] <truthadjustr> there are better GUI you may try to check..
29 [2017-12-13T15:21:22] <grofit> just baffles me why other stuff works and mine doesnt, I assumed I was just doing something silly somewhere
30 [2017-12-13T15:21:25] <grofit> oh right
31 [2017-12-13T15:21:33] <grofit> what would you recommend (this is windows environment)
32 [2017-12-13T15:21:40] <truthadjustr> for example, my favorite isportainer
33 [2017-12-13T15:22:04] <grofit> kk will give it a look, kitematic support is built into Docker-For-Windows
34 [2017-12-13T15:22:11] <grofit> so it just seemed path of least resistance
35 [2017-12-13T15:22:14] <truthadjustr> then, you gave to your team the http console, and from there they will be swimming into containers via the web GUI
36 [2017-12-13T15:22:43] <truthadjustr> kitiematic is a personalized GUI in ones laptop...
37 [2017-12-13T15:23:10] <truthadjustr> portaineris a centralized way.. then your team create and run containers via web console
38 [2017-12-13T15:23:46] <grofit> ah right so its setup on one server and everyone uses that one for docker stuff?
39 [2017-12-13T15:23:55] <truthadjustr> correct
40 [2017-12-13T15:23:56] <grofit> that may not fly here as we want each dev machine to be its own environment
41 [2017-12-13T15:24:18] <grofit> rather than having a shared environment, as automated tests will be tearing down DBs and other related data
42 [2017-12-13T15:24:41] <grofit> so want devs to be able to spin up environments locally in docker, do their stuff then turn it off (via compose)
43 [2017-12-13T15:24:54] <truthadjustr> it is.. each machine to be its own dev yes. But then, when deploying to production.. you push the container/images to the the central place
44 [2017-12-13T15:25:16] <grofit> atm we would expect TeamCity to output the image as an artifact
45 [2017-12-13T15:25:29] <grofit> then that can be used to deploy to prod (be it AWS/Azure/Wherever)
46 [2017-12-13T15:26:09] <truthadjustr> i can see, that you are using hub.docker.com for collaborative deployment. You may, choose to have a local intranet docker registry and used that instead to exchange images and not hub.docker.com
47 [2017-12-13T15:26:28] <grofit> hmm maybe, atm the stuff I have put on docker hub is not unique to this project
48 [2017-12-13T15:27:04] <grofit> so its just generic bits we would need but not project specific, like we use ClamAV and S3 (via emulator for local use) so have just made OS windows containers for them to be consumed via the apps
49 [2017-12-13T15:27:17] <grofit> our "business" apps would as you say be in a private repo or exposed via TC or something
50 [2017-12-13T15:27:45] <grofit> still not entirely sure of best practice here, as the CI server exposes current builds etc, with Octo deploy for releasing, so just seems like moving the releasing part to a docker-esque handler
51 [2017-12-13T15:28:05] <truthadjustr> also, you can export a container.. it becomes a tar file.. copy it via USB and import it into another dev's machine...
52 [2017-12-13T15:29:03] <grofit> hmm I was planning on having the devs "env setup" build script would do the docker build etc locally, but again until we have this up and running across the team I cannot evaluate it
53 [2017-12-13T15:29:09] <grofit> but good to know you can do things that way
54 [2017-12-13T15:30:26] <truthadjustr> just drop the kitiematic roadblock that's hindering you.. kitematic is a very very small icing on the cake comparing to what is possible with docker ...
55 [2017-12-13T15:30:57] <grofit> well its not hindering me exactly, its just I can see it being easier for people to get their heads around it with a GUI tool for now
56 [2017-12-13T15:31:05] <grofit> but it is something I would like to solve
57 [2017-12-13T15:31:14] <grofit> as I could be doing something "wrong" that just works locally
58 [2017-12-13T15:31:41] <grofit> so its a worry that it may work fine on devs machines, but then when we went to a QA or Prod env etc it may fall over because of this issue, but like I say could just be kitematic, but I dont know why
59 [2017-12-13T15:32:11] <grofit> so its more of a niggling thing I would like to solve, but I can continue with my work without worrying about it

2 [2017-12-13T15:12:20] <SISheogorath> When it works fine by CLI, throw kitematic away
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T16:21:24] <drewboardman> hey, I'd like to have log output show when Idocker run. Is that possible?
2 [2017-12-13T16:21:37] <drewboardman> and have ittailthem so i can keep seeing output?
3 [2017-12-13T16:24:40] <truthadjustr> yes..docker logs -f containernamehere
4 [2017-12-13T16:26:29] <truthadjustr> but u can't use that if the container crashes (exited)...so u have do it fast to see the logs b4 it crashes...
5 [2017-12-13T16:27:09] <drewboardman> ok so like usingdocker run | awk '{docker logs -f $1}'
6 [2017-12-13T16:27:20] <drewboardman> or is there a docker way to do this?
7 [2017-12-13T16:27:22] <drewboardman> withoutawk
8 [2017-12-13T16:28:56] <truthadjustr> to each his own...i think u can see more realtime logs from the unix socket docker uses ..but its not for normal use
9 [2017-12-13T16:29:29] <drewboardman> what do you mean by that?
10 [2017-12-13T16:30:46] <drewboardman> my awk command is working btw
11 [2017-12-13T17:33:33] <drewboardman> i ended up using xargs
12 [2017-12-13T17:44:27] <truthadjustr> does it capture anything if the container crashes or won't start?
13 [2017-12-13T17:59:55] <drewboardman> not sure
14 [2017-12-13T18:00:06] <drewboardman> it's messed up right now, but hasn't failed to start yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T18:17:28] <SISheogorath> truthadjustr: it logs all std:out and std:err from your container.
2 [2017-12-13T18:17:46] <SISheogorath> Which means as long as 1 process starts in your container, yes. it's entire output is captured
3 [2017-12-13T18:18:54] <SISheogorath> if no process is started because you want to start a program in a path that doesn't exist, for example, it won't can't capture the output since there is no process. But it'll iirc tell you indocker ps -a
4 [2017-12-13T18:34:40] <SISheogorath> simply dodocker logson it. Logs persist as long as the container exists. So when you don't start it with--rmyou are fine
5 [2017-12-13T18:35:04] <SISheogorath> checkdocker ps -aif you need the container id, but names work withdocker logs, too
6 [2017-12-13T18:35:13] <SISheogorath> even when they are killed
7 [2017-12-13T19:28:38] <SISheogorath> don't use the -f flag for them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-13T18:33:48] <truthadjustr> SISheogorath: yes. Most often i am puzzled why a container won't run anddocker logs -fis too late to see the crash logs. Any tips for that?
2 [2017-12-13T18:37:34] <truthadjustr> aha..thanks. Halted containers only retain the  very last lines of the log...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T09:52:01] <grofit> Hello again, so a new question for today
2 [2017-12-14T09:53:21] <grofit> so lets say I have a web app which depends upon 2 other apis, so the web app by default is looking for localhost:3456 for one api and localhost:4567 for the other api. When writing my docker compose file the docs are not to clear on if/how you can tell the containers to have some sort of virtual network which has  these ports setup where expected
3 [2017-12-14T09:54:23] <grofit> Given each container is really gonna be its own "machine" in a way I am not sure if this will work and I will need to instead look at using some sort of network link so rather than it beinglocalhost:3456itsapi1or something, but its not clear on if you can setup the internal network hostnames and ports
4 [2017-12-14T09:54:35] <grofit> as most docs seem to detail setting up ports for the host to relay from the container
5 [2017-12-14T09:59:26] <grofit> so is there a way to let the web app just use localhost:3456/4567 without having to reference by the service name, and not externally exposing the ports on the host machine (just within the web container)
6 [2017-12-14T10:00:10] <grofit> as my understanding is that the EXPOSE command will automatically expose the ports inside the containers, so the ports are already exposed its just how you can reference lets sayapi1:3456aslocalhost:3456on the web machine
7 [2017-12-14T10:00:13] <grofit> any of this make sense?
8 [2017-12-14T13:42:33] <grofit> I dont think you push your composes anywhere
9 [2017-12-14T13:42:47] <grofit> as they are not images, more network setups
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T10:41:44] <MohamedShawky85> I facing an issue now i running the akka actor inside a docker container but when the container deleted the actor postStop() method not run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T13:31:08] <Cosbgn> hey everyone, when usingdocker-composeisdocker-compose buildthe equivalent ofdocker build?
2 [2017-12-14T13:31:32] <Cosbgn> as after that I would just usedocker pushetc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T15:15:16] <yosefrow> Docker compose is a fancy tool that builds and runs so yes you can push an image built with docker compose
2 [2017-12-14T16:14:50] <yosefrow> Your app is failing in some waydocker logs containernameorid
3 [2017-12-14T16:17:40] <drewboardman> it's not failing
4 [2017-12-14T16:17:46] <drewboardman> I can hit the app in the browser
5 [2017-12-14T16:17:48] <drewboardman> once
6 [2017-12-14T16:17:51] <drewboardman> and then the container exits
7 [2017-12-14T16:18:23] <drewboardman> it's like the script finishes, and then docker decides that the container can exit
8 [2017-12-14T16:20:58] <drewboardman>  [<-CODE->]
9 [2017-12-14T16:24:59] <yosefrow> Sorry misread ur issue
10 [2017-12-14T16:25:58] <yosefrow> Docker container depends on process to run when no process is left it exits
11 [2017-12-14T16:27:05] <yosefrow> There are ways to force it to stay alive like for example running sleep
12 [2017-12-14T16:27:50] <yosefrow> In your case your script
13 [2017-12-14T16:28:05] <yosefrow> Is finishing or failing
14 [2017-12-14T16:29:41] <yosefrow> When script stops no process is left alive so container exits
15 [2017-12-14T16:32:47] <yosefrow> grofit: EXPOSE in a dockerfile only documents ports to publish. Then to open them u have to publish at docker run with -p hostport:containerport
16 [2017-12-14T16:33:25] <yosefrow> EXPOSE doesnt open ports
17 [2017-12-14T16:40:09] <yosefrow> drewboardman: by default docker run will show u logs and b attached to the process so that if u interrupt the container will die. With -d you can detach and view the logs whenever u want with  'docker logs'
18 [2017-12-14T16:41:54] <yosefrow> Docker compose is orchestration 4 docker. You can docker run and set port to publish manually or specify in compose
19 [2017-12-14T16:42:22] <yosefrow> Dockerfile doesnt control ports
20 [2017-12-14T16:43:05] <yosefrow> Only docker run or orchestrators like compose that use docker run
21 [2017-12-14T16:44:20] <yosefrow> Expose means expose port requirement 4 all to see. Publish means publish port on host machine by adding rule to ur firewall
22 [2017-12-14T16:46:29] <yosefrow> Docker compose can link containers internally within docker by using docker virtual network features
23 [2017-12-14T16:59:34] <yosefrow> Not so. Compose letz you publish ports to host. But from container 2 container not needed
24 [2017-12-15T07:50:39] <yosefrow> huangyanxiong01: you can add any file to an image by putting 'COPY sourcepathoffile pathofileincontainer' inside the Dockerfile
25 [2017-12-15T07:53:34] <yosefrow> With 'RUN somecommand' you can run any command inside the image. Other than that im not sure what u are asking as it relates 2 docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T15:51:06] <drewboardman> hey, so I've noticed that when idocker runeverything goes fine - but when I actually visit the webserver on my host browser the container exits after the first page load
2 [2017-12-14T15:51:10] <drewboardman> is this expected?
3 [2017-12-14T15:51:17] <drewboardman> I'd like the container to be persistent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-14T16:40:10] <grofit> In compose doesn't it auto expose them to linked images?
2 [2017-12-14T16:40:48] <grofit> I thought you only needed ports specified on images in docker compose if you want them externally exposed to the host
3 [2017-12-14T16:53:32] <grofit> Yeah that must be the bit I meant as no examples set ports in compose files but they work, like you say with run you need explicit -p

1 [2017-12-16T21:22:35] <yosefrow> maxime1992: docker image commands go in dockerfile. Docker run commands are represented by docker compose, so for networks use docker compose. Though im not sure u can exactly configure the network w compose perhaps u can configure the net properties manually then add the networj name to compose
2 [2017-12-16T21:25:00] <yosefrow> patwalt: i had trouble to copy or add files in dockerfile unless they were in the same  or child of the same directory that the dockerfile is in
3 [2017-12-16T21:26:00] <yosefrow> Try copying the files or dir  into the dockerfile dir if its not a permissions issue
4 [2017-12-16T21:28:53] <yosefrow> kevincaradant: docker compose reads env variables from the .env file. So put USER=something in .env or try write a build script that does export USER=something b4 docker compose up. This might work too
5 [2017-12-17T07:07:26] <yosefrow> Glad i could help :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-17T08:43:45] <truthadjustr> what's the real use ofEXPOSEin Dockerfule it seems that I can still use p
2 [2017-12-17T08:45:00] <truthadjustr> ports without having them pre-declared in Dockerfile?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-17T10:17:16] <truthadjustr> In docker-compose.yml, is there an init ordering such as which container should be up first bcoz other containers depend on it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-17T11:06:20] <SISheogorath> truthadjustr: you should make sure that your containers don't care about the order they are started in
2 [2017-12-17T11:06:37] <SISheogorath> Check: [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-12-18T11:17:30] <SISheogorath> ppLorins: no. Storage drivers are global
4 [2017-12-18T11:17:54] <SISheogorath> But please recheck you don't mixup storage and volume drivers
5 [2017-12-18T11:35:32] <SISheogorath> What kernel version are you running?
6 [2017-12-18T11:36:05] <SISheogorath> Kernel version ->uname -a
7 [2017-12-18T11:36:54] <SISheogorath> overlay2 is only available in kernel version >4
8 [2017-12-18T11:37:12] <ppLorins> you mean linux kernel version ?
9 [2017-12-18T11:38:07] <SISheogorath> See: [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-12-18T11:38:12] <SISheogorath> yes, linux kernel version

1 [2017-12-17T23:19:56] <zebralight> hello. I was wondering if anyone here uses docker not just for deployment but also for development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-18T01:01:18] <NikIvan> zebralight: Yes, actively using docker for development to run for example redis and mysql instances. Works pretty well and usefull. Allows to be more flexible if you are working on lots of projects. You don't need to install for ex. mysql or redis to your local machine if you are using them only on one project and to be consistent with production environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-18T09:45:41] <ppLorins> Hi all , I want to specify different storage-drivers for the different containers, is there a way to do this ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-18T11:35:04] <ppLorins> SISheogorath: Yes , I didn't mixup them .  I tried add the the following to /etc/docker/daemon.json , but docker told me it doesn't supportoverlay2, how to make docker support that kind of storage driver?
2 [2017-12-18T11:35:32] <ppLorins> {"storage-driver": "overlay"\n}

6 [2017-12-18T11:36:38] <SISheogorath> well there is your answer :D
7 [2017-12-18T11:38:11] <ppLorins> alright.  actually I want limit disk space usage of containers , and found--storage-opt size=120Gis a solution .

1 [2017-12-18T19:34:11] <danielarnason> Hi all....new to Docker and I have a question......is there a way to add an empty environment variable in my docker-compose or .env file?
2 [2017-12-18T20:38:54] <danielarnason> I'm using an .env file to make some environment variables, such as DB_PASS and there is no password to the test database I am using (in the postgres.app on mac)
3 [2017-12-18T20:39:13] <danielarnason> this appearantly causes some issues
4 [2017-12-18T20:39:43] <danielarnason> if that's the case, then the problem lies elsewhere
5 [2017-12-18T20:40:02] <danielarnason> I'm just getting some wierd connection problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-18T19:37:05] <mab122> Why would you need an empty variable? Can't you just set it ... empty string or sth
2 [2017-12-18T20:39:17] <mab122> In that case you can literally do what I suggested.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-19T02:15:33] <jk-jx> Hi. I've create docker image as backup for my file everyday. Why I'm not even using the file, it still increase its size everyday? Not large but still increase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-19T03:13:55] <SISheogorath> Docker is neither a version control, nor a backup system .-. I neither understand why you did that, nor what for
2 [2017-12-19T09:34:12] <SISheogorath> mohanzeal: don't commit these changes directly. Use a Dockerfile to make them reproducible and put it into a git repository
3 [2017-12-19T12:57:06] <SISheogorath> mohanzeal: And?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-19T07:29:02] <mohanzeal> hi all. Is there anything like docker-compose commit... I have a docker-compose.yml in the root folder that spin up 5 different services with 5 different images. I made modifications for all the images.. now I want to commit those images... How can I do that
2 [2017-12-19T09:37:11] <mohanzeal> i did the same, created a Dockfile but the problem is that i have many dependency instructions listed in the dockerfile. It's taking a lot of time to build the image.

1 [2017-12-19T11:43:04] <DJFliX> Hi! Assuming I was stupid enough to think "Oh, the docker UI for Mac has the option to manage my swarm from the cloud, let\'s enable it". Am I able to revert this? Apparently my existing client certificate in my docker machine does not work anymore. I ssh\'d into the server and saw that the ca.pem is still in place. But runningdocker-machine lsyields:docker-manager-01         -        azure     Running   tcp://<redacted-ip>:2376                                  docker-manager (master)   Unknown   Unable to query docker version: Get https://<redacted-ip>:2376/v1.15/version: x509: cannot validate certificate for <redacted-ip> because it doesn\'t contain any IP SANs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-19T11:58:06] <rkitover> Are services down right now? I'm getting:Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:45660->[::1]:53: read: connection refused
2 [2017-12-19T12:05:18] <rkitover> oh it looks like a DNS lookup on localhost, but why is it doing that (this is docker for windows)
3 [2017-12-19T12:36:13] <rkitover> turning off ipv6 fixed it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 [2017-12-19T17:19:44] <yosefrow> Docker push myrepo/myimage
5 [2017-12-19T17:20:30] <yosefrow> Then u dont have 2 build image everywhere. Just docker pull
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-19T17:24:22] <truthadjustr> u can also save (in tar) an image, copy to usb drive and load it to another system..
2 [2017-12-19T17:25:45] <yosefrow> True but if ur saving u should use use docker save not docker export since it is lossy
3 [2017-12-19T17:26:10] <yosefrow> Make sure 2 use save and load
4 [2017-12-20T05:57:06] <yosefrow> Just a small distinction of docker export vs save: save will save an image or the image a container is based on and its metadata and layers. Export makes a copy of the filesystem of a running container.
5 [2017-12-21T05:55:10] <yosefrow> siassaj: i think same problem with single quotes sometimes. Been there too

7 [2017-12-21T05:59:33] <yosefrow> skarred14: sounds like could b a problem specific to mac os. On linux -v hostdir:dockerdir works fine. Make sure u are going to the right dir though. ~/.temp is not the same as  ./temp

2 [2017-12-21T09:12:55] <ppLorins> You mean the original content inside the container will gone ?
3 [2017-12-21T09:14:31] <SISheogorath> when you bindmount a directory inside a container, the path inside the container is replaced with the outside one. Not merged

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T09:12:04] <SISheogorath> simply recreate the link in your entrypoint script

1 [2017-12-21T14:24:38] <ndpratas> I guys, I need a really quick answer. How is the best way to ship stdout and stderr logs from docker container to ELK agnostic of the Cloud I'm using? Suppose I'm using azure/bluemix/ kubernetes PaaS. How it's the best way to do this?
2 [2017-12-21T17:58:22] <ndpratas> drewboardman: Use docker compose. --link is already deprecated I believe. They will be always linked when joined to the same network
3 [2017-12-21T17:58:40] <ndpratas> inside tester if you ping "webapp" it will resolve the dns to the ip address
4 [2017-12-21T17:58:59] <ndpratas> (if they are in the same network which they will in compose)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T17:01:12] <rightisleft> in docker swarm - what methodology does the mesh network use when load balancing? I know you can turn on DNS-Round-Robin, but whats the order of operations ?
2 [2017-12-21T17:01:45] <rightisleft> IE if service: fish has a replica count of 10 on an overlay network - how does docker discern which instance to send data to?

1 [2017-12-21T17:42:42] <ldacey> What is the simplest set up to remotely deploy some ETL / reporting stuff on a windows machine? 1) PostgreSQL image with the tables created, 2) Python image (maybe Airflow) to run scripts, 3) a volume for raw files or scripts to be saved?
2 [2017-12-21T17:43:48] <ldacey> This all needs to be a self contained thing operating on a single computer, and I want to avoid installing much software (other than docker for windows)
3 [2017-12-21T17:46:47] <ndpratas> rightisleft: I believe you can't choose order: [<-LINK->]
4 [2017-12-21T17:49:40] <ndpratas> unless you use DNSRR and leave it to the client to choose one of many dns query results

1 [2017-12-21T17:50:51] <drewboardman> Hi. So I have 2 containers running on a VM. One is a web app on port 9000. The other is atestercontainer that needs to hit localhost:9000 to visit the web app
2 [2017-12-21T17:51:00] <drewboardman> what's the smartest way to go about this?
3 [2017-12-21T17:51:27] <drewboardman> for the web app, I'm just doingdocker run -p 9000:9000 <etc> <etc>
4 [2017-12-21T17:51:45] <drewboardman> but I'm having network errors trying to request it from thetestercontainer
5 [2017-12-21T17:57:40] <drewboardman> does--linkexist to do this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T18:05:13] <drewboardman> damn, i really would like to avoid writing a docker compose file
2 [2017-12-21T18:07:02] <drewboardman> i really need the output of docker logs
3 [2017-12-21T18:07:17] <drewboardman> and the web app needs to be running before the CMD of the tester is executed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T18:24:59] <ammario> Anyone know how to find the ZFS filesystem associated w/ a container? I'm using docker 1.13.1. In later versions of Docker there's a usefulGraphdriverfield when getting a container, but I can't upgrade for other compatibility reasons.
2 [2017-12-21T18:43:52] <ammario> Offering $10 PayPal/ETH to anyone that solve my problem :)
3 [2017-12-21T19:11:29] <ammario> Figured it out:/var/lib/docker/image/zfs/layerdb/mounts/<container-id>/mount-id
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T18:33:14] <drewboardman> ndpratas: do the containers actually need to be linked to achieve what I'm trying to do?
2 [2017-12-21T18:33:32] <drewboardman> essentially tester really just needs to know about port 9000 on host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-21T20:20:05] <SISheogorath> ndpratas: not only for compose. It's deprecated in general.
2 [2017-12-21T20:21:04] <SISheogorath> drewboardman: Why does it need to be localhost?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 [2017-12-22T00:35:35] <SISheogorath> use real--mountinstead of a wrong-sign
4 [2017-12-22T00:35:52] <SISheogorath> just write it again yourself instead of coping ;)@smashingx1
5 [2017-12-22T00:38:23] <smashingx1> copying you mean?
6 [2017-12-22T00:38:53] <smashingx1> heh. What I did is I constructed the command in notepad and then copy it to the command line, that was the problem
7 [2017-12-22T00:39:03] <smashingx1> thank you@SISheogorath
8 [2017-12-22T00:40:28] <smashingx1> would that be the translation of a non-swarm command like this: [<-CODE->]
9 [2017-12-22T00:40:51] <smashingx1> because it seems like swarm can't handle -v
10 [2017-12-22T00:46:26] <SISheogorath> Swarm can handle the mount command, but you have to handle the data
11 [2017-12-22T00:46:45] <SISheogorath> and yes, this should work
12 [2017-12-22T02:07:16] <SISheogorath> smashingx1: yes, check [<-LINK->]
13 [2017-12-22T12:28:24] <SISheogorath> jemliF: As far as I know some people do, but I wouldn't recommend it
14 [2017-12-22T14:05:15] <SISheogorath> AyushyaChitransh: It's because you put the parameters behind the image name
15 [2017-12-22T14:07:06] <AyushyaChitransh> My goodness! What a silly mistake! thanks a lot@SISheogorathI wouldn't have been able to figure this out. Its working fine now
16 [2017-12-22T14:07:26] <SISheogorath> This way they are send as arg to the process inside the image. You need to put them before the image name so they are processed by docker
17 [2017-12-22T14:07:39] <SISheogorath> AyushyaChitransh: You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T00:57:01] <smashingx1> and also, can I mount it from another server? e.g. nfs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T09:19:57] <ndpratas> @drewboardman You can always publish the port on the host with -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> and from there on, you can access the webapp on the <dockerHostIP>:<hostPort>.i really need the output of docker logs [<-CODE->] and the web app needs to be running before the CMD of the tester is executedThis is exactly why you need compose. You can use depends_on flag in docker compose file in order to set dependencies. Docker will make sure to initiate your container in order. It's pretty cool actually.

1 [2017-12-22T09:22:32] <jemliF> is it possible to launch an android emulator from docker container?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T13:41:15] <AyushyaChitransh> Hello, a question here: [<-CODE->]
2 [2017-12-22T13:42:10] <AyushyaChitransh> there is a server running on port3000which I verified by going inside container and usingcurl localhost:3000
3 [2017-12-22T14:02:04] <AyushyaChitransh> If I specify these ports in a docker-compose file, everything works well, but when starting container  alone, I think ports are not being forwarded

1 [2017-12-22T14:54:00] <akkayatr> Hi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T18:09:51] <ldacey> So it is preferred to use a volume compared to linking a host folder? This volume would contain and persist the raw data files, for example, which I download from an SFTP site?
2 [2017-12-22T18:10:36] <ldacey> I don’t want to lose the raw data, they will be downloaded to this location, then processed by a python container, then loaded into PostgreSQL container
3 [2017-12-23T01:23:05] <ldacey> SISheogorath: thanks. So in this case, management wants everything to work in a silo (separate database and reporting all on-premise and not a part of our data warehouse). I actually would prefer that the files remained on the host machine as a normal folder which my python ETL stuff could read and write to
4 [2017-12-23T01:24:01] <ldacey> This would be a windows pro machine, so I’d just have a folder on it which is linked to the container?
5 [2017-12-23T05:05:27] <ldacey> Got it. Mounted my dags folder (python ETL scripts) and a folder for files and it worked just fine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T18:59:15] <SISheogorath> ldacey: It highly depends on the size of your setup. I would go myself for host directories, but the main reason is that it's easier to control and Backup when you run on a single host. When you run a Storage backend or an orchestrator you probably don't want to manage tons of directories across all hosts and that's where volumes are what you really love. Also when you go for a setup on AWS, Azure, or GCE. They have nicely integrated volume drivers that makes it way easier to manage volumes instead of syncing host directories between your machines
2 [2017-12-23T19:23:52] <SISheogorath> truthadjustr: it highly depends on what you are doing. For hosting K8s CoreOS is pretty good. For docker swarm or minimal docker setups in general linuxkit is the way to go. For single or a few boxes using a usual OS is way easier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T19:28:35] <andersonkyle> I'm curious if anyone knows the ETA for Kubernetes support within Docker CE/EE?  And if there's a good issue in GitHub to watch for this feature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-22T21:27:39] <smashingx1> what would be the ip address of a container in a swarm using the Overlay Network Driver?
2 [2017-12-22T21:27:56] <smashingx1> would that be the ip inside of "docker inspect"?
3 [2017-12-22T23:18:54] <SISheogorath> smashingx1: yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-23T08:42:30] <truthadjustr> is coreos the best docker platform?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-23T16:55:16] <markych96> i prefered rancheros
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-24T03:20:49] <smashingx1> Now that I connected my swarm node to the overlay network I lost connectivity to it if I want to connect from another host, even though I'm exposing the ports by doing -p 5432:5432
2 [2017-12-24T03:21:16] <smashingx1> This is how I created the service:

3 [2017-12-25T23:47:41] <briantopping> Curious if anyone is using IntelliJ GoLand to work with Docker sources. I’m new to both (and GoLand looks to be pretty new), thought there might be some collected knowledge I could discover...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-26T00:55:53] <ldacey> I have been running into permission issues with Docker for Windows using the postgres official image. My docker containers are linux though
2 [2017-12-26T00:56:15] <ldacey> I am trying to link the PGDATA folder to a normal folder I can view and edit
3 [2017-12-26T00:56:40] <ldacey> I have this working with my airflow python ETL scripts etc, but the PGDATA folder won't play nice
4 [2017-12-26T00:58:09] <ldacey> this is for a single machine and there is no need for data to be accessible elsewhere, so a host folder made sense compared to making a volume beforehand

1 [2017-12-26T12:49:28] <ldacey> Has anyone tried to deploy some containers to a computer they don’t have direct or constant access to?
2 [2017-12-26T12:51:53] <ldacey> As an alternative to traveling there and setting up some pretty simple automated reporting (Salesforce and ftp files), I was considering just having Docker installed on a computer and running a few containers
3 [2017-12-26T12:53:39] <ldacey> I’d need to set it up through screen sharing tools or have someone set it up for me. Any changes I would make would have to be through the docker or compose files

1 [2017-12-26T13:08:27] <gorbierd> Hello all! I know it's probably a bit out of topic, but I'm trying to automate build and run of the java app with docker. I'm using docker-compose with depends_on directive for tomcat server, which depends on maven build container. The problem is, that web doesn't wait until maven package the app, just until it started. Any idea of how can I automate such pipline with a single docker-compose file?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-26T14:09:32] <SISheogorath> ldacey: check watchtower for docker. It automatically updates the containers when there is a new image available. I used it for CD purposes without the need of ssh into the machine. Works pretty well^^
2 [2017-12-26T14:10:48] <SISheogorath> gorbierd: why docker compose? Use a multi-staged build for that is way more effective. Other wise search for the builder-pattern in context of docker for similar set-ups
3 [2017-12-26T14:11:33] <SISheogorath> elcolie: sounds a bit more like a gitlab than an docker issue
4 [2017-12-26T14:12:08] <elcolie> SISheogorath: I found the solution now. Yeah you are right. It isGitlab-CI runner behavior
5 [2017-12-26T14:14:08] <SISheogorath> smashingx1: did you check your postgres instance is running correctly?
6 [2017-12-26T14:14:33] <elcolie> SISheogorath: Thank you :)
7 [2017-12-26T16:06:31] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: is running
8 [2017-12-26T16:48:13] <SISheogorath> imaia: for sure, but I never made it to hit that limit. And as there are tons of running instances out there and I never saw someone complaining, I think it's high enough to don't worry about it
9 [2017-12-26T16:48:54] <SISheogorath> smashingx1: so postgres is running but you can't connect from outside?
10 [2017-12-26T17:09:30] <smashingx1> SISheogorath: No when I connect it to an overlay network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-26T14:40:51] <imaia> does docker have a maximum number of networks?

3 [2017-12-29T09:41:32] <przemolb> SISheogorath: why do you prefer to use bind mount ? I am assuming this is based on your personal experience. So what made you to use bind mount ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-28T16:23:15] <yosefrow> przemolb: Yes via volume bind mount for live files or Dockerfile COPY for files that live in the container only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-12-28T16:43:54] <SISheogorath> The best practice is to provide configuration for your application by environment variables (if possible) and save your persistent data in volumes.
2 [2017-12-28T16:44:15] <SISheogorath> But I personally prefer to bind mount most things outside

2 [2017-12-29T11:47:28] <SISheogorath> For setup on AWS, Azure or GCE I would recommend to use volumes
3 [2017-12-29T11:49:06] <SISheogorath> elcolie: to be honest I wouldn't use their setup .-.

5 [2017-12-29T11:49:55] <SISheogorath> Check the official docker images and develop it using them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-02T13:50:51] <SISheogorath> dpnashsh: Docker is an container engine (means it isolates applications) and orchestration system (means it places applications on various hosts and makes sure there is a fail over when a host dies). It provides all tooling to create such containers. Means you can download images of applications and/or build them yourself in a reproducable way using Dockerfiles. This way docker allows you to manage the entire workflow of a application building to deployment.

1 [2018-01-02T14:05:32] <briantopping> dpnashsh: another way to look at Docker is that of library and deployment isolation. Linux package managers do a good job of avoiding system bit rot by making sure installed libraries are compatible, but they can get stuck. Docker images encapsulate these libraries are isolated to the specific deployment that needs them so the host is not overloaded with installations for every service on the machine.
2 [2018-01-02T14:08:52] <briantopping> Natively, Docker is not a virtualization environment, it's an encapsulation environment like chroot once was. It uses cgroups, which are a more powerful version of that.
3 [2018-01-02T14:10:21] <briantopping> That said, running Docker containers on non-Linux OSes generally requires emulation of a Linux environment with lightweight virtualization running behind the scenes.
4 [2018-01-02T14:13:23] <briantopping> Does that make sense?
5 [2018-01-02T14:16:31] <jemliF> SISheogorath: thank you, I will try it
6 [2018-01-02T14:17:40] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I am facing acontainer exited with code 0with docker compose
7 [2018-01-02T14:17:43] <SISheogorath> briantopping: for Windows containers that's not 100% correct :D
8 [2018-01-02T14:17:59] <SISheogorath> jemliF: well, what does the logs say?
9 [2018-01-02T14:18:35] <briantopping> SISheogorath: please do feel free to correct that!
10 [2018-01-02T14:18:51] <jemliF> SISheogorath: it printsdockerizedmfp_devbox_1 exited with code 0
11 [2018-01-02T14:18:55] <jemliF> nothing else
12 [2018-01-02T14:19:23] <jemliF> It's weird because I am able to build and run my container separately
13 [2018-01-02T14:19:44] <briantopping> SISheogorath: oh you mean for containers that have Windows contents, yes?
14 [2018-01-02T14:21:34] <SISheogorath> briantopping: exactly. Can't say much about that myself because I got rid of Windows a while ago
15 [2018-01-02T14:21:36] <briantopping> I did think of that briefly but decided against polluting the explanation for someone just getting started
16 [2018-01-02T14:21:50] <jemliF> SISheogorath: here is myDockerfile [<-LINK->]
17 [2018-01-02T14:21:51] <SISheogorath> Completely fine with that ^^
18 [2018-01-02T14:22:07] <briantopping> I feel sorry for anyone that needs to run Windows in a server room.
19 [2018-01-02T14:23:00] <jemliF> briantopping: me too
20 [2018-01-02T14:23:03] <SISheogorath> briantopping:  Same over here :D
21 [2018-01-02T14:23:28] <SISheogorath> jemliF: Looks fine. How do you start your container?
22 [2018-01-02T14:23:52] <jemliF> sudo docker-compose up
23 [2018-01-02T14:24:01] <SISheogorath> that explains it :D
24 [2018-01-02T14:24:31] <jemliF> SISheogorath: what's wrong?
25 [2018-01-02T14:24:42] <SISheogorath> you call bash as entrypoint and CMD which is pointless, but let's get to the real problem: bash itself doesn't get any instruction and doesn't run interactively. So it exists with 0
26 [2018-01-02T14:25:32] <SISheogorath> so you either call your container with the application you really want to run or you run it interactively and open the program you need with the shell itself
27 [2018-01-02T14:25:51] <SISheogorath> the latter doesn't work with docker-compose
28 [2018-01-02T14:25:54] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I notice that so I added theseENTRYPOINTandCMDin Dockerfile
29 [2018-01-02T14:26:00] <SISheogorath> at least not without a bit hacking :D
30 [2018-01-02T14:27:15] <jemliF> SISheogorath: I don't have a specific program to run on startup
31 [2018-01-02T14:27:29] <jemliF> how can I keep my container up and running?
32 [2018-01-02T14:28:14] <SISheogorath> there are various ways. Pretty popular is to justtail -f /dev/nulland then jump into it usingdocker exec
33 [2018-01-02T14:29:13] <jemliF> SISheogorath: where to put thistail -f /dev/null?
34 [2018-01-02T14:31:45] <SISheogorath> simplest way is to remove the entrypoint and use it as CMD
35 [2018-01-02T14:32:10] <SISheogorath> not completely sure for the java image, but I guess it should work
36 [2018-01-02T14:37:23] <jemliF> SISheogorath: apparently it's working
37 [2018-01-02T14:37:40] <SISheogorath> you're welcome :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-03T04:30:36] <SISheogorath> elcolie: keep in mind that the php image doesn't use the packaged version of php
2 [2018-01-03T04:33:14] <SISheogorath> I just wanted to mention that because you may run into a problem like: Mhm, why is php twice in that image
3 [2018-01-03T04:34:11] <SISheogorath> When the driver depends on the php package and the php package is not installed by default… I guess you understand ^^
4 [2018-01-03T04:35:14] <SISheogorath> Maybe check the "add more extensions" section [<-LINK->]
5 [2018-01-03T04:35:27] <SISheogorath> If that doesn't work, then maybe
6 [2018-01-03T04:35:48] <SISheogorath> And you should maybe usephp:5-apache
7 [2018-01-03T04:36:42] <elcolie> SISheogorath: OK. One moment.
8 [2018-01-03T04:37:13] <elcolie> Let me try5.6-apache

10 [2018-01-03T04:39:00] <elcolie>  [<-CODE->]
11 [2018-01-03T04:39:11] <elcolie> I will try adding repo to it
12 [2018-01-03T04:39:50] <SISheogorath> As mentioned, follow the instructions for extending the image, not blindly use package management. It'll fool you in this case
13 [2018-01-03T04:40:51] <SISheogorath> Since it'll install a php version you don't want
14 [2018-01-03T04:41:58] <elcolie> SISheogorath: Opss. Sorry. Forgot

1 [2018-01-03T08:20:45] <SISheogorath> check how the container exited
2 [2018-01-03T08:21:40] <SISheogorath> when it's 127 (or 128?) then you have to check where the binary is. Otherwise I suggest to exec into the container and start a regular debugging
3 [2018-01-03T08:22:34] <SISheogorath> and by exec into the contianer I mean doing something likedocker run <your parameters> -it --entrypoint /bin/bash <yourimage>and then run your commands manually with debug flags etc

3 [2018-01-03T09:21:04] <safiulm_twitter> Can you do docker logs container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-03T09:32:24] <SISheogorath> elcolie: that's exactly why people shouldn't use packages in docker images. The container exits when the process with PID 1 exits. Which is in this case an init script which exists after doing a double fork to demonize apache… Check: [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-01-03T09:33:52] <SISheogorath> So you not only don't really make it to start the httpd, you also happily create a lot of little zombie processes on your system in worst case
3 [2018-01-03T09:37:44] <SISheogorath> If you really want to use the packaged version you should at least copy the apache foreground script and run it as entrypoint

1 [2018-01-04T18:40:42] <shahbazn> If i am building FROM a base docker image and that base image starts an nginx process with its entrypoint script. Now I add an entrypoint script to fill a few config files from env variables and before the base image calls its entrypoint script. So my question does adding a new entrypoint script override the base image's entrypoint script or does it add another layer on the docker image and execute both layer first the new layer and then base images?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-07T06:55:54] <smashingx1> So I just debugged the problem I have in my docker swarm. My swarm consists of a manager node and a worker node. I created my first service inside of my overlay network (called mynetwork) and constrained on the manager node. Then, I created another service that all it does is to ping the service in the manager node, so I constrained it in the worker node and also joined to the overlay network. The problem I have is the following, when I ping the service in the manager node from the worker node I get the following:helloworld.1.r5i6truptf61@swarm02    | ping: bad address 'dev_db'and when I ping the service from the manager node (so the same node as the service I'm trying to ping I don't get any errors)helloworld.1.bcay6ht12bs8@swarm02    | 64 bytes from 10.0.0.4: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.027 ms
2 [2018-01-07T07:01:58] <smashingx1> I thought at first it could be the firewall the problem so what I did is to flush iptables in both hosts
3 [2018-01-07T07:02:03] <smashingx1> but still nothing
4 [2018-01-07T07:06:20] <smashingx1> nevermind, I just restarted the service in both hosts and now it works.
5 [2018-01-07T07:06:33] <smashingx1> I think there's a bug with docker overlay network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-07T14:54:53] <JohnyWaynen_twitter> Hello, very quick question: is docker handling service healt inside container. For example do i need to setup a systemd script inside container for the health of service ?
2 [2018-01-07T21:34:17] <JohnyWaynen_twitter> Thanks Frederik, obviously first time I hear kubernetes, will look at. Systemd look necessity for the purpose. Since I had run 8-9 months of nonstop containers never faced with a process stop issue, but it pinned to my head nowadays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-07T20:42:24] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> JohnyWaynen_twitter: If you want container health / orchestration you can add kubernetes on top of your docker these two work perfectly in sync with each other
2 [2018-01-07T20:43:03] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> You would need to add some kind of health check inside your container that kubernetes can react upon
3 [2018-01-07T22:36:43] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> It depends on what your container cotains, but Systemd is defiantly one road you can take
4 [2018-01-07T22:37:35] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> if its a web or a java application with Spring Boot there is web interface you can use to do health checks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-07T22:43:03] <jamesalbert> Not sure if this is the right place to ask docker-py questions, but I'm using python to pull, run a detached container of, and run 1 command on a python:3.6 image. It pulls and runs the image, but when trying to run the command with: [<-CODE->] it just logs the default python prompt. I'm assuming this has something to do with the default entrypoint, but I tried overriding it and still no luck. Would anyone know by looking at this what I'm doing wrong?
2 [2018-01-07T22:45:19] <jamesalbert> For more info, I'm trying to run the equivalent:docker exec -t <container> pip install -r requirements.txt
3 [2018-01-07T22:45:43] <jamesalbert> but all I'm seeing in logs (ran from python) is: [<-CODE->]
4 [2018-01-07T22:46:04] <jamesalbert> but it works as expected on the command line, just not in python

1 [2018-01-08T03:40:53] <6ewis> hi
2 [2018-01-08T03:41:29] <6ewis> why does docker suggest to do this: eval "$(docker-machine env default)" as opposed to only docker-machine env default
3 [2018-01-08T03:41:34] <6ewis> what is the difference?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 [2018-01-08T08:59:20] <comeUpWithItLater> what can we do in this case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-08T09:24:22] <ethicalmohit> Guys, I just want to know about the behaviour of the docker container when any of the app running inside the container stops.
2 [2018-01-08T09:25:29] <ethicalmohit> I have monitored my one of the nodejs app which is running on docker container which stop responding after sometime due to the worker died inside container but the container doesn't stops.
3 [2018-01-08T09:25:47] <ethicalmohit> I want to know if its the normal behaviour or is there anything i have to look upon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-08T16:05:31] <6ewis> this channel is so active it's amazing
2 [2018-01-08T16:05:38] <6ewis> I love the conversation we're having
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-08T17:01:51] <yosefrow> 6ewis: man eval
2 [2018-01-08T17:02:26] <yosefrow> Eval evaluates some text and excecutes it
3 [2018-01-08T17:02:51] <yosefrow> Dollar parentheses does that too
4 [2018-01-08T17:05:36] <yosefrow> So ur command says evaluate the output of  the evaluated command
5 [2018-01-08T17:07:01] <yosefrow> Try 'docker-machine env default'
6 [2018-01-08T17:07:15] <yosefrow> And observe the output
7 [2018-01-08T17:07:48] <yosefrow> That output is then evaluated w eval
8 [2018-01-08T18:36:45] <6ewis> yosefrow: exactly so why is it recomman ded
9 [2018-01-08T18:36:52] <6ewis> doesnt make sense to me
10 [2018-01-08T18:40:36] <yosefrow> .docker-machine env default. alone outputs commands as text. It doesnt run them. Try it  . Eval takes that output and runs it
11 [2018-01-08T18:40:48] <yosefrow> 6ewis:
12 [2018-01-08T18:42:01] <6ewis> thanjs yosefrow
13 [2018-01-08T18:42:21] <6ewis> so in theory i could have done eval(eval(docker-machine..))
14 [2018-01-08T18:42:24] <yosefrow> ethicalmohit: docker containers require a running process to live. When there are no processes left in a container it exits
15 [2018-01-08T18:43:04] <yosefrow> Run ps waux inside the container 2 see processes inside it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-09T08:49:28] <ethicalmohit> yosefrow: Thank you for your response. Yes, It was weird. In the logs I can see that the worker was died but there were some SQL queries running inside the container. I got to know about this by docker logs. I haven't seen if the node process is running inside the container or not. As It was under production so I didn't get the chance to dig deep.  I will check it next time.

My company has self-signed certs, so we used to add corporate certs to the docker daemon's store by attaching to a screen session and appending certs to the store... I find that this isn't possible anymore.

1 [2018-01-14T23:06:42] <fayep> Is there any chance that version tags will see a resurgence under moby/moby?
2 [2018-01-14T23:08:53] <fayep> Right now if you build, you can't run on a 17.12 docker server (latest release) because the API has been bumped to 1.36 which is newer than the 1.35 supported by the docker server without either a) going back to find the Bump API version commit and reverting to the previous commit or b) lying to the server and telling it you're using an older client.
3 [2018-01-14T23:09:30] <fayep> normally you'd just checkout v1.35 or 17.12 or whatever and be done, but version tags haven't been maintained since 17.05

1 [2018-01-15T14:14:23] <bjornamr> Is there any easy solution to split up a build in docker?I want to be able to build something. Then reference that build into another DockerFile to build the rest of the solution
2 [2018-01-15T14:17:18] <bjornamr> The problem is that I do not want to do pip install -r requirements for the python part every time I build.
3 [2018-01-15T14:21:58] <bjornamr> So the Ideal would be that I would end up with two DockerFiles. The first one to install dependecies and the other file to reference the image from made from the first dockerfile.

1 [2018-01-16T05:36:08] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: build an own image for your cronjob and run it as a separate task. Keep in mind it's an unperfect solution because the container may dies before the job was running and comes up again after the job should have run which results in missing the cronjob being done once. If you are using CoreOS/ContainerLinux they have an distributed systemd build in, which is probably capable of doing systemd.timers as well

1 [2018-01-18T22:32:08] <rmagnum2002> Hi everyone, new to docker, when running docker build . it fails at this step [<-CODE->] where exactly this path should be created? not on my computer I assume
2 [2018-01-19T09:46:50] <rmagnum2002> SISheogorath: thank you, found the issue, there was indeed a missing folder and files in it required
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-19T06:28:43] <SISheogorath> rmagnum2002: when you rundocker build .(maybe with more parameter) the entire content of the directory represented in the last argument is sent to the docker service which that again places this directory structure in this tmp dir. depending on where you dockerd (docker service) runs, it's placed there. And it looks like there is a file missing in your directory.
2 [2018-01-19T08:16:19] <SISheogorath> claudio-viola: well, what does your syslog say?
3 [2018-01-19T09:14:54] <SISheogorath> well, you configured your container to use syslog. syslog is not docker.log
4 [2018-01-19T13:54:33] <SISheogorath> rmagnum2002: You're welcome

1 [2018-01-21T21:33:05] <mberndt123> I\'m running an application I\'ve written in a docker container. It listens on 9000/tcp and 9011/tcp. When I run it withdocker run -p9000:9000 -p9011:9011, it starts fine and I can connect and communicate through port 9000. However it doesn\'t work with port 9011, I keep getting "Connection reset by peer."
2 [2018-01-21T21:36:21] <mberndt123> Same if I map it onto another port, like-p 1234:9011

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-23T22:45:29] <yosefrow> mikki pls be specific. where do u want env to come from and where do u want it to go
2 [2018-01-23T22:47:00] <yosefrow> to inside container?
3 [2018-01-23T22:47:45] <kobvel> yes, inside of the nested Dockerfile
4 [2018-01-23T22:47:48] <kobvel> forwalletnode
5 [2018-01-23T22:47:57] <kobvel> I am running a script
6 [2018-01-23T22:47:59] <kobvel>  [<-LINK->]
7 [2018-01-23T22:48:18] <kobvel> which relies on theprocess.env.PEERSvariable
8 [2018-01-23T22:48:23] <kobvel> which is undefined for some reason
9 [2018-01-23T22:48:41] <yosefrow> use docker compose environment or env_file
10 [2018-01-23T22:49:06] <kobvel> I do use environment
11 [2018-01-23T22:49:11] <yosefrow> or in Dockerfile use ENV
12 [2018-01-23T22:49:17] <yosefrow> your choice
13 [2018-01-23T22:49:25] <kobvel> environment does not work
14 [2018-01-23T22:49:33] <kobvel> what was the last option?
15 [2018-01-23T22:49:38] <kobvel> ENV?
16 [2018-01-23T22:49:50] <yosefrow> docker compose environment does work
17 [2018-01-23T22:50:18] <yosefrow> if its not working 4 u it may be misconfigured
18 [2018-01-23T22:50:46] <yosefrow> ENV in Dockerfile makes it part of the image
19 [2018-01-23T22:51:19] <yosefrow> it will then appear in any container run from that image
20 [2018-01-23T22:51:56] <kobvel> environment works for my server nodes, but not during the run of the Dockerfile
21 [2018-01-23T22:52:00] <yosefrow> docker compose environment adds it after container already running
22 [2018-01-23T22:52:08] <kobvel> aaaa
23 [2018-01-23T22:52:10] <kobvel> I see
24 [2018-01-23T22:52:14] <yosefrow> I mean at run time
25 [2018-01-23T22:52:39] <kobvel> that is an answer
26 [2018-01-23T22:53:01] <yosefrow> choose a method that is best 4 u
27 [2018-01-23T22:53:04] <kobvel> so .env file should solve the issue probably
28 [2018-01-23T22:53:27] <yosefrow> .env file... not sure Dockerfile reads that
29 [2018-01-23T22:53:36] <yosefrow> haven't tried
30 [2018-01-23T22:53:49] <yosefrow> I know compose reads it
31 [2018-01-23T22:54:19] <kobvel> I will try
32 [2018-01-23T22:54:24] <kobvel> thank you very much
33 [2018-01-23T22:54:28] <kobvel> you made my day!
34 [2018-01-23T22:54:47] <yosefrow> worst case use dockerfile ARG
35 [2018-01-23T22:55:03] <yosefrow> to pass it at command line
36 [2018-01-23T22:55:09] <yosefrow> np
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-24T00:35:25] <ArStah> kobvel: you can use ARG as@yosefrowsaid, but you don't have to specify it only while launching via command line, you can use [<-LINK->] of yourdocker-composefile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-24T00:46:54] <kobvel> Is there a way to find a host address of the docker container inside of Applicaiton?
2 [2018-01-24T00:47:30] <kobvel> right now I am passing a DOCKER_HOST as an variable to the Node.js server, but I believe there should be a better way to do that
3 [2018-01-24T00:47:31] <kobvel> ArStah:
4 [2018-01-24T00:48:07] <ArStah> Really don't know
5 [2018-01-24T00:49:09] <ArStah> You can mount/etc/hostnamefrom host to container, for example
6 [2018-01-24T00:49:55] <ArStah> But you'll have it only after launch, not while build

1 [2018-01-24T12:29:05] <zigzagzoozoo_twitter> hi guys. can anyone help with this proxy problem? i\'m trying to build an image from a dockerfile, base image is node:9-alpine. in this file i run "npm install ..." and i get "FetchError: request to [<-LINK->] failed, reason: connect ECONNREFUSED 151.101.112.162:443". i have set the proxy for npm, and the proxy is also set in the env. if i specifiy the proxy in the Dockerfile in this manner: "ENV http_proxy= [<-LINK->] " the build completes succesfully. but i don\'t want to set the proxy for the conainer itself. so i tried to use call "docker build" command with the argument "--build-arg HTTP_PROXY= [<-LINK->] " but sadly this does not work and i get the ECONNREFUSED error described above. any ideas on this? or is it npm specific?

I'd like syslog-ng to be able to stitch those chunks back together, but it seems like docker is just taking my original string, and splitting it with indistinguishable\\ns before shipping it off to my syslog-ng service.

1 [2018-01-26T17:12:23] <cuznerdexter> Hi anyone, how do you save karma junit xml file in a docker container and then report to jenkins?? I have tried over 300 times in jenkins pipeline and always no xml file found!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-26T19:40:48] <hullsean> cuznerdexter: Are you sure you've tested as the user jenkins runs as?  I would guess it is either writing to the wrong path or doesn't have permissions on the path you specify.  Perhaps there is an error somewhere that jenkins has logged
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-27T05:53:56] <fouadroumieh> is it possible to set the interactive mode of a container inside dockerfile? This is not working CMD [ "-D", "FOREGROUND" ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-28T12:10:33] <AnorakTech_twitter> Hi there. I have a 2 docker containers running. Is it possible to move one image/container to another partition? I want to keep the first container in the default /var/lib/docker folder, but move the 2nd one to another place.
2 [2018-01-28T13:46:17] <AnorakTech_twitter> Cool, thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-28T12:57:49] <SISheogorath> fouadroumieh: no, but you can check the official apache image, they use a script for this. [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-01-28T12:59:32] <SISheogorath> AnorakTech_twitter: no. Container always run stateless in your docker directory which is when you don't do fundamental changes in/var/lib/docker. What you can change is the location of your volumes. But only when you use bind mounts or a non-default volume driver
3 [2018-01-30T10:34:19] <SISheogorath> outkaj: you shouldn't need to backup the container itself. Only the volumes. There it highly depends on your filesystem underneath. If you go for a storage system, snapshot the filesystem but make sure you don't have some caching in-between as NFS does. If you run on a local filesystem or a NAS you sadly have to stop the container, make a copy, start it again. At least when you want it reliable. If you have less stateful data you can also copy it on the fly, but it's risky. Given the luck that you run btrfs or zfs underneath you can also simply use their snapshot featues.
4 [2018-01-30T10:35:24] <SISheogorath> elbsurfer: keep in mind that docker searches space in /var/lib/docker not in the location you run the command
5 [2018-01-30T10:36:45] <SISheogorath> comeUpWithItLater: keep in mind there is maybe a firewall doing ugly things. Also this doesn't work when you run it on a VM that does NAT on the network device. Otherwise I have not really an idea .-.

1 [2018-01-30T01:49:19] <outkaj> Hello! What is the most straightforward method/utility to back up a running container with its volume directory? (I'd like to avoid something like:docker commit, create an intermediate container, copy the volume into the intermediate container and tar it, untar it into the committed version, etc, if possible), as I have to do this a number of times.
2 [2018-01-30T16:39:28] <outkaj> SISheogorath: thank you for the thorough answer! that is very helpful and it makes sense re: needing to stop the container, as well.

1 [2018-01-30T22:19:11] <cuznerdexter> hullsean: Thanks for the advice. You were correct, ultimately it was to do with wrong paths being interpreted. Finally I got the karma tests passed back to Jenkins and reporting. Took me 395 attempts though!
2 [2018-01-30T22:27:04] <cuznerdexter> hullsean: Maybe you can advise -  What is best way to run a ci/cd pipeline with docker and jenkins pipeline?We want to run the tests in the dev code, then if they pass we build the prod code and deploy nginx prod server. I tried a docker multi build - seems like wrong approach. Maybe docker compose is better?

7 [2018-01-31T08:38:17] <cuznerdexter> yosefrow: Thanks for the great advice. Gitlab-ci sounds good.  All our pipelines are currently using Jenkins (in mind to move to Kubernetes). For now I have to find a solution using Docker ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-31T05:06:39] <yosefrow> cuznerdexter: your workflow seems perfect for gitlab-ci rather than jenkins
2 [2018-01-31T05:09:11] <yosefrow> cuznerdexter: for development/manual testing docker compose overrides/templates is a decent approach. it lets you override a base docker compose template with other env specific templates
3 [2018-01-31T05:10:19] <yosefrow> for true ci and unique env id go ultimately with kubernetes in addition to gitlab ci which I mentioned before. but there's a learning curve

1 [2018-01-31T11:46:29] <felps> good day to all...May I join in and ask for some assistance? I am running a docker swarm and having this strange issue.Adding a network to a service will stop it from coming up and be stuck at "starting". Anyone have any idea on how to tackle this issue?
2 [2018-01-31T12:17:40] <felps> cs-mahmoud-khateeb: why would you do that?
3 [2018-01-31T12:18:02] <felps> the container already "inherits
4 [2018-01-31T12:18:13] <felps> " the resolv.conf file from the host
5 [2018-01-31T12:18:44] <felps> so, pretty much, any address the host can resolve the container could also no?
6 [2018-01-31T12:34:42] <felps> @cs-mahmoud-khateeb I believe you can set the IP for the dns in the daemon.json (so, in your local docker daemon) instead of setting it in the container itself.It may not be as clean as you would hope but at least it keeps matter separated.https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/custom-docker0/
7 [2018-01-31T12:35:18] <felps> then you can set the dns to be whatever the host's IP is
8 [2018-01-31T12:36:48] <cs-mahmoud-khateeb> I have thought about this, it's a bit messy if you have an ecs cluster with multiple ec2 instances each running its own instance of service discovery which is acting as a dns.
9 [2018-01-31T12:38:15] <felps> I do believe, however, that the IP you are using will be fine for the foreseeable future
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-01-31T12:03:00] <cs-mahmoud-khateeb> is there a way to let a container (in bridge mode) use the host for dns queries without hardcoding the host ip address within the container ?
2 [2018-01-31T12:31:21] <cs-mahmoud-khateeb> felps: it doesn't work if the host's resolver lives on the hosts itself (in case of having a discovery service for example). I am using172.17.0.1but I feel it's a hack that will give me headache down the road.

4 [2018-01-31T12:28:30] <DaniGuardiola> however, it ignores.jsfiles in directories (in my case,src/)
5 [2018-01-31T12:28:46] <DaniGuardiola> if I add!src/*.jsit works

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-01T09:58:46] <brettminnie> @brettminnie But the bad container, there's the data I need.@zshzj that's why you start it up using the overridden entry point, if you use the shell it doesn't run any of the init scripts so you can change the config in there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-01T16:30:53] <PabloReszczynski> I have a docker question:Context: At work, we manage a whole lot of kiosks computers in our client locations. These kiosks are running docker containers with our software using docker-compose.The problem: In some situations, it is necessary to reset the system by usingdocker-compose downanddocker-compose up -d. But that requires sshing to the computer and doing the commands by hand, and some clients don’t even have ssh enabled. The numbers of kiosks we are managing are increasing each week and this kind of manual work is becoming too  much.

1 [2018-02-02T06:36:46] <hullsean> hey guys what is the best way to troubleshoot localhost networking problems? i have a local mysql instance (non docker) and a webserver i want to talk to it. but it’s not seeing outside itself. i’m a beginner at troubleshooting these
2 [2018-02-02T06:36:56] <hullsean> use interactive mode?
3 [2018-02-02T06:37:28] <lygoods> yes
4 [2018-02-02T06:37:38] <lygoods> docker -it mysql bash
5 [2018-02-02T06:37:47] <lygoods> docker exec -it mysql bash
6 [2018-02-02T06:37:51] <hullsean> docker inspect | grep IPAddress?
7 [2018-02-02T06:37:52] <lygoods> like this
8 [2018-02-02T06:38:13] <hullsean> the mysql instance is outside
9 [2018-02-02T06:38:23] <hullsean> it’s just running on mac
10 [2018-02-02T06:38:43] <lygoods> on my MAC
11 [2018-02-02T06:39:04] <lygoods> "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
12 [2018-02-02T06:39:10] <lygoods> docker ip
13 [2018-02-02T06:40:21] <hullsean> in the apache container i tried mysql -h localhost -u but it fails
14 [2018-02-02T06:40:42] <hullsean> i think i also started mysql with —skip-networking
15 [2018-02-02T06:41:50] <lygoods> ah
16 [2018-02-02T06:41:53] <hullsean> so appears i can reach out of the container
17 [2018-02-02T06:42:45] <lygoods> I try to visit from local to docker
18 [2018-02-02T06:42:46] <lygoods> ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on '172.17.0.2' (60)
19 [2018-02-02T06:42:49] <lygoods> Show this
20 [2018-02-02T06:42:54] <hullsean> i looked through the docker settings dialog & tabs but only thing i found was a subnet
21 [2018-02-02T06:43:15] <hullsean> yep
22 [2018-02-02T06:43:21] <hullsean> looks like the error
23 [2018-02-02T06:43:27] <lygoods> yes
24 [2018-02-02T06:43:40] <lygoods> I don’t know how to fix
25 [2018-02-02T06:43:44] <lygoods> Like this
26 [2018-02-02T06:44:01] <hullsean> would it be better if i out mysql into its own container bc then it would be on 172.17 network
27 [2018-02-02T06:44:11] <hullsean> ok
28 [2018-02-02T06:44:20] <hullsean> networking always gets messy !
29 [2018-02-02T06:44:55] <lygoods> ah
30 [2018-02-02T07:49:01] <hullsean> i have not tried
31 [2018-02-02T07:49:14] <hullsean> should be like any other service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-03T23:15:35] <yosefrow> maybe ps and sort by created by date or use docker-compose to manage name or specify --name on docker run command

1 [2018-02-05T05:21:39] <cheshirecode> are there alot of unfortunate people developing with Docker on Windows/Mac?
2 [2018-02-05T05:22:22] <ArStah> cheshirecode: me :c

4 [2018-02-05T05:30:36] <cheshirecode> struggled to get 2-way sync working with volumes, even in Linux VM for Docker on Windows
5 [2018-02-05T05:31:30] <ArStah> cheshirecode: that is working for me
6 [2018-02-05T05:31:34] <cheshirecode> ArStah: have you found a better way than [<-LINK->]
7 [2018-02-05T05:33:37] <cheshirecode> really? Did you get hot-reloading like Webpack HMR work too?
8 [2018-02-05T05:34:06] <ArStah> Don't think so, when i launched Docker container on my drive for the first time - windows asked me to share that drive, and after that almost all is working
9 [2018-02-05T05:34:29] <ArStah> No, hot-reloading, unfortunately, doesn't work
10 [2018-02-05T05:35:30] <ArStah> I've actually found a solution for it, hot-reloading is working, but it detect changes very-vey-very slowly

14 [2018-02-05T05:50:15] <cheshirecode> ah yes I went down that path
15 [2018-02-05T05:50:54] <cheshirecode> it's really slow as you mentioned, like a few seconds delay
16 [2018-02-05T05:53:38] <cheshirecode> according to [<-ISSUE->] , seems like a OS-level limitation on webpack-dev-server itself :)
17 [2018-02-05T06:02:34] <ArStah> I got used to it and while developing i launch it directly in Windows
18 [2018-02-05T07:45:19] <cheshirecode> I used to do it as well, for 1 application. Developing multiple inter-dependent applications is too much for Windows, it seems

1 [2018-02-05T09:53:33] <gaydenko> Hi! How to modify already existing container as if it was created with given--dnsoption?

1 [2018-02-06T06:31:34] <shadow-cpp> hello!
2 [2018-02-06T06:34:19] <jamesalbert> EHLO!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-06T08:12:29] <yosefrow> @gaydenko. -dns=IP_ADDRESS...Sets the IP addresses added as nameserver lines to the container's /etc/resolv.conf file. Processes in the container, when confronted with a hostname not in /etc/hosts, connect to these IP addresses on port 53 looking for name resolution services.
2 [2018-02-06T08:13:01] <yosefrow>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-02-06T08:15:06] <yosefrow> theoretically without dns option docker mounts host resolv.conf so host changes appear in container.  but with dns option not sure if host changes appear in container. so may just need to edit container resolv.conf manualky

1 [2018-02-06T10:05:51] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> Hey guys — is this the right place to make questions about Docker Official Images program?
2 [2018-02-06T12:58:09] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> SISheogorath: Basically I am the mainteiner of Express-Gateway and I would like to apply to be part of the Docker Official Images program. I’ve gone thorugh all the requirements but there’s one I am not sure about. I’d like to know where I should ask for clarifications.
3 [2018-02-06T13:40:19] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> So what I do not understand is whether it’s mandatory to have a separate repository just to store the Dockerfile definitions
4 [2018-02-06T13:40:31] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> express-gateway-docker-image
5 [2018-02-06T13:41:11] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> Or if I can have the “release” docker file within the same repository
6 [2018-02-06T14:30:08] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> SISheogorath:
7 [2018-02-06T14:40:15] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> SISheogorath: I am not sure I’m following you — what do you mean?
8 [2018-02-06T14:42:48] <SISheogorath> When you check official images, you\'ll notice they usually provide the few latest stable versions of a software like nextcloud or nginx, as well as traefik. (For example they provide a alpine-based version as well as a "raw" one).
9 [2018-02-06T14:44:34] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> Well the Official Docker Images are not generated using the source code — given it’s an npm package, I generate the docker image starting from there
10 [2018-02-06T14:44:40] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> I’ll probably open a PR and we’ll go from there.
11 [2018-02-06T14:55:02] <SISheogorath> That's a good idea :)
12 [2018-02-06T14:55:06] <SISheogorath> Let things envolve
13 [2018-02-06T14:55:13] <ghost~54e3435715522ed4b3dc1b7a> Thank you. Let’s see how it goes.
14 [2018-02-07T06:50:10] <SISheogorath> Well, I can't say much about Windows. Haven't used it for more than a year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-06T11:51:48] <SISheogorath> XVincentX: You mean in general or for a special image?

3 [2018-02-06T13:19:33] <SISheogorath> XVincentX: As alternative you can go checkout this place: [<-LINK->]
4 [2018-02-06T14:31:33] <SISheogorath> I would say you need it because you may want to support multiple releases with the docker setup
5 [2018-02-06T14:32:16] <SISheogorath> I can't think of an official image that doesn't run as separated repo

2 [2018-02-07T09:30:51] <Hobbit44> I had this set up before as i switched it back to port 4243 but i think they disabled the config file on windows in favour or the daemon config in the settings so they could run validation on the config (i think, just my experience)

1 [2018-02-08T18:08:35] <pedroparraortega> Hi all, i have a problem with my mac. I've installed docker for mac community edition (stable). And i've configured my configuration.json with bip:192.168.99.1/24 to avoid collaiding with my office network. The problem is that when i run a docker-compose up/down connected to the office network it takes too long. Finally its run but take too long. if i do the same connected to any other network it is pretty fast
2 [2018-02-08T18:08:43] <pedroparraortega> do you have any ideas??
3 [2018-02-08T20:18:18] <pedroparraortega> Try to leave the swarm before removing It
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-08T19:08:26] <fdisp> hello guys im trying to learn docker from online sources and at the moment there is a question i cant find an answer:can docker x64 (docker for debian x86-x64 in a 64 bit machine)RUNan image created from an ARM linux distro like raspbian, and vice-versa, could an arm architecture version of docker run an image created from a 64 bit linux distribution?
2 [2018-02-08T23:45:31] <fdisp> i found the answer to my question above. the docker image must originate from an os with the same cpu architecture as the host os and docker that is going to run it. an x64 bit pc where an x64 bit version of docker is required to be installed, can NOT run any ARM based docker image or vice-versa.important discovery:the docker’s slogan “build here and run everywhere” is a lie
3 [2018-02-08T23:59:03] <fdisp> SISheogorath: instead of sayingI wonder how you couldn't know this; you could have been more helpful if you answered when the question was asked, because as i stated before i am a complete noob in docker, and yes an incomplete information could be as bad as misleading
4 [2018-02-09T00:03:49] <SISheogorath> well, first of all, I wasn't online, when you asked it, and second of all, this knowledge is only far docker related
5 [2018-02-09T00:28:10] <SISheogorath> Well, I agree that it was maybe a bit ignorant to say this. Let's put it this way: Containers are not more than isolated places for processes on the same OS. So the same base rules apply to the processes inside a container, as the do outside. the main difference is that processes in containers are based on image, means they bring their own dependencies etc. with them. That means you don't have to care about the base OS's libs, setup, etc. All you need to care about is the kernel as this is the same for your application and the host. Kernel and of course everything below.
6 [2018-02-09T00:29:31] <SISheogorath> And for those who don't know: A docker image is a bit more complicated zip/tar file with multiple layers. Not more, not less. Just a zip/tar file for everything your container is made of. Means libs, configs, binaries, ….
7 [2018-02-09T00:39:02] <fdisp> thanks
8 [2018-02-09T01:18:30] <SISheogorath> dlpatri: not possible. Either bridge, or host network.
9 [2018-02-09T08:48:39] <SISheogorath> ajpatri: you can use the public hostname of your system which (may) works. But it also requires your database to be accessible outside of 127.0.0.1
10 [2018-02-09T08:48:52] <SISheogorath> As an alternative you can use a unix socket and mount it.
11 [2018-02-11T09:04:51] <SISheogorath> AshokRajuDevops: only one healthcheck line, but as long as you are capable of shell scripting, you should be able to run multiple healthchecks at once
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-08T19:10:29] <yosefrow> id be interested to know this as well. as far as I understand the hardware doesn't matter as long as you have the right os kernel
2 [2018-02-08T19:10:51] <yosefrow> so linux images on linux kernel
3 [2018-02-08T19:10:58] <yosefrow> but I'm not sure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-08T19:53:33] <oanapat> Hello everyone, I have a swarm set up which I used to learn how a swarm works, how machines are created and added to a swarm, etc. I want to delete that swarm and the machines in it but whenever I try to, I get the following errors:
2 [2018-02-08T19:53:43] <oanapat>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-02-08T19:54:09] <oanapat> the question: how do I delete a non active swarm, non active manager, worker nodes?
4 [2018-02-08T21:11:34] <oanapat> pedroparraortega: definetly an alternative but it did not work
5 [2018-02-08T21:12:26] <oanapat> found the solution (I am sure this is not the best one) went to my hyperv ->server manager and stopped all the machines from there manually, after that I was able to remobe all of them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-08T23:50:18] <SISheogorath> fdisp: .-. I wonder how you couldn't know this. It's basics of how compiling works when you work outside of a VM. Which you do on docker.
2 [2018-02-08T23:54:04] <SISheogorath> And it\'s not a lie, just incomplete. As you say to your child "When you are older, you can live everywhere" but don\'t include another planet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-09T00:20:16] <fdisp> i ask your pardon to everyone in this room. it was that my expectation based in the growing advertisement and rumor about docker was a little excessive. in the other hand expressions like “I wonder how you couldn't know this” can only yield a response of the same level of ignorance. thank you for understanding.

1 [2018-02-09T01:13:41] <dlpatri> I am working with docker compose, and I am trying to have one of my services be in the default docker compose bridge network as well as the host network. Having trouble finding anything in docs..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-09T01:20:21] <ajpatri> Hm, so containers in a bridge network can't leverage external resources? Like a database running outside of docker?

1 [2018-02-09T13:16:28] <hmrc87_twitter> Hi, any idea how to set prevent inter-container traffic from using the HTTP_PROXY of the host?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-09T13:52:57] <pedroparraortega> Just if any of you have the problem with docker-compose taking too long…. Adding a new entry inside the hosts file with127.0.0.1 localunixsocketsolved the issue

1 [2018-02-10T03:56:53] <ONE-Luffy> Hello world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-10T05:41:01] <AshokRajuDevops> hello all..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-10T05:42:00] <AshokRajuDevops> is there any way to check status codes(500,404) rather than simple command exit code (0,1) in docker health check commnad??
2 [2018-02-10T08:13:19] <AshokRajuDevops> FrederikBrinckTruelsen: i am using curl command to do health check.. curl --fail [<-LINK->] :<port>/<url> with time out of 5mins..  but problem is if deployment fails after 2mins, it will still checks status till timeout
3 [2018-02-10T08:14:36] <AshokRajuDevops> so is there any way to make container unhealthy if deployment fails before timeout??
4 [2018-02-10T08:14:45] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> Which webserver are you using?
5 [2018-02-10T08:15:03] <AshokRajuDevops> i am using tomcat appication server
6 [2018-02-10T08:27:24] <AshokRajuDevops> i am sure that docker is checking only exit codes of health check command  (0,1) to decide healthy or unhealthy.. curl command returns 1 while deploying and 1 if deployment fails and 0 if deployment success.
7 [2018-02-10T08:27:51] <AshokRajuDevops> so it is better  to do status check (400,501,500,200)
8 [2018-02-10T08:29:43] <AshokRajuDevops> if status code is 500,  container health check should be unhealthy immediately..
9 [2018-02-10T08:32:17] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> that is not possible as docker health can only return 0,1,2
10 [2018-02-11T08:31:09] <AshokRajuDevops> can we run multiple health check commands  for one container??
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-10T08:05:29] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> AshokRajuDevops: health check really depends on what is running inside your container. If you for example have a webserver running with a mangement port and you expose that you can use that to do health checks
2 [2018-02-10T08:10:35] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-02-10T08:11:22] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> Seems you do not even have to expose it you need to specify which command inside the container you want to run for the healthcheck
4 [2018-02-10T08:25:33] <FrederikBrinckTruelsen> tomcat has a mangement port on 8081 for healthchecks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-10T13:16:26] <develroo> Hey guys. is there way to link docker containers after creation? I have a web-proxy container which cannot resolve names of a guacamole container ?
2 [2018-02-10T13:17:49] <develroo> I used to just specify the ip but that keeps changing depending on restarts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-11T11:37:44] <robbyoconnor> that is not possible as docker health can only return 0,1,2Not entirely true @FrederikBrinckTruelsen  -- You can write a bash function which returns 0,1 or 2 based on http status codes...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-11T17:01:30] <mikeevstropov> Hi guys! Do i need to make a db instances for each an applications, or use a single db for it all?
2 [2018-02-11T17:47:12] <mikeevstropov> SISheogorath: Thank you for reply!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-11T17:41:13] <SISheogorath> mikeevstropov: I prefer to go for one per application because it's easier to backup file filesystem snapshots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-11T18:11:16] <AshokRajuDevops> robbyoconnor: deployment in progress and deployment failure both returns 1 and health check waits till timeout.. how we can exit before timeout if it deployment failure

1 [2018-02-12T11:04:37] <joel-bernard> Hi guys, have you feedback about high sierra OS X  APFS filesystem performance with docker for mac ? i use docker-sync alternative but it's just waiting for the performance to become an acceptable day
2 [2018-02-12T11:19:18] <pedroparraortega> i’m using docker under high sierra OS X APFS filesystem and i don’t have any performance issue
3 [2018-02-12T11:22:31] <joel-bernard> pedroparraortega: thx for your feedback... my performance problem is with big project with npm libs or composer vendor sync... Have you same project profile ?
4 [2018-02-12T11:23:30] <pedroparraortega> right now i’m using it with a project with a lot of php libraries, php7, apache, and a huge docker mysql database
5 [2018-02-12T11:23:41] <pedroparraortega> and it’s working fine
6 [2018-02-12T11:24:57] <pedroparraortega> and redis - memcached
7 [2018-02-12T11:26:52] <joel-bernard> pedroparraortega: thx, i will test that when MacOS upgrade will be finished and i will shared betchmark if ihave performance problem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-13T00:24:09] <zebralight> hello. I was wondering if anyone has any leads on how to run a docker linux container on a windows host that will persist all the changes made to it using package updates from the distro's repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-13T08:02:37] <hmrc87_twitter> hi, any idea how to mount a volume between containers (for logfiles) withouth root permissions? Within my containers there is no root available
2 [2018-02-13T08:21:13] <hmrc87_twitter> yes I did that, it appears within the containers but it's permissions are root:root
3 [2018-02-13T08:21:30] <hmrc87_twitter> So that the user running (in my case Apache airflow) which is called airflow is not able to work with it
4 [2018-02-13T08:22:43] <hmrc87_twitter> I am trying out this way because somehow when Container:Webserver calls Container:Worker via HTTP in order to get logs it is always using the company proxy. I have to explicitly set NO_PROXY=thecontainerid in order to make it work. But how can I automate this?  I thought about adding the Docker-Subnet to NO_PROXY but the variable does not work with CIDR notation in my case
5 [2018-02-13T08:48:42] <hmrc87_twitter> So a trick would be to unset the HTTP_PROXY variable of the docker-container. I provided this variable during build-time. Then no traffic, including inter-container-traffic is routed via proxy. But then I cannot call the outside world (which is OK for now...).
6 [2018-02-13T13:04:30] <hmrc87_twitter> Why dont you want to use the same image? I am using a linux docker container setup on Debian8 and the same one on Windows 10 using docker-machine and VirtualBox
7 [2018-02-13T13:05:19] <hmrc87_twitter> However it is not so easy regarding file permissions in volume mounts etc. But it is doable
8 [2018-02-13T13:06:07] <rakeshbimra_twitter> Hi@hmrc87_twitter, do we need to configure linux docker container or can we do with docker for windows?
9 [2018-02-13T13:06:27] <rakeshbimra_twitter> We are using windows OS and we installed docker for windows

1 [2018-02-15T09:46:44] <juboba> hey guys. I have a Dockerfile which downloads some source to a mounted volume. It seems I cannot do this (or at least it is shadowed by the volume specification, in the docker-compose file). What would be the correct way of doing this?I need the source (or part of it) to be available to the developer.It seems to me that the correct way would be to create a Makefile or a shell script to download the source and then run the docker-compose build, but if I did that it would be Host-OS dependant (either use wget, curl or none can be installed in host machine)
2 [2018-02-15T09:47:15] <juboba> I can pastebin both files if someone can help :D
3 [2018-02-15T12:45:48] <juboba> I think the sane solution is to have the source files provided by the HOST
4 [2018-02-15T12:46:40] <juboba> because it doesn't sound very good to have a docker-contained image to manipulate the host's directory
5 [2018-02-15T12:47:22] <juboba> thanks for the interest in helping@asadrao11but I think what I had in mind is not possible (and if it was it would be not safe)
6 [2018-02-15T12:49:08] <juboba> I have a new question though, I have 2 containers defined in my docker-compose file. One is for a web server and the other one for database (mysql listening on port 3306).I don't know if I should connect both usinglinkorexposeing the port.

1 [2018-02-15T19:36:23] <codesahil> I wanted to ask if im running a application on docker swarm mode with multiple tests running in parallel on the same machine in containers, will thosecontainers will have the same IP addresses or would interferewith each other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-15T19:42:45] <asadrao11> Multihost Networking is the key feature of docker swarm.. you can specify an overlay network for your services. The swarm manager automatically assigns address to the containers on the overlay network.

The exploit has been fixed and the messages removed but you could still be affected. You can check whether you are still affected by following the instructions in the blog post, [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-02-25T00:50:09] <charlesread> Hi all, I am hoping to get some clarification aboutDockerfiles and theVOLUMEinstruction.  What is the point of theVOLUMEinstruction if to really do any mounting you have to usedocker run ... --volume|mount ...?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-25T07:09:54] <MakanTaghizadeh> Hi@charlesread,VOLUMEis just an instruction which instructsDocker Enginethat this docker image has a mount point. If you don’t bind it to a mount point in host or a volume when you’re running the image usingdocker run, theDocker Engineautomatically create a volume and binds it to the path you specified in your Dockerfile.

8 [2018-02-27T14:37:13] <MakanTaghizadeh> 2- You can instructDocker Enginethat I want to switch my working directory from one layer on, like the following: [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-02-27T14:37:45] <Leeaandrob> interesting thing... for the .config works I need to do this?WORKDIR?

21 [2018-02-27T14:47:35] <MakanTaghizadeh> I guess you’ve got to update apt package list once after adding new repo url. I mean the line 33 should be:RUN echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list && apt update && apt install yarn

1 [2018-02-27T20:51:39] <harshana5> Hey guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-27T20:52:57] <harshana5> we are farily new to docker, Iam trying to setup docker machine to deploy containers to my remote hosts. the documentation is bit unclear so i was wondering if one of you can help me out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-27T22:56:25] <j0nathan_davies_twitter> Hi - new to docker, enjoying getting stuck in but a bit confused conceptually by something. Wonder if anyone can help out?
2 [2018-02-27T22:57:12] <j0nathan_davies_twitter> I’m running a jira instance using this image: [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-02-27T22:58:20] <j0nathan_davies_twitter> By modifying the Volume part of the dockerfile toVOLUME ["~/jira-home:/var/atlassian/jira:rw", "~/jira-home:/opt/atlassian/jira/logs:rw”]I can get the data to persist
4 [2018-02-27T23:20:46] <j0nathan_davies_twitter> My question is, how do I share this instance with other people, so they sign in to my instance, but any modifications they make are also persisted for all other users?As it stands I assume anyone who runs my image (with the amended docker file) will be prompted to start a new instance, which will persist data on their computer only, as opposed to just logging into my instance.Can anyone give me any pointers  for solving this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-27T23:48:57] <Toxicable> Hey all, Anyone happen to know how to set a host in a image that will remain for any images deriving from it?I've only found --add-host and extra_host but i'd prefer to build it into the image rather than in the commands
2 [2018-02-28T03:58:50] <Toxicable> SISheogorath: yeah that's what I though, ohwell looks like I'll have to inline host file edit scripts when I need it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T03:43:15] <SISheogorath> Toxicable: No, not possible. Neither hostname nor changes on /etc/hosts will survive.
2 [2018-02-28T03:44:58] <SISheogorath> If you really want it, you can try to hack it into the entrypoint script, but that a ugly havk and only works as long as all derivates call this script.
3 [2018-02-28T03:47:35] <SISheogorath> j0nathan_davies_twitter: the way you use the Volume statement in your docker file makes no sense .-. you can't bindmount with this statement
4 [2018-02-28T03:48:42] <SISheogorath> harshana5: don't ask to ask, bring up your question and if someone can help they will.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T04:00:29] <SISheogorath> mjosef89: the warning appears because you use the same "project name" from docker-compose perspective. By default docker-compose uses the directory name as project name and prefix. (In your example docker) when it now finds a container with this prefix, which is not listed as a service in its compose file, it expects that it was deleted from it but the container was never stopped and this way became an orphan container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T05:45:32] <yosefrow> you can override the default compose project name by defining the env var COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME as a unique string on ur host machine [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-02-28T10:50:14] <yosefrow> vito-c: I believe by services containers brought up by the same compose have the other service names added to their /etc/hosts by default and can be acessed like [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-02-28T07:06:54] <vito-c> I would like my containers to communicate to each other via host name. Let's say I have container foo running on port 9000 and I have container bar that would like to talk to foo via [<-LINK->] is there a config in docker-compose I can set to do this
2 [2018-02-28T16:11:32] <vito-c> mcordoba: @yosefrowyah I know I can hit [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-02-28T16:11:58] <vito-c> but what I need is something that maps that to [<-LINK->] for example
4 [2018-02-28T18:13:56] <vito-c> mcordoba: no it's for development
5 [2018-02-28T18:14:31] <vito-c> I'm using traefik for proxying but I'm not sure how to set it up to do internal host names for the containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T07:19:37] <hiteshchaudhari-tudip> MakanTaghizadeh: I'am using OSX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T10:58:38] <mcordoba> yosefrow: yes it is just like@yosefrowsaid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-02-28T17:45:39] <mcordoba> vito-c: so you are talking about production? you can use a reverse proxy like nginx
2 [2018-03-01T10:47:18] <mcordoba> vito-c: I don't see the point to use domains in dev... you will have extra complexity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-02T07:31:14] <jdickey> Hey, folks. Really basic question, but I\'ve somehow missed this in the docs.I\'ve several (>10) images, ergo Dockerfiles, that I maintain that differ only by the image that they\'re based on. I\'d really love to DRY that up, so I have one "master" Dockerfile or template that I can use to spin off variations as needed. What\'s my best course of action?

2 [2018-03-02T08:31:06] <chan_seeker_twitter> any dockerfile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-02T09:13:37] <jdickey> cheshirecode: Interesting, but different than what I'm asking about. If I understand multistage builds correctly, they're to clean up things that have often used multiple Dockerfiles to create a single product; the classic example (that they demonstrate) is probably dev vs prod builds. What I'm after is a bit different; I want to apply the same steps to each of a group of base images (e.g., Ruby version/base OS combinations such asruby:2.4.2-jessievsruby:2.5.0-alpine). Any other ideas?
2 [2018-03-02T09:15:38] <jdickey> IIUC, multistage builds are great if you want to apply a collection of different option paths to a common base image. I'm going the other way: applying a common set of actions to a collection of base images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-02T09:28:38] <cheshirecode> If I understand correctly, you want to create containers based on your given base image as input? Maybe you need to generate Dockerfiles on the fly and consume them. Look into [<-LINK->] for more ideas. I haven't explored this problem in details yet so let me know if you come up with a working solution too. Would love to hear.
2 [2018-03-02T09:30:52] <jdickey> Thanks! That looksreallypromising
3 [2018-03-02T09:37:15] <jdickey> cheshirecode: …and I'm an idiot. I can apparently get what I want with simple build arguments. I missed [<-LINK->] on previous read-throughs of the docs; the second example isexactlywhat I'm looking for, and makes my lifesomuch easier. Thanks for your help and patience :)

1 [2018-03-02T10:40:38] <SISheogorath> vito-c: use network aliases and add the full domain name there, rhen it works. By default it's not planned to use full domain names
2 [2018-03-02T10:42:23] <SISheogorath> hullsean: please don't recommend links anymore they are deprecated and neither work in swarm setups nor should they be used anywhere else because they have some ugly side effects
3 [2018-03-02T10:44:18] <SISheogorath> mderdem: yes, when you can access the base image, you can build it without a problem as long as you cpu arch matches

Or they can be reachable if they are on the same network ? What I've understood it's, only exposed ports will be reachable from internet. But for an internal network use?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-05T16:00:09] <SISheogorath> MonXBZH: yes, when containers are on the same networks, they can access every port. No need to expose anyone. Exposed ports are only for external connections outside of docker

3 [2018-03-06T05:50:55] <killerspaz> probably, but i figure it's easier to let docker-compose deal with the networking segregation... works pretty well instead of having to instrument every service definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-06T02:44:21] <cheshirecode> would it be possible to orchestrate 2 services and 1 proxy in the same docker-compose.yml file so you can run 1 command?
2 [2018-03-06T07:10:12] <cheshirecode> same train of thought :D, since I could route from nginx like this [<-CODE->] with app1  as a defined service in the same compose file where nginx proxy is another server, I've been adding more services to the same network basically

9 [2018-03-06T10:25:48] <duyngha> Did I make something wrong?
10 [2018-03-06T10:25:53] <duyngha> please help me!
11 [2018-03-06T10:25:59] <duyngha> thank you so much

13 [2018-03-07T01:35:21] <duyngha> SISheogorath: It didnot show me anything else. btw inapp/folder I created stuff ofnodejsserver withexpressandnodemon
14 [2018-03-07T01:56:31] <duyngha> killerspaz: @SISheogorathI resolved my issue. it caused I expose wrong port in Dockerfile. the nodejs run in default port 3000. So docker works fine. I just need to change the port to 3000 and map it in todocker-compose.yml. Thank you so much for your responding guys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-06T11:08:59] <SISheogorath> duyngha: By "this page isn\'t working", can you provide a more technical error message?
2 [2018-03-06T21:48:32] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-06T14:14:47] <davidmichaelkarr> that error means it got to your app.check the logs of the app container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-06T15:22:25] <killerspaz> cheshirecode: oh, that's how you're meant to do it... Just that i need the same services up twice to simulate replicated cluster of services, so it's slightly a different problem... .But yes, I do the same thing, but also have a fallback for the deployment (using a proxy_pass to localhost) since docker isn't the deploy target
2 [2018-03-06T15:59:15] <killerspaz> duyngha: that all looks correct for the most part.... as stated, check the logs (docker-compose logs app), and if nothing jumps out, try going into the container (docker exec -it YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME bash) and do some investigation (ie,netstat -tanp)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-06T21:28:07] <lidderupk> thank you@SISheogorath.

1 [2018-03-07T05:27:40] <fabiomolinaruol> Hello all! I just finished compiling a survey with more than 350 open source software project members which, together with some communication theory, we used to define a set ofbest practices and guidelines for using Gitter(in fact, it probably applies toany chat-like platform).If anybody would be interest on it, or in applying them in this community, or your other projects, there is a [<-LINK->] you can fill to get the guidelines. The survey takes something between just10 seconds to a maximum of 2 minutes to filland it is intended to help us validate the guidelines in the future.There is also a small [<-LINK->] I wrote with a really short description about the study; in case you would be curious about it.Of course, feel free to send the [<-LINK->] to anyone you would like to share these guidelines with.

6 [2018-03-07T14:52:05] <aroca> i think i can manage with it. :)
7 [2018-03-07T14:52:14] <SISheogorath> for testing it should be enough

2 [2018-03-07T14:52:29] <Leeaandrob> I am trying to use docker-compose to run node applications
3 [2018-03-07T14:52:37] <Leeaandrob> but it fails always :(
4 [2018-03-07T14:53:39] <Leeaandrob>  [<-CODE->]

7 [2018-03-07T14:54:46] <Leeaandrob> what's the error on my recipes? :(
8 [2018-03-07T14:55:10] <SISheogorath> the more important question is: What error message do you get?
9 [2018-03-07T14:55:38] <Leeaandrob> hey@SISheogorathhow are you?
10 [2018-03-07T14:55:59] <SISheogorath> Leeaandrob: I'm fine, thanks, how about you?
11 [2018-03-07T14:56:01] <Leeaandrob>  [<-CODE->]
12 [2018-03-07T14:56:12] <Leeaandrob> I'm fine too@SISheogoraththanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-07T14:59:20] <SISheogorath> I really suggest you to learn how to read error messages. It\'s very, very clearly stated why it fails: "Error: /build/node_modules/scrypt/build/Release/scrypt.node: invalid ELF header" -> the version of the module you are using in your container is not compiled against the right version
2 [2018-03-07T14:59:37] <SISheogorath> Why does this happen? Because you run a different OS on your host than in the container
3 [2018-03-07T14:59:56] <SISheogorath> How to resolve? Stop sharing the node_modules directory and install the dependencies inside the container
4 [2018-03-07T15:00:03] <Leeaandrob> you have right!
5 [2018-03-07T15:00:11] <Leeaandrob> but my idea is avoid this situation...
6 [2018-03-07T15:00:26] <SISheogorath> or rewrite everything to use the same OS as your host OS
7 [2018-03-07T15:00:43] <Leeaandrob> ok thanks@SISheogorathyou have right! sorry!
8 [2018-03-07T15:01:01] <SISheogorath> If you need a cached version of node_modules, use multi-staged builds
9 [2018-03-07T15:01:14] <Leeaandrob> how?
10 [2018-03-07T15:01:35] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
11 [2018-03-07T15:02:32] <SISheogorath> Build one container that runs npm install and uses the same base image, then copy the node_modules directory from this image to the one you want to use and rebuild
12 [2018-03-07T15:03:12] <Leeaandrob> hm... ok thanks@SISheogorath
13 [2018-03-07T15:04:14] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
14 [2018-03-07T15:04:40] <Leeaandrob> sometimes the bad of programmer is not read the output ;)
15 [2018-03-07T15:07:59] <SISheogorath> No problem, that's why we are around ^^ Just as hint: Next time first read/post the error and the sources only on request :D because some people can tell you the problem without reading the source ;)
16 [2018-03-07T15:08:32] <Leeaandrob> sure!
17 [2018-03-07T15:09:45] <SISheogorath> In a forum you would go the other way around, but here space is limited :D
18 [2018-03-07T15:10:15] <Leeaandrob> yes you have absolutely right@SISheogorathsorry again!
19 [2018-03-07T15:10:30] <SISheogorath> No need to be sorry ;)
20 [2018-03-07T15:13:15] <Leeaandrob> I am following the tutorial :)
21 [2018-03-08T14:12:28] <SISheogorath> Do you run through any kind of proxy or VPN?

1 [2018-03-09T10:58:33] <maksimyugai> hi, everyone. Can someone say, how I can delete docker image with configuration? I run jenkins docker image, but when I delete it, jobs which I created earlier, appears again
2 [2018-03-09T12:05:49] <maksimyugai> gokhankuyucak: thnx for answer, I found out how to delete it. But I don\'t understand what does this line mean -v "$HOME":/home. I try run jenkins docker image from this guide [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-09T10:59:36] <hamon-e> Hellosince this morning i have an error when i try to launch my docker compose with a custom network and ip settings [<-CODE->] the only change on my computer was the update [<-CODE->] Here is my docker compose: https://transfer.sh/hOiDY/docker-compose.ymlThx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-09T11:56:42] <gokhankuyucak> maksimyugai: hi, are you mounting same value everytime like -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home? If so you need to check your local jenkins_home folder while you're mapping.
2 [2018-03-09T12:16:08] <gokhankuyucak> maksimyugai: by using command -v(volume), you are sharing your local folder with container. In your example -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home means that jenkins container will use your local env jenkins_data instead of container folder. we can assume that /var/jenkins_home is a shortcut in container which maps to local jenkins-data. So when you remove jenkins image it does not delete your jenkins-data. You can delete that folder after you remove image or you can give another name while running new jenkins image like -v jenkins-data_20180309:/var/jenkins_home
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-09T12:16:49] <ChazUK> Are there any Docker & Jenkins experts here?

4 [2018-03-09T14:47:42] <mohamedaittaleb> welcome :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-09T14:37:45] <mohamedaittaleb> Maybe you Can use Env Vars I think
2 [2018-03-09T14:39:28] <mohamedaittaleb> The ARG instruction defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command using the  --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag. If a user specifies a build argument that was not defined in the Dockerfile, the build outputs an error.
3 [2018-03-09T14:40:56] <mohamedaittaleb> this should help [<-LINK->]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-12T07:59:56] <ovelindstrom> maksimyugai: , IMHO, you should run your Jenkins Server and the Jenkins Worker in separate Docker instances. I have used the python image ( [<-LINK->] ) as a base to our python builds. Influences can be found at [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-03-12T11:40:17] <SISheogorath> by upload you mean push to a registry or do you mean pull to your machine?

7 [2018-03-13T12:10:03] <SISheogorath> yes and yes
8 [2018-03-13T12:10:30] <farukhkhan21_twitter> ok. do I need to explicitly disable the ipv6? or by default it is disabled?
9 [2018-03-13T12:10:44] <farukhkhan21_twitter> on the driver_opts
10 [2018-03-13T12:10:54] <SISheogorath> depends on your setup ^^
11 [2018-03-13T12:11:15] <farukhkhan21_twitter> My host server has IPv6 configured and working. Running CoreOS
12 [2018-03-13T12:11:32] <farukhkhan21_twitter> but I dont want my containers to have any form of IPv6 functions
13 [2018-03-13T12:11:44] <SISheogorath> then probably it's not the worst idea to explicitly disable it
14 [2018-03-13T12:12:18] <farukhkhan21_twitter> alright. the app_net is just a name of the new network right? I can rename this to anything?
15 [2018-03-13T12:12:28] <SISheogorath> yes
16 [2018-03-13T12:13:11] <farukhkhan21_twitter> lastly, is there any other things, you think I should add for a LAMP stack networking in here? Or anything to secure the network further?
17 [2018-03-13T12:14:01] <farukhkhan21_twitter> trying to design a lamp stack for production usage
18 [2018-03-13T12:17:03] <SISheogorath> You shouldn't do this as long as you are not at least a bit into the docker concepts
19 [2018-03-13T12:17:18] <farukhkhan21_twitter> just trying to learn bit by bit
20 [2018-03-13T12:17:39] <farukhkhan21_twitter> on a practical (sort of testing) project.
21 [2018-03-13T12:17:43] <SISheogorath> That's totally fine, but may not go instantly in production with it
22 [2018-03-13T12:17:56] <farukhkhan21_twitter> no I won't
23 [2018-03-13T12:18:08] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I will test it out thoroughly before doing that
24 [2018-03-13T12:18:34] <farukhkhan21_twitter> any suggestions on making the network more robust?
25 [2018-03-13T12:23:03] <SISheogorath> There are no universal hints. it highly depends on what you want to do and what you want to use
26 [2018-03-13T12:23:27] <SISheogorath> apart from that for a local setup the network defaults are pretty good
27 [2018-03-13T12:23:43] <SISheogorath> but usually you don't use coreos without an orchestrator
28 [2018-03-13T12:23:55] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I see
29 [2018-03-13T12:24:14] <farukhkhan21_twitter> btw when to use \'\' instead of "" or when to use nothing at all for boolean or strings like false.
30 [2018-03-13T12:25:39] <SISheogorath> You can use\'\'as well as""everywhere. booleans are a native type. Just check the yaml specification
31 [2018-03-13T12:27:09] <farukhkhan21_twitter> alright
32 [2018-03-13T13:08:55] <SISheogorath> everything stating with an - is an array element. otherwise it becomes and object. As I said, please read the yaml specification
33 [2018-03-13T13:09:15] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T12:29:00] <farukhkhan21_twitter> why there is an - in the subnet when there is none at the com.docker.network line? what are the differences between these two?
2 [2018-03-13T12:29:40] <farukhkhan21_twitter> subnet: 173.25.5.0/24
3 [2018-03-13T12:29:47] <farukhkhan21_twitter> com.docker.network.enable_ipv6: "false"
4 [2018-03-13T12:29:58] <farukhkhan21_twitter> the subnet line has an extra - at the front
5 [2018-03-13T12:34:04] <farukhkhan21_twitter> is there no difference?
6 [2018-03-13T12:38:06] <farukhkhan21_twitter> and should I explicitly declare a gateway such as: gateway: 173.25.5.1?
7 [2018-03-13T13:16:12] <farukhkhan21_twitter> alright
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T13:33:34] <farukhkhan21_twitter> btw what you guys think about alpine in production?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T13:35:51] <SISheogorath> I build almost all my images on alpine
2 [2018-03-13T13:36:41] <SISheogorath> it makes deployments way faster and minimizes the footprint of your containers. But of course you need to know how to handle it, as it's musle based and this way not as the most distros
3 [2018-03-13T13:37:14] <farukhkhan21_twitter> does apps under musl libc behaving good?
4 [2018-03-13T13:37:38] <SISheogorath> Not all, but most, yes, once you made them build
5 [2018-03-13T13:38:16] <farukhkhan21_twitter> ow I see.
6 [2018-03-13T13:38:35] <farukhkhan21_twitter> did you ever try using bind under alpine?
7 [2018-03-13T13:39:25] <SISheogorath> nope
8 [2018-03-13T13:40:19] <farukhkhan21_twitter> in my end bind is behaving weird. not sure whether its a bind config problem or the alpine base
9 [2018-03-13T13:41:43] <farukhkhan21_twitter> when I dig any hostname from the php-fpm container which depends on bind it usually ends up giving me the bind dns wildcard ip
10 [2018-03-13T13:48:22] <farukhkhan21_twitter> should I explicitly declare gateway on the network?@SISheogorath
11 [2018-03-13T13:51:15] <SISheogorath> praveensinghpokharia: Go for it, what's the problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T13:49:56] <ghost~59eab51fd73408ce4f7b031f> I want to install xwiki over tomcat and MySQL without pull,so,basically a dockerfile. To build image for xwiki as I don't have access to outside docker public repo..
2 [2018-03-13T13:50:55] <ghost~59eab51fd73408ce4f7b031f> I will create a image and upload it to private docker hub repo
3 [2018-03-13T13:53:00] <ghost~59eab51fd73408ce4f7b031f> I do not want to pull image, I hv tomcat mysql installed.. I have war of xwiki as well
4 [2018-03-13T13:53:13] <ghost~59eab51fd73408ce4f7b031f> Any sample for that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T14:15:15] <SISheogorath> if you really want to build everything yourself, check out how to build base images. meansFROM scratchbut keep in mind, this is nothing for newbies. You should really be aware of how docker works when you want to build base images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-13T14:29:54] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Hey@SISheogorathI will be re-writing a new dockerfile with alpine base for bind dns. I will post it here and please look into it if I am doing something wrong

1 [2018-03-14T09:13:16] <mohamedaittaleb> Hi All,any docker certified guy here ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-14T09:26:50] <grofit> Apologies if this is a super simple question but I am struggling to find much info on the subject, so currently the main pathway to create a docker container and share it for other applications (i.e you have an api and a front end) is to add a dockerfile to each, then push that container to docker hub
2 [2018-03-14T09:28:56] <grofit> So I was wondering is there another way to basically share a docker container without using docker hub? i.e we would like to be able to somehow expose the containers from our build server in some fashion for our other apps to depend on rather than the docker hub, so is there some way to consume a docker container from a file or some other place other than docker hub?
3 [2018-03-14T09:29:30] <grofit> A bit like how with NPM you can output your stuff as tar files and just install that tar file rather than using npm repo
4 [2018-03-14T09:29:33] <mohamedaittaleb> you can work locally
5 [2018-03-14T09:29:44] <mohamedaittaleb> without pushing your images to docker hub
6 [2018-03-14T09:30:41] <grofit> but lets say we are all on different PCs
7 [2018-03-14T09:30:57] <grofit> so its not like we all have the same docker images cached (I appreciate I could clone them and build them manually)
8 [2018-03-14T09:31:22] <mohamedaittaleb> hum think about nexus locally registry
9 [2018-03-14T09:31:28] <grofit> but it would feel nicer having some sort of way to resolve containers on our network, like we have a custom npm repo and a custom nuget repo on the network
10 [2018-03-14T09:31:55] <mohamedaittaleb> you can Create a private nexus docker repo
11 [2018-03-14T09:32:16] <grofit> ah ok will look into that, but as it was raised by a co-worker here, is there a way to basically distribute a container as a single file which can be used on another computer to spin up an instance of that container?
12 [2018-03-14T09:32:30] <grofit> i.e amy-container.tar
13 [2018-03-14T09:33:38] <mohamedaittaleb> Actually a container is an instance of an image if I'm not wrong, so you can share the image with the dockerfile, your colleague can build the same image and run the same container
14 [2018-03-14T09:33:46] <mohamedaittaleb> based on your Dockerfile.
15 [2018-03-14T09:34:09] <mohamedaittaleb> my knowledge stops here lol; maybe someone else can help with other solution
16 [2018-03-14T09:35:02] <grofit> oh right, so I could literally just use the git repo (assuming a dockerfile in root) and it would just work like a container?
17 [2018-03-14T09:36:12] <grofit> there isnt much info on how its all packaged, its all just magic
18 [2018-03-14T09:37:21] <grofit> so like with npm it says all the formats it supports [<-LINK->] (I know NPM is a completely different tool to docker, but using it here as an example of a cli telling you how you can run the packages)
19 [2018-03-14T09:40:53] <grofit> but the docker documentation just seems to show you how to use local docker tags or docker hub tags
20 [2018-03-14T09:59:31] <mohamedaittaleb> yes you can write your own dockerfile and add it to your git repo so anyway else will just build the image and run the container. I don't know actually why you want to use docker so I can help you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-14T10:03:59] <grofit> we use docker for a few things, mainly just wrapping up 3rd party services we want to consume, then just have a docker compose file which ties it all together
2 [2018-03-14T10:04:09] <grofit> but this is just done on devs pcs for easier environmental setup
3 [2018-03-14T10:04:30] <grofit> but in this case we are looking at how we can basically move it past the dev stage without relying on docker hub
4 [2018-03-14T10:05:22] <grofit> so we have an api (or many) which each have their own docker file (setup/expose ports etc), then we have a front end which would be setup with a web server as well, but would compose with the api parts (maybe some other bits)
5 [2018-03-14T10:05:39] <grofit> so would be nice to have all that configuration somewhere, but not need to consume it from docker hub
6 [2018-03-14T10:05:55] <grofit> this way we can keep it all private, but not need to worry about persisting it externally and the cost incurred for this
7 [2018-03-14T10:06:35] <grofit> its like with github, you can host it all on there and pay for it to be private, or setup your own onsite gitlab which gives pretty much same features we care about, but without any cost or external hosting
8 [2018-03-14T10:20:15] <grofit> sure sure, but they seem to want to keep more stuff on site and not have to pay external parties if possible (i.e custom nuget, npm repos etc), which is why I think they are steering away from hosting on docker hub
9 [2018-03-14T10:21:29] <SISheogorath> ?
10 [2018-03-14T10:21:31] <grofit> I will speak to them about costings, as they are hoping to do it on the cheap, hence why they were hoping they could just piggy back off Teamcity, or just host some open source repo or something
11 [2018-03-14T10:23:03] <grofit> by open source repo I mean like how you can use verdaccio as an open source private npm repo
12 [2018-03-14T10:23:43] <grofit> Really I am just caught in the cross fire here between a team who likes docker as an approach, but a business who doesnt really want to pay for anything they dont need to
13 [2018-03-14T10:24:38] <grofit> (and there seems to be some pressure to keep all source/builds etc internal, not external, for right or wrong)
14 [2018-03-14T10:25:42] <grofit> Anyway its probably all getting out of scope now, my main query I guess was "can I generate a single file and expose that somewhere for somewhere todocker run <my-file>and I guess as you mention there is thedocker savecommand which seems to do this, but by the looks of it you dont run those,  just import them then run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-14T10:12:18] <SISheogorath> without any costJust saying, that's not true, as you usually pay the person that maintains it, but doesn't matter here.share a docker container without using docker hub?A self-hosted docker registry. Here you go: https://docs.docker.com/registry/
2 [2018-03-14T10:12:31] <SISheogorath> grofit: ^
3 [2018-03-14T10:13:25] <SISheogorath> And yes, you can also export docker images as file ->docker savebut it's not recommended as it breaks layering.
4 [2018-03-14T11:04:10] <SISheogorath> grofit: yes, you have to import them before you can run. There is no way around this, without using a registry.
5 [2018-03-14T11:04:47] <SISheogorath> but if you want to run a registry internal, you can usedocker run internalrepo:port/imagename:tag
6 [2018-03-14T11:05:10] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: That's something you should ask in a CoreOS channel ^^
7 [2018-03-14T11:08:31] <grofit> Thanks@SISheogorath
8 [2018-03-14T11:08:47] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-14T10:56:49] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Does CoreOS installation by default enables docker API?
2 [2018-03-14T11:09:31] <farukhkhan21_twitter> sorry my bad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-14T13:29:43] <stherrienaspnet> Hello I'm new to docker and i have a question that will help me to decide if I can got with it or not
2 [2018-03-14T13:30:46] <stherrienaspnet> I have an electronic device like a Raspberry PI, actually this is an ODROID-C2 running Ubuntu 16.04 on Arm processor
3 [2018-03-14T13:31:06] <stherrienaspnet> I know there is a Docker CE for Arm I can install
4 [2018-03-14T13:31:58] <stherrienaspnet> I question my self if I would be able to use any linux container on docker hub?
5 [2018-03-14T13:35:35] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I think it depends on the ARM version of the board
6 [2018-03-14T13:36:24] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I think if your ARM processor is ARMv8 it can run almost every image from docker hub@stherrienaspnet
7 [2018-03-14T13:36:30] <farukhkhan21_twitter> but surely there are some exceptions
8 [2018-03-14T13:36:43] <stherrienaspnet> i will check now
9 [2018-03-14T13:37:07] <stherrienaspnet> Amlogic ARM Cortex-A53(ARMv8) 1.5Ghz quad core CPUs
10 [2018-03-14T13:37:55] <stherrienaspnet> example i will need to install mongodb, so i found a container for that on docker hub, will it work?
11 [2018-03-14T13:39:15] <stherrienaspnet> i mean the mongo official docker container
12 [2018-03-14T13:39:46] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I think it will work without any problem. docker engine will handle the underlying stuffs. That's the beauty of docker.
13 [2018-03-14T13:40:10] <stherrienaspnet> cool
14 [2018-03-14T13:40:34] <farukhkhan21_twitter> but on ARMv7 or ARMv6 docker engine seems to behave a bit weird. That's why I am not sure about those two. ARMv8 is new and I think docker will work here just fine.
15 [2018-03-14T13:40:57] <stherrienaspnet> Thanks@farukhkhan21_twitter
16 [2018-03-14T13:41:53] <stherrienaspnet> Do you have some experience with docker compose?
17 [2018-03-14T13:42:19] <farukhkhan21_twitter> No problem. Actually I did some research on this because I was planning to do a ARMv8 docker and kubernetes cluster with multiple SBC's as my CI server.
18 [2018-03-14T13:42:40] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I have some. But it's still very limited. I am also kinda new to docker
19 [2018-03-14T13:42:55] <farukhkhan21_twitter> what you trying to achieve with docker-compose?
20 [2018-03-14T13:43:08] <stherrienaspnet> if you want cheap and get performance, look at ODROID-C2
21 [2018-03-14T13:43:57] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I was about to choose this board but some people reported different overheads on the board's hardware. Not really that is really true or not. I haven't tested one
22 [2018-03-14T13:44:01] <stherrienaspnet> On my ODROID i need to run mongodb+mosquitto(mqtt broker) + nodejs + angular(web app)
23 [2018-03-14T13:44:43] <stherrienaspnet> so i wandering how i will setup and run all these container so they can work togetter?
24 [2018-03-14T13:44:44] <farukhkhan21_twitter> some type of IoT setup? pretty interesting.
25 [2018-03-14T13:44:50] <stherrienaspnet> Yes
26 [2018-03-14T13:45:10] <stherrienaspnet> really interesting
27 [2018-03-14T13:46:51] <stherrienaspnet> do we use docker compose to configure one large container container everything
28 [2018-03-14T13:47:25] <farukhkhan21_twitter> well, with my current knowledge I don't think I can guide you on this. I am still struggling to setup a LAMP stack for production usage. Some suggestions I can give you is that, proceed step by step. First try run the mongodb successfully. Then try nodejs and carry on like this. If everything works the way you want then just compile the whole thing in docker-compose file for fast deployments.
29 [2018-03-14T13:47:27] <stherrienaspnet> or we use it to make the link between multiple container running independently?
30 [2018-03-14T13:48:04] <stherrienaspnet> ok, thanks for your advice
31 [2018-03-14T13:48:16] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Actually it is a bad practice to use one container for multiple purpose or process. They say, one container one process which makes it more modular and manageable.
32 [2018-03-14T13:48:34] <farukhkhan21_twitter> docker-compose will help establishing the link and also it will make the deployment easy

1 [2018-03-14T13:49:50] <campbs> Hi i’m not sure if this is a docker question or a postregresql question but I am using Ory Hydra which is said to be best set up in a container. I want to connect it to a postgres DB i already have running. Am i able to connect these 2 even tho my DB isnt in a container? should I put it in a container ?
2 [2018-03-14T13:51:53] <farukhkhan21_twitter> not sure about what is the ory hydra. But just curious, where is your postgres DB?
3 [2018-03-14T13:52:04] <farukhkhan21_twitter> is it in another docker container?
4 [2018-03-14T13:52:12] <farukhkhan21_twitter> or is it in the host machine?
5 [2018-03-14T13:52:20] <farukhkhan21_twitter> or totally different server?
6 [2018-03-14T13:52:34] <campbs> i just have it locally
7 [2018-03-14T13:52:39] <campbs> it’s not in a container
8 [2018-03-14T13:54:04] <farukhkhan21_twitter> local as in your pc? or in the docker host machine?
9 [2018-03-14T13:54:19] <campbs> sorry local on my pc
10 [2018-03-14T13:55:29] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Well, then there's a lot of things to consider. Do you have a real ip which can be publicly accessible by anyone? and is your postgres allowing wildcard hosts?
11 [2018-03-14T13:57:20] <campbs> Im not really sure what you mean :( ( sorry im a learner) basically what i need to do is containerise the postgres db that i have now
12 [2018-03-14T13:58:24] <farukhkhan21_twitter> well then fire up a postgres container using docker with any official image
13 [2018-03-14T13:58:31] <farukhkhan21_twitter> and then export import your database
14 [2018-03-14T13:59:42] <farukhkhan21_twitter> When you will have the container running it will automatically connect to the bridge0 default network provided by docker. And see if oy hydra can connect to that bridge0 network to access the database. If oy hyndra is also using default brigde0 it will be able to connect to the postgres container
15 [2018-03-14T14:02:39] <farukhkhan21_twitter> No problem@campbslet me know if it works.

1 [2018-03-15T13:23:58] <loicdescotte> Hi all
2 [2018-03-15T13:24:59] <loicdescotte> I have a "cluster" of docker images on a single physical machine
3 [2018-03-15T13:25:38] <loicdescotte> They are running inside a docker network
4 [2018-03-15T13:25:57] <loicdescotte> is it possible to make this work on several physical machines?
5 [2018-03-15T13:26:35] <loicdescotte> i.e. defining a docker network through several physical machine so all docker images can continue to communicate seamlessly?
6 [2018-03-15T13:29:05] <SISheogorath> loicdescotte: check docker swarm :)
7 [2018-03-15T13:29:15] <loicdescotte> thanks!
8 [2018-03-15T13:29:31] <loicdescotte> I was reading this [<-LINK->]
9 [2018-03-15T13:29:52] <loicdescotte> I was not sure it was the right direction, so thanks :)
10 [2018-03-15T13:32:40] <SISheogorath> You're welcome :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T13:45:57] <Leeaandrob> SISheogorath: hello how are you?
2 [2018-03-15T13:46:24] <Leeaandrob> may i ask something for you? I am searching but I don't find anywhere how I can do this :(
3 [2018-03-15T13:48:52] <Leeaandrob> I am trying to find a better way to see output logs from applications running inside docker containers... do you have an idea?
4 [2018-03-15T13:49:14] <Leeaandrob>  [<-CODE->]
5 [2018-03-15T13:49:29] <Leeaandrob> I have a docker-compose.yml like this
6 [2018-03-15T14:17:44] <Leeaandrob> do you mean in myvolumes?
7 [2018-03-15T14:18:09] <Leeaandrob>  [<-CODE->]
8 [2018-03-15T14:18:20] <SISheogorath> yes
9 [2018-03-15T14:19:05] <Leeaandrob> is it can be better?
10 [2018-03-15T14:19:32] <Leeaandrob> I am reading about
11 [2018-03-15T14:19:47] <Leeaandrob> so I can to do like this:
12 [2018-03-15T14:20:42] <Leeaandrob>  [<-CODE->]
13 [2018-03-15T14:20:49] <Leeaandrob> SISheogorath: ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T13:46:33] <farukhkhan21_twitter> SISheogorath: does the official httpd docker image have mod_rewrite enabled by default?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T14:16:39] <SISheogorath> Leeaandrob: First hint: don't mount your tmpfs this exposes a lot of sensitive data to your container. Use this instead: [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-03-15T14:16:57] <SISheogorath> or use any other directory
3 [2018-03-15T14:17:27] <SISheogorath> also just push all logs to stdout and stderr. These will be handle by docker
4 [2018-03-15T14:19:20] <SISheogorath> I already linked the docs
5 [2018-03-15T14:19:33] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: Not really sure, but I guess so
6 [2018-03-15T14:21:16] <SISheogorath> isn't the example clear?
7 [2018-03-15T14:21:37] <Leeaandrob> nope :(
8 [2018-03-15T14:21:58] <Leeaandrob> I need to mount a tempory directory and maps for it?
9 [2018-03-15T14:22:27] <SISheogorath>  [<-CODE->]
10 [2018-03-15T14:22:59] <Leeaandrob> but i need to share the /tmp between the containers
11 [2018-03-15T14:23:21] <Leeaandrob> because db and portal are seeing the /tmp/file.json made by parity
12 [2018-03-15T14:26:14] <Leeaandrob> when i set this on my docker-compose.yml all containers likend will see for the same /tmp?
13 [2018-03-15T14:32:39] <Leeaandrob> anyway thanks@SISheogorath
14 [2018-03-15T14:35:58] <Leeaandrob> hhhhhaaaa I'm seeing your point now.. you have absolutely right about this.. I will change to pointing a specifying folder thanks so much@SISheogorath
15 [2018-03-15T15:52:41] <SISheogorath> You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T14:34:28] <SISheogorath> Leeaandrob: no, they won't see it. but if you really need to share a tmp dir between your containers, use something like /tmp/<somethingrandom> because root in your container is allowed to read EVERYTHING inside your container directories (by default) and this way can read all data in /tmp which are may sensitive
2 [2018-03-15T18:42:43] <SISheogorath> First of all, don't use links
3 [2018-03-15T18:43:29] <SISheogorath> they are deprecated since more than a year now and iirc ignored anyways in docker-compose version 3+

2 [2018-03-15T18:44:48] <farukhkhan21_twitter> does these docker-compose tags still work in version 3 yml files?
3 [2018-03-15T18:45:07] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: iirc they only work in version 3 or higher
4 [2018-03-15T18:45:26] <farukhkhan21_twitter> iirc mean?
5 [2018-03-15T18:45:56] <SISheogorath> iirc -> if I recall correct
6 [2018-03-15T18:46:09] <farukhkhan21_twitter> ow xD
7 [2018-03-15T18:46:34] <SISheogorath> Here you go: [<-LINK->]
8 [2018-03-15T18:47:04] <farukhkhan21_twitter> SISheogorath: what do you think? should I use these limits in a production php app? Or should I let the app take whatever resources it wants from the host?
9 [2018-03-15T18:48:04] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: depends on your setup, if you run one VM per service, why not? If you run multiple services per VM you may want to be able to control it a bit
10 [2018-03-15T18:48:50] <SISheogorath> tusharbudhe0302: also what do you publish the node ports for? There is no need to do this.
11 [2018-03-15T18:49:37] <farukhkhan21_twitter> SISheogorath: running one processes per container. apache in one, php-fpm in one and mysql in one. total 3 containers.
12 [2018-03-15T18:49:41] <SISheogorath> tusharbudhe0302: last but not least, please run inspect on your docker network and/or your node containers to see ifnode1is even  a network alias
13 [2018-03-15T18:50:36] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: yes, that's how it should be, but I was actually talking about running one VM per container. But seems to be not the case, as you use docker swarm and why should you want to do this then? So yes, use ressource limits
14 [2018-03-15T18:51:05] <SISheogorath> if you want to prevent overcommitment, then you may even want to set reservations = limits
15 [2018-03-15T18:51:23] <SISheogorath> But that highly depends on what you are about to sell
16 [2018-03-15T18:51:47] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I am not using docker swarm. Just a coreos baremetal and trying to host a cricket news codeigniter blog for production.
17 [2018-03-15T18:53:59] <farukhkhan21_twitter> and seems like my php script is having some good amount of memory leak. Bad code by one of my colleague. that's why was thinking to restrict the resources in every container so that the host remains safe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T19:08:44] <adrice727> I'm having an issue running ansbtapp in a docker container.  The app starts running, but then crashes after serving a single request.  The container remains running.  I've built my image a few different ways,sbt-pack,sbt-assembly,sbt-native-packager, but there's no difference.  Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?
2 [2018-03-16T21:15:35] <adrice727> tusharbudhe0302: Any luck?  I'm having a similar issue with redis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-15T19:14:42] <farukhkhan21_twitter>  [<-CODE->] Can I use these API json calls out of the box? or need to enable docker api manually? And how to use these api calls from outside the host from another desktop application?
2 [2018-03-16T13:09:35] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Thanks@SISheogorathreally helpful doc you linked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-16T08:12:21] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: locally you can use them out of the box, if you want to do it remote, you have to enable remote access to the docker socket. See: [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-03-16T08:46:37] <SISheogorath> loicdescotte: My personal suggestion is: For small setups (less than 50 machines) go for swarm. For middle size setups (50-500) machines, use either K8s or swarm. Everything bigger I suggest to use K8s only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-16T08:40:07] <loicdescotte> Hi,Just a small question, if I need to define a docker network through several physical machines, is it easier to do it with Swarm or Kubernetes?
2 [2018-03-16T08:46:59] <loicdescotte> Ok thanks!
3 [2018-03-16T08:47:30] <loicdescotte> It's a 3 physical machines with 20 docker images setup
4 [2018-03-16T08:47:42] <loicdescotte> so I'll go with swarm :)
5 [2018-03-16T10:23:09] <loicdescotte> I need to run docker images on a machine that has no internet connection
6 [2018-03-16T10:23:40] <loicdescotte> is there a way to build the images (with the pull part) from another machine and then to copy the images?
7 [2018-03-16T10:25:51] <loicdescotte> small twist : the only other machine I have with internet connection is a windows one (but I can install virtualbox on it if needed)
8 [2018-03-16T10:31:49] <loicdescotte> I will go with docker save

1 [2018-03-18T08:52:55] <geekyharshal> Hi everyone
2 [2018-03-18T08:54:22] <geekyharshal> I'm new to docker, please some help in getting started.
3 [2018-03-18T08:55:10] <johannwagner> Just ask your question.
4 [2018-03-18T09:01:37] <geekyharshal> what is docker ?
5 [2018-03-18T09:02:51] <farukhkhan21_twitter> try some googling mate. [<-LINK->]
6 [2018-03-18T09:03:04] <johannwagner> You can just google this question. It is a container engine, which allows you to deploy applications in their own separate environment without sideeffects to your current system.
7 [2018-03-18T09:03:22] <johannwagner> I am not sure, if I picked the correct words.
8 [2018-03-18T09:04:04] <geekyharshal> ok, is community version enough for an individual developer ?
9 [2018-03-18T09:04:56] <farukhkhan21_twitter> even enough for production in many cases
10 [2018-03-18T09:06:37] <johannwagner> We use the Community Version for production, yes.
11 [2018-03-18T09:42:31] <geekyharshal> thanks, also, Which OS will be best suited for docker? Ubuntu or Windows ?
12 [2018-03-18T09:43:35] <johannwagner> It works for development on all OS.
13 [2018-03-18T09:43:44] <johannwagner> Production should be a Linux distro.
14 [2018-03-18T09:45:49] <geekyharshal> I can see that it works on all OS. But, I wanna know your experience. Which OS lets it run more efficiently? I work on ubuntu and windows and confused which OS to start docker with.
15 [2018-03-18T09:46:55] <johannwagner> I don’t think, there is a performance difference, which you can experience.
16 [2018-03-18T09:48:08] <geekyharshal> ok, cool... thanks :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-18T13:01:53] <deepio> Hi gang, new to this room. I’m having some issues spinning up gunicorn inside of docker when I’d like the project to be loaded up as a volume in the compose file. Also, I think my issue is escaping special characters but I can’t wrap my head around why my env_file doesn’t work on “example” the SECRET_KEY in Django?
2 [2018-03-18T13:04:46] <deepio> Ideally I’d like to use the latest versions of all these things. Specifically I’m starting from the latest alpine image.
3 [2018-03-18T13:06:39] <deepio> Once this works, I’d like to spin it all up (and nginx) with supervisord, is that ok?
4 [2018-03-18T13:26:19] <deepio> badape-net: can you post your dockerfile somewhere?
5 [2018-03-18T13:26:38] <deepio> First place I’d look is any commands or entry points
6 [2018-03-18T13:27:01] <badape-net> FROM nginx COPY ./dist /usr/share/nginx/html
7 [2018-03-18T13:34:27] <badape-net> oh i just didn't wait long enough
8 [2018-03-18T13:34:51] <badape-net> wow i had to wait 10 minutes
9 [2018-03-19T13:07:36] <deepio> Farukh: 1) why don’t you want to expose the port? 2) I think you can if you set it as a network?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-18T13:20:19] <badape-net> Hello, i am trying to build a very basic Dockerfile that copies in some static content, however i am using windows

2 [2018-03-18T15:31:00] <Leeaandrob> I am trying to set a ip static and access on chrome but i am receiving connection refused :(
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-18T15:42:21] <johannwagner> Did you expose the ports correctly ?
2 [2018-03-18T15:42:31] <Leeaandrob> yes
3 [2018-03-18T15:42:40] <Leeaandrob> but I don't to use the localhost from host machine but the ip of docker container
4 [2018-03-18T15:42:58] <Leeaandrob> I am trying to do the same usingnetwork_mode:hostbut doesn't works too!
5 [2018-03-18T15:52:13] <johannwagner> Did you try the ip from the host machine?
6 [2018-03-18T15:54:28] <Leeaandrob> yes i am trying now :)
7 [2018-03-18T15:54:34] <Leeaandrob> it's works using network_mode: host :D :D
8 [2018-03-18T15:57:06] <Leeaandrob> do you know is it possible set ip static onnetwork_mode: "bridge"@johannwagner?
9 [2018-03-18T16:09:10] <johannwagner> Leeaandrob: I think, this Stack Overflow link should help.

11 [2018-03-18T16:09:25] <johannwagner> I couldn't explain it better.
12 [2018-03-18T16:10:40] <Leeaandrob> but I think that this away I couldn't access from chrome using my host local ip
13 [2018-03-18T16:11:53] <johannwagner> Yeah, you have to create a redirect. You can do this with iptables, but I dunno how. iptables is black magic.
14 [2018-03-18T16:17:22] <Leeaandrob> yeah ip tables would be a hammer of thor!
15 [2018-03-18T16:17:39] <johannwagner> I dunno, why you would do this.
16 [2018-03-18T16:17:59] <Leeaandrob> lonnnngg history hehe
17 [2018-03-18T16:18:17] <Leeaandrob> I will work with my local host ip thanks@johannwagnerby your time!
18 [2018-03-18T16:18:38] <johannwagner> ssh -L 5000:localhost:4999 user@machinewould link the port 4999 from the machine, you ssh into, to your local port 5000.
19 [2018-03-18T16:18:43] <johannwagner> Maybe this helps.
20 [2018-03-18T16:19:00] <Leeaandrob> ssh tunnel
21 [2018-03-18T16:19:03] <johannwagner> Yep
22 [2018-03-18T16:19:03] <Leeaandrob> nice!!
23 [2018-03-18T16:19:22] <johannwagner> If you only use this for development purposes, this could work :)

1 [2018-03-19T12:32:56] <farukhkhan21_twitter> is it possible to connect to mysql port 3306 from another container without exposing the 3306 port from the mysql container docker file? exposing is exposing the port to host for outside connection or also for docker bridge network I need to expose certain port?
2 [2018-03-19T13:09:14] <farukhkhan21_twitter> I have a bridge network setup up on all my containers with static ip. I don't want to expose the mysql port to outside world through the host. I only want the httpd container to be able to access the mysql container to access databases.
3 [2018-03-19T13:12:26] <deepio> Farukh: I’m not sure, but if you find out I’d like to know too
4 [2018-03-19T13:13:33] <farukhkhan21_twitter> alright@deepio
5 [2018-03-19T13:14:36] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Nario560: not sure about the linking tag and what it actually does.
6 [2018-03-19T13:15:05] <farukhkhan21_twitter> by default when a container is spun up they all connect to default bridge0 network and gets an ip address assigned to them
7 [2018-03-19T13:15:34] <farukhkhan21_twitter> docker documentation have the links tag description there?
8 [2018-03-19T13:16:16] <farukhkhan21_twitter> Warning: The --link flag is a legacy feature of Docker. It may eventually be removed.
9 [2018-03-19T13:16:25] <farukhkhan21_twitter> but eventually it will get turned off
10 [2018-03-19T13:16:31] <farukhkhan21_twitter> so no point using this I guess
11 [2018-03-19T13:17:00] <farukhkhan21_twitter> and I think they have already deprecated the tag on version 3 yml file
12 [2018-03-19T13:21:07] <Nario560> generally
13 [2018-03-19T13:21:10] <Nario560> you can communicate
14 [2018-03-19T13:21:18] <Nario560> via docker network
15 [2018-03-19T13:21:26] <Nario560> just get internal ip
16 [2018-03-19T13:21:53] <Nario560> try running docker network inspect bridge
17 [2018-03-19T13:22:03] <Nario560> or whatever your network is called
18 [2018-03-19T13:22:38] <Nario560> you'll get container ips. Then you can try to attach to container & check connection to necessary ip manually
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-19T13:14:03] <Nario560> farukhkhan21_twitter: what about linking?
2 [2018-03-19T13:14:58] <Nario560> links 2 container without exposing ports. To make them communicate with each other
3 [2018-03-19T13:15:50] <Nario560>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2018-03-19T13:15:56] <Nario560> it's legacy but still works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-19T13:22:45] <farukhkhan21_twitter> but if I dont use the expose command on the mysql docker file will the port 3006 still be accessible from another container under the same bridge network?
2 [2018-03-19T13:26:30] <Nario560> it should be available
3 [2018-03-19T13:26:35] <Nario560> you can try it
4 [2018-03-19T13:28:43] <farukhkhan21_twitter> yeah I will be trying it now
5 [2018-03-19T14:31:00] <farukhkhan21_twitter> thanks@SISheogorathgood to know
6 [2018-03-19T17:25:02] <farukhkhan21_twitter> deepio: here is your answer   > yes, all ports of containers are accessible when they are on the same network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-19T14:29:33] <SISheogorath> yes, all ports of containers are accessible when they are on the same network
2 [2018-03-19T14:29:43] <SISheogorath> exposing is only needed for external services
3 [2018-03-19T14:31:40] <SISheogorath> and don't uselinksbecause you expose all environment variables of container A to container B which is from a security perspective pretty ugly
4 [2018-03-19T14:32:07] <farukhkhan21_twitter> that's why being deprecated I guess
5 [2018-03-19T14:34:43] <SISheogorath> that's one of many reasons, yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-20T00:15:43] <deepio> farukh: cool man! Thanks. Glad my guess was on track. I’m gonna need this soon enough

1 [2018-03-20T13:43:08] <loicdescotte> Hi ,I have a network issue with docker, I can't nderstand what is happening
2 [2018-03-20T13:43:28] <loicdescotte> I have a developpement machine , I 've made a small cluster of docker hadoop images
3 [2018-03-20T13:43:49] <loicdescotte> I've created a network, and the images can communicate through several ports
4 [2018-03-20T13:43:53] <loicdescotte> I's working perfectly
5 [2018-03-20T13:44:07] <loicdescotte> I've taken the same images, put them on another server
6 [2018-03-20T13:44:21] <loicdescotte> and there are communication issues between the images
7 [2018-03-20T13:44:31] <loicdescotte> I have  the same docker CE version on both machines
8 [2018-03-20T13:44:47] <loicdescotte> I have disabled selinux, firewalld, iptables...
9 [2018-03-20T13:45:35] <loicdescotte> Example of error : [<-CODE->]
10 [2018-03-20T13:54:11] <loicdescotte> do you know what kind of configuration issue it can be?
11 [2018-03-20T13:56:16] <loicdescotte> oups, no the Ip are NOT OK
12 [2018-03-20T13:56:35] <loicdescotte> the connection is denied with 172.18.0.1
13 [2018-03-20T13:56:58] <loicdescotte> and if I look at the Ip addresses : [<-CODE->]
14 [2018-03-20T13:57:24] <loicdescotte> but it's all dynamically generated, I don't know why it tries to connect on 172.18.0.1 ...
15 [2018-03-20T14:02:29] <loicdescotte> all ips in confugration files are defined as 0.0.0.0
16 [2018-03-20T14:22:44] <loicdescotte> or is 172.18.0.1 used by docker itself for orchestration / bridge?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-20T13:55:22] <farukhkhan21_twitter> does anyone know the difference between rancheros and coreos and racherserver?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-20T14:23:29] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: RancherOS and CoreOS, as the name indicates, are operating systems. They are optimized for container setups but I wouldn't use them at small scale. Rancher server is a management and orchestration solution for Docker. A bit like Portainer but integrated with an own orchestration solution called cattle as well as Swarm and K8s. Don't know if you want to use it… That's up to you
2 [2018-03-20T14:56:48] <SISheogorath> I would say CoreOS, when you want to do it correct, is a bit more difficult to setup. But afterwards it does everything automated and you have almost no problems.RancherOS is more beginner friendly. I'm not complete aware of their update process so can't say much about stability, but CoreOS coordinates with other cluster member (if configured correctly) so never all go down at the same time.Comparing Rancher server with K8s is like comparing a Multi-tool with a good knife. Rancher server can actually setup K8s for you. As well as it can setup Swarm for you. But these setups are maybe oversimplified which make them cause a lot of problems when you really want to scale (a few hundred nodes). And when you run into problems, you have to reverse engineer what the Rancher guys did. Cattle (rancher's own orchestrator) is fine to use but less feature rich than K8s
3 [2018-03-20T14:56:55] <SISheogorath> farukhkhan21_twitter: ^
4 [2018-03-20T14:59:07] <farukhkhan21_twitter> understood. Thanks a lot@SISheogorathfor the info

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-20T14:30:01] <farukhkhan21_twitter> So, how the rancheros and coreos basically differs? I know that rancher os have a system docker for system services. But in terms of lightweight, security and stability which one you think wins? rancheros or coreos?
2 [2018-03-20T14:30:12] <farukhkhan21_twitter> and the rancher server I can compare to K8s right?

1 [2018-03-21T19:13:40] <jmunson> I have a multistage build file that currently produces one final image containing 3 different binaries from  the same sourcecode. Is it possible to instead create 3 different final images, reusing the earlier stage?
2 [2018-03-21T19:23:05] <jmunson> Do you just keep them in separate dockerfiles and ensure the right one is built first with some kind of build script?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-21T19:56:10] <SISheogorath> jmunson: yes, you can do that, that's an easy and maybe also the only way, I guessed that you can simply reuse earlier build stages as I mentioned, by real multi-staged builds, but I'm actually not sure

1 [2018-03-23T16:31:04] <metamet> Hey all. Trying to figure out a best practice here. Wanting to use S3 to serve up some images on our containers. I've seen a couple routes to go, but it's not clear which is best practice. 1) Use S3FS on the host, then mount the path as a volume on the container, or 2) use S3FS directly on the container, mounting it there. Anyone have experience here?

1 [2018-03-26T07:00:02] <eugenepark1> how do you guys version control Dockerfiles and associating them with docker image version/tag?  and conduct some CI to verify that image built from the latest Dockerfile changes is sane
2 [2018-03-26T07:20:54] <eugenepark1> jdickey: thank you my understanding is that docker tags arent mutable so how do you prevent someone pushing their Dockerfile and building their image with the tag name v0.11.1?
3 [2018-03-26T07:21:09] <eugenepark1> is it because git version is unique?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-03-26T07:12:07] <jdickey> Version control is straightforward for us; we include the Dockerfile(s) as part of the source code repository in Git, and use Git tags to match aversionLABEL in the Dockerfile. E.g., what I'm working on now will be tagged, pushed, and deployed this afternoon asv0.11.1. That's distinct from the tags used by e.g. hub.docker.com, which are entirely separate

8 [2018-03-26T14:22:25] <azghar07> and yum doesn\'t have enough cached data to continue. At this point the onlysafe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:
9 [2018-03-26T14:22:30] <azghar07> Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.
10 [2018-03-26T14:22:36] <azghar07> Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a workingupstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newerdistribution release than is supported by the repository (and thepackages for the previous distribution release still work).
11 [2018-03-26T14:22:45] <azghar07> . Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be muchslower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nicecompromise:
12 [2018-03-26T14:22:57] <azghar07> [Errno 14] curl [<-ISSUE->] - "Could not resolve host

1 [2018-03-28T07:21:09] <joshuamanns> Question: I'm setting up a Docker project with TypeORM and have dev & production modes, and I'm using the officialpostgres:alpineimage for db. Everything is fine when the app first launches bc postgres runsinitdbwithmydb_developmentdatabase name I pass in. However, if I switch NODE_ENVs and want to use a different database likemydb_production, obviously TypeORM complains because that database doesn't exist and postgres won't auto create it because the initdb script already ran the first time. I'm not sure the best way to solve this.
2 [2018-03-28T07:21:21] <joshuamanns> Is this something that you think should be handled on the typeorm service, or should I delegate this to thepostgresservice somehow?

1 [2018-03-31T11:32:52] <PhilippHeuer> I had a pretty cool idea for a simple cli tool that allows you to define a project-specific command to docker image mapping (npm install -> redirect and run with npm:9-alpine/auto map project dir and change directory/auto expose ports) - maybe someone is interested in helping or has futher ideas? [<-LINK->] We're already using docker a lot for ci / tests / to build app artifacts - but its still missing in local development to provide node/golang/... itself.

14 [2018-04-01T22:14:02] <davidmichaelkarr> check compose file syntax. image specifies an image, not a dockerfile.
15 [2018-04-01T22:14:09] <wesleyguirra> for dev I want isolate node and its dependencies
16 [2018-04-01T22:15:26] <wesleyguirra> I tried with build

24 [2018-04-01T22:18:43] <davidmichaelkarr> construct the same image, with parameters for env config.
25 [2018-04-01T22:19:00] <wesleyguirra> have some example, repository?
26 [2018-04-01T22:19:14] <davidmichaelkarr> no. general guideline.
27 [2018-04-01T22:21:07] <wesleyguirra> when I'm in dev I need to do compose up every once I change something in the code
28 [2018-04-01T22:21:24] <wesleyguirra> even setting volumes

1 [2018-04-03T13:22:43] <sebastjan-hribar> Hi all, I have an issue with copying files from server to docker container. I used to do it withsudo docker cp my_filepath my_docker:/path_to_filebut now the command runs but doesn't copy the file. When going to container bash and cd to the folder I can't create a new file or edit an existing one. It's like I have no authorization. I'm copying some csv files for rake tasks.
2 [2018-04-03T13:45:17] <sebastjan-hribar> I found out that the server provider has performed some updates to the server and that must have caused some glitches. After stoping and starting containers everything works.

1 [2018-04-10T20:45:54] <gaggle> I\'ve smashed my head against this for 6 hours, where Docker says error of "ERROR: Preparation failed: API error (500): Get https://....amazonaws.com/v2/.../manifests/latest: no basic auth credentials" (it\'s a GitLab CI Runner pulling an AWS ECS image). But everything works when I SSH into the runner, I candocker pullthat same image no problem. Can anyone explain what "no basic auth credentials" actually refer to?
2 [2018-04-10T20:52:04] <gaggle> I put Docker host into debug mode, but all I see there are entries like "Handler for POST /v1.18/images/create returned error: Get https://....amazonaws.com/v2/.../manifests/latest: no basic auth credentials"It\'s been frustrating to debug because SSH just works, and the runner is fine pulling publicly available images. Not sure what that basic auth refers to... is the Docker host expecting auth but not getting them? Or that it doesn\'t want them? Is it the host itself that has credentials or the caller?
3 [2018-04-10T20:54:42] <gaggle> (Since this is ECS I\'ve made sure to get login to it viaaws ecr get-login, and everything works brilliantly from SSH.. I\'ve almost given up but if someone knows what "no basic auth" refers to maybe I can think of more things to try)
4 [2018-04-10T20:56:01] <gaggle> Oh if its relevant this is AWS EC2 Linux, w. docker.x86_64 17.12.1ce-1.135.amzn1 installed according to yum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-12T13:21:48] <conkerant> stephenchu: check your user ID into container (you must be root to use docker socket)
2 [2018-04-12T13:22:17] <conkerant> stephenchu: or any user who authorised to use docker socket.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-12T13:38:01] <FlorinAsavoaie> stephenchu: that's because /var/run/docker.sock is from Moby VM which is running the Docker daemon and SSH_AUTH_SOCK is from OSX.
2 [2018-04-12T13:39:00] <FlorinAsavoaie> On OSX, Docker runs in a virtual machine created with HyperKit over the OSX  Hypervisor, not natively like in Linux.

4 [2018-04-13T14:25:42] <siulkilulki> actually i m trying to recreate it with named volume mounted in the same location, should also work, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-13T14:23:25] <SISheogorath> From inside a container, no way, from outside: recreate thr container without the mount. No other way advised

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-14T09:36:02] <chwba> how can i effectively update a docker container like this?
2 [2018-04-14T09:36:07] <chwba>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-04-14T09:36:46] <chwba> i simply want it to rerun the dockerfile, so that it will download the most recent version of lms through the flexible link embedded in it
4 [2018-04-14T09:53:29] <SISheogorath> looks fine, yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-14T12:09:20] <babaorum> I do not think you can "update" a container per say. You have to kill it and recreate it using the updated image
2 [2018-04-14T13:53:04] <babaorum> I thnik you should schedule a pull of the image and be able to catch a change. This way you will avoid killing / recreating the container for nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-14T13:49:52] <PhilippHeuer> ye, just make sure to store your critical data outside of the container with mounts - so that you can recreate them at any time and keep your data
2 [2018-04-14T13:53:56] <PhilippHeuer> yepp that should be part of this external script
3 [2018-04-14T13:55:23] <PhilippHeuer> what do you use? cli commands, docker compose or some orchestrator?
4 [2018-04-14T13:55:33] <chwba> cli commands
5 [2018-04-14T13:56:36] <chwba> so if i only had this one container runing i would do something like: docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)  docker rmi $(docker images -q) and then docker pull 'name'
6 [2018-04-14T13:58:51] <PhilippHeuer> you can give your container a name with --name hello and then use that when you stop/kill
7 [2018-04-14T13:59:04] <PhilippHeuer> and you don't have to call rmi before pulling
8 [2018-04-14T14:02:48] <PhilippHeuer> if you only have a single server you could use docker swarm and replace your docker run command with a compose yml file, then you would only pull the new image and redeploy the service withdocker stack deploy --compose-file mediaserver.yml- if you post your run command i can give you a example
9 [2018-04-14T14:03:24] <PhilippHeuer> but you should never write a cronjob that stops all containers like that, at some point when you add others you'r gonna be in for a surprise - always name them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-14T13:51:07] <chwba> so if I wanted to make sure the container is always up to date I would have to schedule an external script that regularly kills the container and then recreates it?
2 [2018-04-14T13:51:55] <PhilippHeuer> yes

2 [2018-04-14T19:01:12] <babaorum> It should look like this :

1 [2018-04-15T16:30:19] <nspaeth> Hi. I am trying to move a container to a different host. At first I trieddocker exportanddocker import, but I discovered that this method removes meta data about e.g., theRUN, and trying to run it givesno command specified. I found out aboutdocker save, which is supposed to save that meta data, but that appears to save the image, not the container. What if I have data I want to preserve in the container and preserve the meta data?

1 [2018-04-16T16:23:48] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Hi
2 [2018-04-16T16:24:54] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Iam struggling with a small issue. Iam trying to install a software called ImageMagick to access in my java application.
3 [2018-04-16T16:25:56] <MohanJagadheeswaran> \'\'\'FROM openjdk:8ADD target/eureka-server-1.0.0-RELEASE.jar eureka-server-1.0.0-RELEASE.jarEXPOSE 9991RUN ["yum","install","ImageMagick"]RUN [COMMAND TO SET env Variable]ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","eureka-server-1.0.0-RELEASE.jar"]\'\'\'
4 [2018-04-16T16:26:56] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Iam not sure whether, how to set my application directory as a environmental variable
5 [2018-04-16T16:27:18] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Once i set, in my java application, i will be using it
6 [2018-04-16T16:27:33] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Suggest a solution for my problem
7 [2018-04-16T16:28:22] <MohanJagadheeswaran> I found whereis command helps to find installation directory of ImagaMagick
8 [2018-04-16T16:39:18] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Thank for your reply
9 [2018-04-16T16:39:21] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Hope env safes me
10 [2018-04-16T16:39:50] <MohanJagadheeswaran> But what am scared is, i need to get the installation directory of my yum install command
11 [2018-04-16T16:39:56] <MohanJagadheeswaran> then set to my env dynamically
12 [2018-04-16T16:40:26] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Guess whereis helps in getting installation directory
13 [2018-04-16T16:40:33] <babaorum> I think you can do that.
14 [2018-04-16T16:40:38] <MohanJagadheeswaran> but can i save it in a variable, some thing like that?
15 [2018-04-16T16:42:35] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Guess exact solution i needed. can i try with $(whereis my-soft)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-16T16:35:31] <babaorum> If you only need within your dockerfile consider using ARG ( [<-LINK->] ).If you need it while running you application, you can use ENV ( [<-LINK->] )
2 [2018-04-16T16:39:52] <babaorum> But I am not sure if you can surcharge the value of ENV during the build.
3 [2018-04-16T16:41:37] <babaorum> something like that should work I think ENV INSTALL_PATH = $(which my-soft)
4 [2018-04-16T16:43:31] <babaorum> Give it a try. In both cases, I am interested in the result
5 [2018-04-16T16:46:25] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Lest give a shot!!
6 [2018-04-16T18:38:38] <MohanJagadheeswaran> babaorum: Iam facing this error

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-16T19:23:42] <babaorum> From what I saw, the tag you are refering is not an image which use yum as it's package manager. It use apt-get.
2 [2018-04-16T19:24:25] <babaorum> You should either change your tag. Or use apt-get instead of yum
3 [2018-04-16T19:25:43] <babaorum> Also do not forget to pass an option to avoid a prompt before the install. For apt-get it is achieve with -y
4 [2018-04-17T12:11:04] <babaorum> kminevskiy: can you show us what your docker-compose file looks like
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-16T23:50:54] <kminevskiy> Hey folks, hope y\'all having great day/evening! I\'m working on configuring dev env for my team and I\'m packaging several services into Docker containers. It looks like I\'m almost there, but the problem I\'m having is the following: I have 3 services (app, db and redis). The last 2 will need to be accessible from the first one (app). As far as I understand, by default all of them live on the same virtual network and be able to communicate. So I use <links> directive under the app service to explicitly define that fact. However, when I try to ping / connect to the database container, I get "could not translate host name "postgres.local" to address: Name or service not known". Is there something I\'m missing?
2 [2018-04-16T23:52:17] <kminevskiy> My assumption was that Docker will automatically add postgres.local (alias I defined in the Docker Compose file) to my app service and that container will be able to resolve the hostname.
3 [2018-04-17T04:53:03] <MohanJagadheeswaran> babaorum: you are right. I changed my DockerFile as below
4 [2018-04-17T04:53:12] <MohanJagadheeswaran> '''FROM openjdk:8downloading imagemagick dependenciesRUN apt-get install build-essential checkinstall && apt-get build-dep imagemagick -ydownloading imagemagick and configuringRUN wget http://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz'''
5 [2018-04-17T04:54:26] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Now am getting unable to locate package build essential and check essential
6 [2018-04-17T04:54:39] <MohanJagadheeswaran> returned a non zero code-100
7 [2018-04-17T04:54:49] <MohanJagadheeswaran> Checking the issue.
8 [2018-04-17T14:25:41] <kminevskiy> babaorum: I just realized that I was expecting hostnames to be available during container (Dockerfile) creation. And obviously that's not the case.
9 [2018-04-17T14:26:03] <kminevskiy> So I guess my question is resolved :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-17T18:43:08] <rightisleft> why did they remove scale from docker-compose?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-18T10:18:09] <akso-ak> Hi. I am trying to run a container that has an environment variable which is a password that contains special characters. Is there any documentation on how to properly escape these chars?
2 [2018-04-23T09:46:46] <akso-ak> SISheogorath: Thanks. I have resolved the issue now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-18T16:32:38] <SISheogorath> @akso-akThat depends on how you want to use them. In general you have to escape them for your shell when you put them in using the docker command or for yaml when you use docker-compose. Also you may use a third format later on in your image, where you may have to escape it differently. But that's something only you know
2 [2018-04-18T16:33:11] <SISheogorath> Also keep in mind that some characters may cause problems when you don't use UTF-8 or different locales in general

1 [2018-04-18T18:46:08] <farukhkhan21_twitter> is it ok to create a docker swarm cluster with one swarm manager on docker version 18.03 and 5 worker nodes on docker version 17.12.1? The manager is only manager and not working on the cluster.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-18T19:22:46] <rusbob> farukhkhan21_twitter: Not a reliable option, but possible one. You need just to make sure, there is nothing could break compatibility between these two versions. Check diff of two versions release notes:v. 17.12.1: [<-LINK->] v. 18.03: [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-04-18T22:45:51] <intellix> am I right in thinking that Docker reads.gitignoreand doesn't copy stuff across that are defined there?
2 [2018-04-18T22:47:09] <intellix> because if that's so, I'm so mad. Spent hours to realise that it reads something that has nothing to do with Docker
3 [2018-04-18T22:48:18] <davidmichaelkarr> intellix: I doubt that. I believe there's a different file with a similar purpose.
4 [2018-04-18T22:48:44] <intellix> I know there's a.dockerignore, I'm doing multi-stage builds and when I copy across from the multi-stage, the output isn't in the second step

6 [2018-04-18T22:50:22] <intellix> the yarn in the first step runs lerna bootstrap, which compiles my code. In the 2nd step, the dist folders are just not there
7 [2018-04-18T22:50:23] <davidmichaelkarr> intellix: docket isn't going to look at that. it would use .dockerignore, so something else is going on.
8 [2018-04-18T22:50:39] <intellix> so confused :'(

I already tried--restart always

4 [2018-04-20T13:48:52] <davidmichaelkarr> Maxdu92: do you need it to have a particular name?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-21T19:58:17] <rusbob> Hi@Maxdu92, not clear what you're trying to achieve with this pipeline. It looks like the pipeline job tries to run container instead to make sure the container is down before running it.
2 [2018-04-23T08:23:55] <rusbob> MichaelrMentele: I think you need to havewebentries with different ports and then you'll be able to run multiple containers inhostnetworking.
3 [2018-04-23T08:42:10] <rusbob> Hi@xximjasonxx, why not run bothexpress.jsandReactframework atNodeJSon single container?In case you need a separate solution,  you can add a reverse proxy (nginx) in front of external requests and it will dispatches all those requests to the corresponding container, eitherLogin(express.js) orWebReact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-21T22:59:06] <PhilippHeuer> He prob. wants to deploy his container in the pipeline. You will have to remove your old container first before you use docker run
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-22T00:36:51] <justinhj> Maxdu92: if you want to remove the container before  making a new one with the same name you can do that like thisdocker rm -f juice-shop || true

I have my own Swarm cluster setup on Ec2 instances, provisioned with tform and will bootstrap on launch to join an existing cluster of EC2 instances.  Just wondering if anyone has experience or recommendation on a registry for a 6-12 node cluster to pull from. ECR backed by AWS S3 seems to be the easiest solution at first
2 [2018-04-26T22:40:01] <briantyr> Another option is to run the official registry backed by S3 on multiple nodes in the cluster, or something like gitlab maybe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2018-04-27T03:57:21] <zebralight> hello. I was wondering if I have port 5432 already used for my system postgresql server and I want to use the same port for one of my docker containers as specified in my docker-compose.yml, would I be able to configure it such that an available port can be selected automatically without breaking the compose?
2 [2018-05-02T05:15:32] <zebralight> hello. I don't fully understand what a container is, since I initially imagined it to be something that only exists when running an image and goes away upon stopping it.  That's why the idea of a stopped container is confusing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-27T11:44:44] <roychri> farukhkhan21_twitter: That really depends on the kind if load you will need, and your budget.
2 [2018-04-27T11:46:30] <roychri> zebralight: You can have different containers listening on the same port internally since they are isolated with namespace. However, you cannot map a container to a port on your host which is already being used on your host. So if you have postgres running in your host and listening to port 5432, you cannot have a containers which have its internal port mapped to port 5432 on your host at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-27T19:42:03] <roychri> farukhkhan21_twitter: It depends on so much factors like (are you going to run one container per machine? Are you expecting much traffic? What's your budget? Did you benchmark your app to see if its more CPU or Memory hungry?).  In the end, you have to make the call. I certainly wont pick the hardware for you! :)

1 [2018-04-29T21:23:35] <nb9791_twitter> Hello everyone, I would like to ask if it is possible to build a docker infrastructure and allow my friends to run their containers? Do I need to give them admin access or is there a way to do it without giving them full access to my machine
2 [2018-04-30T06:30:12] <nb9791_twitter> mateothegreat: Thank you very much
3 [2018-04-30T07:37:51] <nb9791_twitter> I have a use case in which I have installed Docker and I want to allow users to run their containers without having the root access. Each user should be able to have access only to their container. I will be acting as a docker engine provider and the users will act as clients that run their containers. Do you think that this is possible? If so can you please direct me to some examples. Thank you
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-04-30T18:40:00] <SOSC20_twitter> Yes you can  ive seen examples of this on Docker forums online. Particulary between Windows dockers
2 [2018-04-30T18:44:10] <SOSC20_twitter> I've seen a great app on android store called docker tutorial it mentions docker volumes on there too
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-05-02T06:21:48] <babaorum> zebralight: there is a little more to it. Compared to your image, your container can have special "configuration" like extra environment variables or a custom run command, or a volume, etc. Stopping a container, is keeping all those informations.

1 [2018-05-07T06:51:15] <jasperf> Does anyone have an example how to load an ssl cert off a volume?
2 [2018-05-07T06:54:57] <jasperf> johannwagner: well, for a new production setup with commercial wildcard I would like the nginx container to load the cert off the host when possible. So I am looking for the best way to do this is the nginx Docker file. Thought of connecting host to container and store cert on the host, but not sure if that is the best way and how I would do this
3 [2018-05-07T06:58:06] <jasperf> Aha. Yeah, an example would be great. I also understood mounting is not the same as using volumes and that the latter might be better? Still learning.. Anyways. Look forward to example so I can understand it all better.
4 [2018-05-07T07:00:12] <jasperf> See also my remarks on it at [<-ISSUE->] where they were discussing a similar setup..
5 [2018-05-07T07:04:28] <johannwagner> Mounting a volume into a Docker container means using a volume. Sorry for Inconvenience.
6 [2018-05-07T07:17:10] <jasperf> Aha OK. Thanks@johannwagner. Looking forward to the example

2 [2018-05-07T06:56:02] <johannwagner> You can mount in the folder with the certificate anywhere in the nginx-Container and load it from file system as normal with the nginx.conf.
3 [2018-05-07T06:56:46] <johannwagner> I can give you an example in 30m, on mobile right now.

1 [2018-05-09T09:19:29] <empwilli> Hi folks, I ran into some trouble with my setup (which usually works quite fine), hope someone can help me
2 [2018-05-09T09:20:25] <empwilli> In a nutshell, I've got a virtual bridge device with some containers and a single container with apache which plays as a reverse proxy to these containers
3 [2018-05-09T09:20:34] <empwilli> This container is bound to the hosts ports
4 [2018-05-09T09:21:09] <empwilli> In my setup I rely on the fact that (in principle) all containers may reach themselves via their hostnames
5 [2018-05-09T09:21:48] <empwilli> However, I've ran into trouble with one specific container now from time to time and as i've found after some restarts, docker inspect shows that it has another IP than a ping from the apache container
6 [2018-05-09T09:21:49] <empwilli> :/
7 [2018-05-09T09:22:10] <empwilli> I hope this was clear enough, otherwise I'm glad to clarify some details ;)
8 [2018-05-09T09:24:26] <empwilli> Strange enough, the other containers seem to resolve the address correctly (docker exec A ping -c 3 Target vs. docker exec apache2 ping -c 3 Target)
9 [2018-05-09T09:29:08] <empwilli> If I query docker network inspect I get the IP address, returned by docker inspect Target (not the one apache2 tries to ping to)
10 [2018-05-09T09:39:23] <empwilli> Aaah, I might have found the error. I copy-paste-reused my docker-compose files and the service names of the unreachable container and another container (the one whos IP address is wrongly resolved) match.. idk why both compose files work after all
11 [2018-05-09T09:39:24] <empwilli> :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-05-09T10:36:38] <carlosjgp> mohamedaittaleb: Then you have to install an ssh server and configure your keys on it, like you would do with a VM.

1 [2018-05-11T12:31:44] <ptink> is baking code into an image(s) generally better than using volumes? I have a repo that contains both static files (that I'd like to bake into the nginx image) and webserver code (that I'd like to bake into the webapp image) but I'm struggling to think of a good way to create two images from one command (and be able to tag them with the same release)
2 [2018-05-11T12:32:14] <ptink> i was looking at multi-stage builds but that just creates one image at the end
3 [2018-05-11T12:32:41] <ptink> and I'll have an app container and an nginx container
4 [2018-05-15T12:02:14] <ptink> if I have a collection of static files to serve via nginx, but I also wish to use nginx as a reverse proxy for my webapp (potentially in a different repository) is it best to have 2 separate nginx images and therefore containers running?
5 [2018-05-15T12:02:50] <ptink> otherwise I worry that I have to store e.g. the config for the webapp portion of nginx in the repo with the static files
6 [2018-05-15T12:15:59] <ptink> I'm not sure I follow, so you have two separate nginx images/containers?

1 [2018-05-15T02:24:19] <jasperf> Found [<-LINK->] that prepares the playground for Docker using an Ansible playgroup. Very useful. But what it misses is an example Ansible setup and the playbook to push Docker files into the host machine after the preparation. Anyone found playbooks for that?

1 [2018-05-15T12:07:02] <marcko> I use nginx as a reverse proxy and nginx or apache in the container. works for me.
2 [2018-05-15T12:21:43] <marcko> yes. I think it's better to have each service in a container and use nginx as a reverse proxy. but I'm probably wrong

1 [2018-05-16T06:38:37] <ManikantThakur> Greetings Everyone! I am stuck with the common problem that a dockerized nginx running in the proxied mode, does not pass client's real IP to subsequent containers.
2 [2018-05-16T06:41:13] <ManikantThakur> Deviad: How about mapping your vhost.conf as well? I mean make use of volume, and mark the file as ReadOnly(RO). So the file modification can be only one way. Containers consuming vhost.conf cannot modify the files content, it can only read it. Make the changes on the host machine, restart the web container, and your web container will spin up with new conf.

Docker Network and System/Host network are two completely different network. Try creating one more container and front this container, access you new container, assuming you have named the new container as node_container, like curl [<-LINK->] . You should see the response because both are running on the same network, docker network.

1 [2018-05-24T12:00:12] <deepio> General question, I’m training a CNN in a specific docker service, the service crashes as the swap memory gets full. It’s like if it stores everything from each epoch of the CNN instead of automatically deleting what isn’t used anymore. Are there settings I need to expose for a sort of autoclean to happen?
2 [2018-05-28T16:51:14] <deepio> kongakong: yes the CNN works fine outside of docker.
3 [2018-05-28T16:51:59] <deepio> Swap memory fills up and the docker container crashes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2018-05-26T17:26:47] <WolfspiritM> I have a very strange behaviour and was wondering if that\'s supposed to happen. I have a docker-compose project that contains a service called "identity" and a service called "api". They both are linked via an internal network. Also I have an external network called "proxy" for a reverse proxy which is also connected to both of them. Then I do a "docker stack deploy ... dev" and a "docker stack deploy ... prod" which results in dev_api and prod_api. When I then do a call to " [<-LINK->] " from within dev_identity I sometimes end up on the prod_api container so the service discovery is cross-stack somehow through the proxy network. Any idea how I can fix that without having to explicitly call dev_api from within the container?

2 [2018-05-29T20:57:14] <deepio> nickvermeer: use docker-compose. Definitely recommended. As you grow, use Kubernetes instead of swarm. That will allow you to orchestrate turning down machines for 24/7 up-time.
3 [2018-05-29T20:57:58] <deepio> zillerium: short answer, yes.
4 [2018-05-30T00:46:36] <deepio> hwkd: I never said it was better or worst. Kubernetes is more of an industry standard. It will be more helpful job wise if you work with that one anyway. Many companies are backing it, being open sourced from google after all.

2 [2018-05-30T00:38:06] <hwkd> better than swarm?
3 [2018-05-30T00:40:55] <hwkd> swarm also has a mechanism called "desired state reconciliation" to ensure that your containers are in the desired state (according to your specs) which means your containers will be up 24/7 unless you specify otherwise.

1 [2018-05-30T10:40:53] <empwilli> are you certain that you have assigned a tag on building?

1 [2018-06-04T14:30:13] <papaiatis> Hi guys. Any idea why creating the layers takes way too much time?Even the WORKDIR command takes around 60 seconds to finish.Is it because my build context is 282MB?

1 [2018-06-05T03:58:32] <mateothegreat> that's kinda big

1 [2018-06-05T21:38:06] <SalathielGenese> Hi everyone,
2 [2018-06-05T21:38:29] <SalathielGenese> I'm glad to join this room
3 [2018-06-05T21:38:57] <SalathielGenese> So, naturally I'm coming with a question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-05T22:45:01] <stantonxu> withcd /ci-cd-build-pubsub, you just move to that folder for following commands in the Dockerfile. if you don’t setWORKDIR, by default it is/

1 [2018-06-06T00:17:43] <lukepighetti> Hey guys, where's the best place to ask beginner questions?
2 [2018-06-06T00:19:57] <lukepighetti> I have an express app that runs fine withnode app.json port 8081, but when I launch it with docker-compose and expose port 8081 I cannot access it
3 [2018-06-06T00:20:11] <lukepighetti> I have tried explicitly listening on0.0.0.0and no luck
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-06T03:49:54] <puxos> try ports instead of expose [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-06T06:03:46] <jdevillard> Hello guys , have you some best practices or framework to manage docker container from a container ( to create new container instance depending functionnal requirement or to start small process with small duration and with specific configuration ) (like poll a specific queue for 5 min)
2 [2018-06-06T06:37:33] <jdevillard> puxos: , thanks for the answer,  I know certains of this tools and it could be usefull to not have to reimplement RBAC to deploy new container.  But indeed, I've to implement my own logic, so now I can launch my dev! thx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-06T06:32:48] <puxos> jdevillard: 3 suggestions.try out some container orchestration tools, like portainer, shipyard, kubernetes, etc. Those tools could run as a container to manage other containers, see if it satisfies you.\nFor only small and specific tasks like start several containers to queue for 5 mins, you could use some automation system, such as Rundeck, create your scheduler and fire the task towards docker’s api to get things done.\nif 1 & 2 cannot solve the problem, you might need to write some plugins stuff on existing orchestration tools or on your own system, and likely need more efforts.

1 [2018-06-06T06:37:26] <aliuk2012> hi, I seem to have a lot of /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt and /var/lib/docker/containers using up a lot of space. They seem to be from previous older containers that no longer available. How do I remove these old mounted volumes?
2 [2018-06-06T06:39:56] <ShazIndia> aliuk2012: have you deleted the old container

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-08T13:43:14] <kelley999> Hi, anyone know how use host variable or command result in Dockerfile?
2 [2018-06-08T13:44:04] <kelley999> i want to add same user as host while building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-09T02:16:55] <puxos> @kelley999 Try —build-argIn Dockerfile, write ARGs you want to pass in like below: [<-CODE->] and then build the image with —build-arg as following: [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-06-09T02:18:25] <puxos> you can use myVar in Dockerfile as ${myVar}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-12T18:14:39] <QubitGG> Hey all! I'm trying to create a new container and connect it to an existing container, but I can't seem to get it right... [<-CODE->] I'm trying to get the new container to talk to the mongo container that is already running on the 'app-net' network, but I can't seem to get it right... What am I doing wrong here?
2 [2018-06-12T18:17:29] <QubitGG> I can connect to the mongo container from the host terminal, so I don't think that is the issue.
3 [2018-06-12T20:17:09] <QubitGG> alternatively (and preferably) how might I do it in a docker-compose.yml? [<-CODE->] still didn't work... [<-CODE->] is what I end up.
4 [2018-06-12T20:17:35] <QubitGG> And yes, setting the local port to 37017 is intentional
5 [2018-06-12T23:19:10] <QubitGG> DinoSourcesRex: I'm not sure what you mean by seed. Could you explain?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-12T19:09:35] <papaiatis> Hi all! I\'d like to automate a docker build process to run every day that creates fresh images from our software.How can I make sure that docker build always pulls down the latest base image? It\'s tagged  "ubuntu:rolling".Should I just delete this image before calling docker build ?
2 [2018-06-14T09:24:45] <papaiatis> so that dockerfile should work just fine on your another linux host if the image is correctly defined in the FROM clause
3 [2018-06-14T09:25:33] <papaiatis> like  FROM myprivateregistry/my-own-imagewhere myprivateregistry points to your host where the registry runs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-12T22:54:26] <DinoSourcesRex>  [<-CODE->] That's a docker-compose I have that builds an image to seed my mongodb.@QubitGG
2 [2018-06-12T23:26:13] <DinoSourcesRex> QubitGG: The purpose of the image isn't really relevant to the example of interconnectability however it basically calls mongorestore and restores an existing backup into an empty mongodb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-12T22:57:39] <justinhj> papaiatis: our work flow for this is to just destroy the container if it is running and start it again. Docker should download the updated image if it has changed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-12T23:32:38] <QubitGG> after reading through [<-LINK->] I understand a little better. But I'm still left a little curious, is seeding required to make the link work?
2 [2018-06-13T12:33:35] <QubitGG> bboyle1234: thank you! The problem was that I was actually using the wrong container name for my mongo container. This is an excellent piece of reference though, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-13T05:30:22] <bboyle1234> QubitGG: , here is an example docker-compose.yml file that I use successfully with mongo. Some notes:MongoExpress lets you view the mongo db (very helpful)\nI think your problem probably lies in not specifying the correct port in your mongodb connection string, since you're using a non-standard port. See my example of a correctly-formatted connecdtion string and use it, just modify the port.\nNo need for you to specify the external default networks. The compose file will run well without the networks section. I use it because I have a couple of docker-compose files that I like to run during dev that need to talk to each others' containers, so I put both on the external dev network. [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-06-14T09:49:18] <bboyle1234> it's my dev machine docker file ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-13T18:01:31] <brjadams> so I have an image, it's building and pushing to my private registry. Now I want to run an instance of that image/container on another linux host. This is where I'm having some hangups about the best way to do this. I have a dockerfile, as well as a docker compose that works when I run on my local machine.
2 [2018-06-14T14:50:34] <brjadams> so, are compose files only really meant for local machines?
3 [2018-06-14T14:50:52] <brjadams> I have a compose, which runs my app, memcached, and postgres server locally, just fine.
4 [2018-06-14T14:51:17] <brjadams> I've got the build process figured out, and I'm pushing an image to a private remote registry.
5 [2018-06-14T14:51:34] <brjadams> I want to now have another remote machine run that image as a container.
6 [2018-06-14T15:33:18] <brjadams> problem is, it's in the project path, and uses sh files and such to build and execute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-14T13:25:46] <alex-ppg> Hey guys, quick question.
2 [2018-06-14T13:26:01] <alex-ppg> I'm having an issue with executing a command inside a container.
3 [2018-06-14T13:28:36] <alex-ppg> If I run: [<-CODE->] And then on the bash shell of the container I run my command it works correctly with no issues. However, if I do this: [<-CODE->] It fails to execute correctly. I have even tried using a workaround in the following way: [<-CODE->] and [<-CODE->] With both failing because the container is not TTY while executing the standalone command works.Any ideas?
4 [2018-06-14T13:30:39] <alex-ppg> To clarify, the command itself is not failing, it throws an error that otherwise does not appear by executing it directly. [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-14T15:00:53] <papaiatis> a compose file is used to run multiple containers in one stepyou can copy this file anywhere you want and execute it there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-15T03:03:59] <mateothegreat> brjadams: you could set your DOCKER_HOST environment variable and communicate with the remote machines docker daemon directly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2018-06-15T20:30:51] <CuddleBunny> hey folks, I am getting started with docker today with Windows containers and can't figure out why loop back isn't working. Apparently it was fixed in the Windows 10 April update, which I have (v 17134.112) but I can only access my containers via ip and not localhost.
2 [2018-06-15T20:31:22] <CuddleBunny> docker itself is v 18.03.1-ce-win65
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-15T20:56:49] <CuddleBunny> eh, looks like this is a "known issue" even if it\'s fixed in Windows... does anyone have insight on this?

1 [2018-06-16T21:29:21] <DinoSourcesRex> A very basic question: if I start a container what happens when I:a) exit dockerb) turn off / restart the host machineDo the containers restart when docker starts up again the next time, data intact?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-17T15:18:50] <kylegordon_twitter> DinoSourcesRex: if you exit docker, as in stop the docker process, your containers will exit
2 [2018-06-17T15:19:10] <kylegordon_twitter> if you restart the machine, the behaviour of the container will depend on the restart policy applied to the container
3 [2018-06-17T15:19:25] <kylegordon_twitter> I often have 'unless-stopped' as my restart policy, so they will start back up automatically
4 [2018-06-17T15:19:35] <kylegordon_twitter> unless, of course, I have manually stopped them with docker stop foo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-17T16:07:29] <DinoSourcesRex> kylegordon_twitter: Thanks for the info. I'll probably have to play around a little to check the behaviour myself. I've got a DB container and a DB seed container and want to know how it will behave under certain circumstances.

1 [2018-06-20T09:31:03] <papayuca> Hey guys, I just started with docker and would have very dumm beginner question. When I make an image for my app, how do I go about after updating the app code? Do I build the image again or what is a common practice for this process? Generally how to go about with docker when developing?
2 [2018-06-20T09:53:04] <rcjsuen> papayuca: YMMV > should includedocker buildin your CI pipeline.
3 [2018-06-20T09:53:19] <rcjsuen> when you release changes to your branch, it'll build > tag > push
4 [2018-06-20T09:53:49] <rcjsuen> what I do is tag every build with my Git commit SHA-1 (and of course also tagginglatest)
5 [2018-06-20T09:53:57] <rcjsuen> Although of courselatestis not the greatest of tags
6 [2018-06-20T09:54:14] <rcjsuen> when I finally release a version I manually tag and push (of course that can be CI-automated also)
7 [2018-06-20T15:11:43] <rcjsuen> Almost sounds like you should use that as the base stage of the other ones...
8 [2018-06-20T15:12:10] <danielo515> I was thinking that
9 [2018-06-20T15:12:36] <danielo515> In fact if I use it for copying files it works perfectly, files are persisted
10 [2018-06-20T15:13:05] <danielo515> But, I want certain packages available on the final image without all the overhead and temp files that apt-get update generates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2018-06-21T15:45:03] <liwenjun1988> Hi everyone, I'm new to docker world. I want to use gitlab to build a docker image. May I ask if anyone knows if multiple docker files can be hosted in the same project or need to be kept in different project? Thanks!
2 [2018-06-21T15:46:04] <rcjsuen> Dockerfiles are just files, you can have as many of them as you want
3 [2018-06-21T15:46:16] <rcjsuen> I think you might want to rephrase your question or state what you want to achieve.
4 [2018-06-21T15:54:05] <liwenjun1988> Sorry my question is a little bit vague. Basically I put a dockerfile in a gitlab project, and use a gitlab-ci.yaml to build the image. so I can use gitlab.com:[port][/path]:master as docker image. Now I want to create a second docker image, and not sure if i can put it in the same project.
5 [2018-06-21T16:57:51] <liwenjun1988> Right.
6 [2018-06-21T17:46:28] <liwenjun1988> Sure, i think it might be the possible approach for me to put them in different folders and modify gitlab-ci.yaml file to build/push them all. Thanks!@rcjsuen
7 [2018-06-21T17:48:17] <rcjsuen> OK, good luck!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-21T16:13:33] <rcjsuen> Hm, sounds like you are using GitLab as your registry for Docker images instead of Docker Hub, correct?
2 [2018-06-21T17:05:36] <rcjsuen> Well, I feel like a registry and a Git repository shouldn't really be related.
3 [2018-06-21T17:05:56] <rcjsuen> You could check with the GitLab folks. But certainly I can have a folder of 3 Dockerfiles and build, tag, and push them all to Docker Hub anyway.

I have a noob question about docker-machine: I configured my first (existing) host (google cloud compute vm instance) with it, the host had a couple containers running on it, after configuring it with docker machine (from my laptop) every container and every image was removed, does docker-machine cause a re-provision of the instance?

1 [2018-06-22T11:53:01] <SalathielGenese> I want to fix a pixel-like detail now,I'm mounting some GCloud credentials' file in docker-compose volumes. Mounting project folder for reasons above described now have that file in my host project folder. It also hapen that many dev are working on the same project, each having its own Google Service Account credential file, with different credentials. My question is whether I can mount that credential file into docker container and not have it on my host.I know I can git ignore for each of us working on it with each ones disctinct file name but would like to have a higher level and more elegant solution, regardless of who work on the project or rename its credentials' file.Thank You Very Much.
2 [2018-06-22T12:02:42] <SalathielGenese> May be I ought to provide example - [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
3 [2018-06-22T12:22:03] <SalathielGenese> When applying the previous technique, I get that file:empty on host\nfilled in containerThis just not enough

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-25T11:46:05] <etherealjoy> How can I switch  dockerd to fully HTTP operation without setting the registry as insecure. We need this because we are sitting behind a proxy and we don't want to reload the daemon whenever we need to deploy something new from another registry
2 [2018-06-25T11:46:51] <etherealjoy> We have our own Registry and the proxy is handling the job of authentication and other things
3 [2018-06-25T13:21:35] <etherealjoy> Linux or windows?
4 [2018-06-25T13:21:56] <bizmate> linux

6 [2018-06-25T13:35:09] <etherealjoy> do /proc/pid/status

1 [2018-06-25T13:13:01] <bizmate> hi folks, what are the best metrics to consider for your container footprint in terms of memory, cpu etc
2 [2018-06-25T13:13:11] <bizmate> how would you measure it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-25T14:55:52] <scheiblr> Hi I just used a docker image with latest and now wanted to use an older version of it. When I run it using docker-compose up, I get [<-CODE->] How can I remove all that old content and start new from 0?
2 [2018-06-26T08:45:28] <scheiblr> got it, was something different..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T08:46:39] <gabegm> Hi there!I am trying to create a docker image to run a flask web app but I also need to run a python script on the side which uses a scheduler so the script is always running.From what I’ve seen it’s not possible to have docker run both the flask app and the python scheduler together.Is there a better way to do this?
2 [2018-06-26T12:17:13] <gabegm> how would that work exactly?I currently have a dockerfile which sets everything up and runs gunicorn to start the web serverhow would I be able to have another container which can access the sqlite db file from the first container?
3 [2018-06-26T12:18:39] <gabegm> sqlite is just a file tho, so it doesn’t need its own container
4 [2018-06-26T12:19:21] <gabegm> so how would I do this? create a seperate dockerfile and share the same volume between both containers?
5 [2018-06-26T12:20:09] <gabegm> can docker-compose automatically run both dockerfiles?
6 [2018-06-26T12:20:26] <bizmate> yes
7 [2018-06-26T12:20:29] <bizmate> thats the point
8 [2018-06-26T12:20:29] <bizmate>  [<-LINK->]
9 [2018-06-26T12:20:56] <bizmate> see how i run all the separate containers for this sample rabbitmq apps powered with php
10 [2018-06-26T12:21:09] <gabegm> also, since it’s a seperate dockerfile, do I need to recreate the anaconda (python) environment I would have created in the other dockerfile?
11 [2018-06-26T12:21:36] <gabegm> bizmate: oh cool you can link to the dockerfile!
12 [2018-06-26T12:21:40] <bizmate> i must say I am not familiar with pythons architecture
13 [2018-06-26T12:21:47] <bizmate> the docker files are there
14 [2018-06-26T12:21:49] <bizmate> see the paths
15 [2018-06-26T12:22:26] <gabegm> okay I’ll give it a go!thanks for the help guysstill new to docker :)
16 [2018-06-26T12:23:18] <babaorum> no problem. Start with docker composer (it will be easier to connect everything and tweek it for your tests)
17 [2018-06-26T12:25:33] <gabegm> Will do! thank you :)

1 [2018-06-26T09:25:16] <bhalothia> scheiblr: I'm planning to upgrade too. Please share your solution.
2 [2018-06-26T09:26:33] <bhalothia> Hello everyone, has anyone added container scanning phase to their pipelines using Clair or similar tool? If it's on gitlab then even better. Please share your experience.
3 [2018-06-26T09:28:11] <bhalothia> Okay, I'm currently on gitlab-ee:10.8.4-ee.0 and I'm in no hurry to upgrade. I think I will wait.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T09:26:54] <scheiblr> bhalothia: I'm currently developing, thus it wasn't really a 'solution' for any production system. Just removed the volumes on the host and it ran again. Upgrading should work as always.
2 [2018-06-26T09:29:50] <scheiblr> Are you using a docker registry together with gitlab? I'm currently trying to get that up and running inside one docker-compose.yml ..
3 [2018-06-26T09:30:09] <bhalothia> yep
4 [2018-06-26T09:30:24] <bhalothia> Yeah, i'm using docker registry behind a proxy.
5 [2018-06-26T09:30:45] <bhalothia> It's the same compose, managing all the components.

1 [2018-06-26T10:39:04] <uzayr> Is there any plugin for docker to give ssh access ?
2 [2018-06-26T10:39:11] <uzayr> for the container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T12:15:04] <babaorum> gabegm: why not use 2 docker containers for that ? If you want to execute two different tasks ?
2 [2018-06-26T12:17:35] <bizmate> you should run three containers then
3 [2018-06-26T12:17:41] <bizmate> sql lite separately
4 [2018-06-26T12:17:51] <bizmate> never run two jobs/processes in one container
5 [2018-06-26T12:18:45] <bizmate> although sql lite is a file only system if i remember when still abstract it into a separate container
6 [2018-06-26T12:19:08] <bizmate> then you just mount it through a volume
7 [2018-06-26T12:19:17] <bizmate> and use the volume in both containers
8 [2018-06-26T12:19:28] <bizmate> yes
9 [2018-06-26T12:19:42] <bizmate> also use docker-compose
10 [2018-06-26T12:20:00] <bizmate> it is a much nicer way of displaying your microservices components
11 [2018-06-26T12:21:49] <babaorum> Only if you need it (not familiar too)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T12:15:58] <bizmate> two containers is the way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T15:07:45] <deathgaze> All of docker’s logging options are too complicated — is there a way I can get docker-compose to just dump all my logs to a predefined text file or folder full of text files?
2 [2018-06-26T15:07:55] <deathgaze> Can anyone point me in the right direction?
3 [2018-06-26T15:42:21] <deathgaze> Don’t have time to do it right, user wants log files
4 [2018-06-26T15:42:32] <deathgaze> Should be easy, but docker is making it very complicated
5 [2018-06-26T15:42:44] <deathgaze> user doesn’t want to have to type docker commands to view logs
6 [2018-06-26T15:43:02] <bizmate> manual logs just the way you want it wont scale
7 [2018-06-26T15:43:05] <bizmate> logging is not simple
8 [2018-06-26T15:43:17] <bizmate> it will work for a few minutes
9 [2018-06-26T15:43:25] <bizmate> you will have to do it again
10 [2018-06-26T15:43:41] <bizmate> just use syslog or something similar
11 [2018-06-26T15:44:00] <bizmate> the so called user doesnt need to know where the application is running on
12 [2018-06-26T15:44:47] <deathgaze> so I would have to run a syslog server on the host machine (for example) and then let the user use some tool to connect to it?
13 [2018-06-26T15:46:46] <bizmate> or better use an hosted service
14 [2018-06-26T15:46:56] <bizmate> so you dont even need to manage it
15 [2018-06-26T16:42:04] <deathgaze> not possible - code is going onto an embedded server. :/ It needs to handle everything itself
16 [2018-06-26T16:42:20] <deathgaze> logging is apparently a huge topic I wasn’t prepared for
17 [2018-06-26T16:42:56] <deathgaze> it looks like ‘doing it right’ involves spinning up three separate services to handle logs… one for dumping, one as an outlet, and one as a log server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T15:39:36] <rcjsuen> Docker Compose if not in detached mode should just log to the terminal IIRC
2 [2018-06-26T15:39:42] <rcjsuen> You can redirect stdout/err to a file then I suppose
3 [2018-06-26T15:41:23] <bizmate> deathgaze: dont be depressed and just do it right

1 [2018-06-26T18:42:20] <mcarpenterjr> Anyone build a kolide fleet stack using docker?
2 [2018-06-26T18:42:57] <mcarpenterjr> And/Or is it possible to execute a set of commands when a container first starts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-26T18:59:13] <bizmate> deathgaze: not sure where you have seen all this but the outlet is usually just a configuration in the container, ie the syslog driver. And of course a syslog server. To extract intelligence from logs is another matter but that is external and unrelated to your requirements
2 [2018-06-26T18:59:50] <bizmate> also not sure what the difference between the dumping and outlet one is .... dumping as in an element of storage is your log server
3 [2018-06-26T19:01:12] <bizmate> so just pick a way to receive logs .... for instance a syslog server or managed solution and then run the containers to point the logs to it
4 [2018-06-26T19:01:21] <bizmate> example with papertrail [<-LINK->]
5 [2018-06-26T19:01:25] <bizmate> it is not that complex

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-27T14:02:47] <scott_sword_twitter> Trying to figure out the best way to design an image. I would like to use the official Ubuntu image and Python 3 image together, is it considered bad form to use docker compose in production?
2 [2018-06-27T14:11:03] <scott_sword_twitter> I see lots of examples where people use docker compose for local dev, just was curious what best practice is.
3 [2018-06-27T14:15:09] <scott_sword_twitter> just didn't know if there is some way to use multi-stage builds to pipe everything over from the base python image to the ubuntu image or just use compose.
4 [2018-06-27T15:48:32] <scott_sword_twitter> rcjsuen: thanks for the insight. As far as I can tell it would be more work to make sure I get everything I need over from the Python3 image to the ubuntu image than just using compose. With compose I can have my base docker image be the python image that I want and then I can just declare the distro that I want in the compose file.
5 [2018-06-27T17:31:23] <scott_sword_twitter> If you want to build a new image w/ your changes and give it a new tag to push to Docker Hub I believe the answer is yes.
6 [2018-06-27T17:32:23] <roelzkie15> What if you don't need a new image?
7 [2018-06-27T17:32:47] <rcjsuen> Then you don't need to build a new image
8 [2018-06-27T17:32:57] <rcjsuen> Although if nothing truly changed Docker will know
9 [2018-06-27T17:33:02] <rcjsuen> and the build will be done in seconds
10 [2018-06-27T17:33:06] <rcjsuen> because the cached layer
11 [2018-06-27T17:33:20] <rcjsuen> but I guess your CI probably spins something fresh everytime, so ignore what i said lol... :P
12 [2018-06-27T17:34:01] <rcjsuen> I mean, if your files change you need to build a new image I feel like, based on that question just now
13 [2018-06-27T17:34:09] <rcjsuen> But we probably don't have full context on what's going on here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-27T14:06:08] <rcjsuen> What gave you impression Docker Compose is not ready for production?
2 [2018-06-27T15:10:46] <rcjsuen> "but i get an uggly "...ugly what?
3 [2018-06-27T15:11:29] <rcjsuen> scott_sword_twitter: I think multi-stage builds could probably do what you want. Though I'm surprised there isn't already a Python image that is based off of Ubuntu...?
4 [2018-06-27T15:12:26] <rcjsuen> I guess they're built off of Debian instead...?
5 [2018-06-27T15:12:43] <rcjsuen> Or you could go super slim with Alpine...but I imagine you want Ubuntu for good reasons
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-27T14:59:22] <LukeVideo> Hy, i'm new to docker. First impressions are really good. But ... I don't understand how to pass .env variables. I have a django project for wich i put variables in a .env file.folowing this article https://staxmanade.com/2016/05/how-to-get-environment-variables-passed-through-docker-compose-to-the-containers/i understood i put my .env next to docker-compose .yml and feed the environement field like so [<-CODE->] but i get an uggly [<-CODE->] If anyone has some advise it mould be more than welcome. Thanks.
2 [2018-06-27T15:20:34] <LukeVideo> rcjsuen: sorry I pasted the wrong thing. It's an error about environment that isn't a string or an array... If I remember well. I'm commuting right now. I'll resend the exact message as I get home.
3 [2018-06-28T07:35:10] <LukeVideo> Ok so i missspelled my message yesterday (serial copy pasting gone wrong)so i get this message [<-CODE->] As i said yesterday i'm trying to populate env variables with a .env file in the same directory as docker-compose.yml in wich i try to set [<-CODE->]
4 [2018-06-28T07:53:31] <LukeVideo> OK solved ! "-ENV" != "- ENV". Just a missing space.

1 [2018-06-27T17:18:58] <roelzkie15> Do we really need to run$ docker build -t app-name .every time changes has been made to our development environment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-27T17:33:16] <roelzkie15> Then how to reflect file changes to the existing image?
2 [2018-06-27T17:33:19] <roelzkie15> alright then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-27T17:36:40] <roelzkie15> Here is the scenario:build an image (supposing everything is ok)\nrunning the image as container.\nfound out there was an error. A TYPO.\nWhat to do? build the image again.
2 [2018-06-27T17:42:47] <rcjsuen> Yeah, pretty much
3 [2018-06-27T17:43:31] <rcjsuen> so say you had likeCOPY myapp /home/deploy/myap
4 [2018-06-27T17:43:35] <rcjsuen> and oh no wrong folder,
5 [2018-06-27T17:43:41] <rcjsuen> you have no choice but to fix the Dockerfile typo and rebuild
6 [2018-06-27T17:43:56] <rcjsuen> Maybe that answers your question...?
7 [2018-06-27T17:44:24] <roelzkie15> alright then i observed that building became fast after several tries.
8 [2018-06-27T17:44:38] <roelzkie15> lot of thanks man
9 [2018-06-27T17:44:53] <rcjsuen> yeah, so it depends where your typo is
10 [2018-06-27T17:45:08] <rcjsuen> if in the top, it's gotta rebuild everything (depends, at least usually)
11 [2018-06-27T17:45:20] <rcjsuen> if at the bottom, it'll skip all that (assuming Docker feels the state is the same) until that step
12 [2018-06-27T17:45:24] <rcjsuen> Good luck with your project@badcoder28!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-28T17:37:40] <galvesribeiro> we have a system that manage resources today for our game and whenever a player ask to create a multiplayer session, this system creates a process (the game server) in a VM which has enough room to host itI was thinking on migrate it to use kubernetes and containersso the actual game server process would become a container, and our system would just ask kube to create itthe problem is, when running multiple processes in the current scenario, I share A LOT of memory (essentially the binary image) with other processes, so it save a lot of memory for us and in the end of the day, it will save us moneyso, if we migrate to containers, that would mean the memory for the process is duplicated on every containerso the question is, is there a way to share this memory across multiple containers in the same worker node in kube?for example, today if I have 10 processes on the same machine, each one has 500mb at runtime but, 100mb is the binary image which is shared, that led me to 4100mb at runtime to everything. Meaning that I save 900mb because of the shared image... Is there a way to achieve that with kube? thanks!
2 [2018-06-28T20:03:27] <galvesribeiro> SISheogorath: yeah, after I posted the question I saw that issue...
3 [2018-06-28T20:03:44] <galvesribeiro> it looks like there isn't much support for that unfortunatelly :(
4 [2018-06-28T20:04:00] <galvesribeiro> it is such a big waste of memory :/
5 [2018-06-28T20:04:07] <SISheogorath> Well, it says it's supported when you use the right storage types
6 [2018-06-28T20:04:13] <galvesribeiro> no no
7 [2018-06-28T20:04:17] <galvesribeiro> that is for FILE sharing
8 [2018-06-28T20:04:23] <galvesribeiro> I'm talking about Memory sharing
9 [2018-06-28T20:04:36] <galvesribeiro> I mean, the issue asked for memory as well
10 [2018-06-28T20:04:51] <galvesribeiro> but people who saidit worksare talking about file sharing
11 [2018-06-28T20:06:31] <SISheogorath> Well, they were talking about page sharing which needs the filesystem. but yes, there is no complete memory de-duplication
12 [2018-06-28T20:06:54] <galvesribeiro> the closest I found was [<-LINK->]
13 [2018-06-28T20:13:11] <SISheogorath> This looks good and like an easy thing, just add a cronjob on your host
14 [2018-06-28T20:13:17] <SISheogorath> to trigger a KSMd run
15 [2018-06-28T20:24:16] <galvesribeiro> I can't do that on hosted kubernetes
16 [2018-06-28T20:24:27] <galvesribeiro> like AWS EKS or Azure AKS
17 [2018-06-28T20:27:22] <galvesribeiro> we use Azure AKS for a while and we are pretty happy with it
18 [2018-06-28T20:27:46] <bizmate> mh ok
19 [2018-06-28T20:27:59] <bizmate> i dont even have a login for Azure :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-28T20:01:04] <SISheogorath> galvesribeiro: Have a look at: [<-ISSUE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-28T20:25:54] <bizmate> is AWS EKS a new toy?
2 [2018-06-28T20:26:06] <galvesribeiro> was recently made GA
3 [2018-06-28T20:26:07] <bizmate> i think last time i used ECS
4 [2018-06-28T20:26:20] <galvesribeiro> ECS == VMs, EKS == Hosted Kubernetes
5 [2018-06-28T20:26:22] <bizmate> interesting
6 [2018-06-28T20:26:56] <bizmate> i wonder how it compares to GCP, but first i need to get started with kubernetes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-28T20:28:01] <bogeylnj> AWS Fargate == serverless container orchestration(to complete the re:invent 2017 container announcements)
2 [2018-06-28T20:28:20] <bizmate> so you have 3 different ways on AWS
3 [2018-06-28T20:28:22] <bizmate> cool
4 [2018-06-28T20:28:25] <galvesribeiro>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2018-06-28T20:28:35] <galvesribeiro> yeah, but Fargate has several limitations
6 [2018-06-28T20:28:43] <galvesribeiro> anyway, it is for simple things
7 [2018-06-28T20:28:49] <bogeylnj> yeah, gain less management, lose flexibility
8 [2018-06-28T20:28:56] <galvesribeiro> just like Azure Container Instances
9 [2018-06-28T20:29:16] <galvesribeiro> it is good for scheduled jobs for example
10 [2018-06-28T20:29:34] <bizmate> You simply provision worker nodes and connect them to the provided Amazon EKS endpoint.
11 [2018-06-28T20:29:40] <bizmate> sounds similar to ECS
12 [2018-06-28T20:29:48] <bizmate> you have to provision the VMs and link them to it
13 [2018-06-28T20:31:30] <galvesribeiro> in azure u just tell how many nodes u want to start
14 [2018-06-28T20:31:39] <galvesribeiro> then u can define the autoscale rules and be happy
15 [2018-06-28T20:32:09] <bizmate> depends at what level
16 [2018-06-28T20:32:25] <bizmate> i have not deployed to production yet
17 [2018-06-28T20:32:34] <bizmate> but i dont use VMs locally in general anymore
18 [2018-06-28T20:32:43] <bizmate> still leaves me with some parity problems
19 [2018-06-28T20:32:56] <bizmate> but it is much better than waiting for virtualbox
20 [2018-06-28T20:33:32] <bizmate> also i forgot in some cases i just spin some container instances in prod for some very simple services with simple docker-compose
21 [2018-06-28T20:33:39] <bizmate> obviously not the best thing to do
22 [2018-06-28T20:33:52] <bizmate> time to use some of my AWS credits for EKS
23 [2018-06-28T20:34:25] <bizmate> bogeylnj: the company I am consulting for is all scared about containers
24 [2018-06-28T20:34:36] <bizmate> they think it will take them at least 1 year before moving
25 [2018-06-28T20:34:42] <bizmate> it can be complex
26 [2018-06-28T20:36:18] <bizmate> start converting all the dev envs and up to some sort of CI/Test environments
27 [2018-06-28T20:37:43] <bizmate> here is a sample stack [<-LINK->]
28 [2018-06-28T20:38:01] <bizmate> just build the containers, use docker-compose and convert everything
29 [2018-06-28T20:38:10] <bizmate> the above is php + rabbitmq sample
30 [2018-06-28T20:38:28] <bizmate> it is the fully automated version of what they have on their (rabbitmq) get started page for php apps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-28T20:31:41] <bogeylnj> what\'s the best "get up and go" resource you guys have come across for starting and finalizing a good movement to containerization?
2 [2018-06-28T20:33:50] <bogeylnj> getting started level, for sure.but, the levels beyond that always comes quick
3 [2018-06-28T20:35:32] <bogeylnj> we don't use any now, and are just starting with vendor images.  But, we plan to get rolling these last 2 quarters...and, I want to move as fast as possible.  But, we are at ground level now
4 [2018-06-28T20:36:50] <bogeylnj> once we know a bit more, I have some research to do on deploying an enterprise custom app stack
5 [2018-06-28T20:37:16] <bogeylnj> we'll definitely be starting local, then sandbox env, then lower environment accounts
6 [2018-06-28T20:37:48] <bogeylnj> But, I feel we have a lot of reading to do the get our heads into the arena first.
7 [2018-06-28T20:37:58] <bogeylnj>   thanks!
8 [2018-06-28T20:38:47] <bogeylnj> cool, once i understand that enough, i'll come back and ask some dumb questions :)

2 [2018-06-29T10:46:11] <go4cas> Any ideas?
3 [2018-06-29T11:05:31] <go4cas> Fixed ... was running node:alpine, which excludes curl .. so simpleRUN apk add --no-cache curladdition to the Dockerfile sorted this out!
4 [2018-06-29T11:05:54] <rcjsuen> That's Alpine for ya :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-29T15:52:45] <deepio> go4cas: @rcjsuenI was under the impression that having curl in production was a bad idea.
2 [2018-06-29T15:54:57] <deepio> jaybyrrd: i'm not a moderator or anything, but I think visibility of an issue like this should important. I'd post an issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-29T15:53:48] <jaybyrrd> Hey really quick, I had docker community edition force my system into bsod reboot loops. I'm not sure if that is an issue that needs a github issue or not since I have seen multiple similar issues posted
2 [2018-06-29T15:56:00] <jaybyrrd> Okay. I'll do. So when I get home. Hyper v is supported on an i7 6850k right?
3 [2018-06-29T15:59:51] <deepio> You're certain its (bsod) docker related? It's a similar chip to the E5-1650 so ... i think yes?
4 [2018-06-29T16:00:11] <deepio> again, not an expert
5 [2018-06-29T16:02:24] <deepio> Regardless, you can make docker toolbox work on Xeon 5500's so ...
6 [2018-06-29T16:45:09] <jaybyrrd> Yes, to fix it I had to disable hyper v, and run registry commands to fix. Let me see if I can find it.
7 [2018-06-29T16:46:21] <jaybyrrd>  [<-LINK->]
8 [2018-06-29T16:46:38] <jaybyrrd> ended up disable hyperv and running: [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-06-29T16:46:45] <jaybyrrd> from safe mode
10 [2018-06-29T19:01:46] <deepio> Well, it's a good thing there is asolution, but ideally we shouldn't have to do this...
11 [2018-06-29T21:30:32] <jaybyrrd> I agree, I am going to reformat my machine this Saturday and install docker first thing to confirm it is an issue on docker  and not my OS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-29T18:05:50] <deathgaze> bizmate: Thank you for the very complete answer. :3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-29T21:06:15] <rcjsuen> deepio: I agree. You might not always wantcurland it can be a security issue. I just meant Alpine is lightweight and used by many for a reason and sometimes it doesn't have what you might expect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-06-30T09:42:24] <go4cas> deepio: ... what would be a better alternative to curl forHEALTHCHECK?
2 [2018-06-30T09:57:19] <go4cas> Thanks,@rcjsuen! Fairly simple solution. Thanks for the link!

2 [2018-07-01T02:33:07] <avierax> I'm having an issue with the configuration interface that is accessed via the tray icon context menu
3 [2018-07-01T02:33:51] <avierax> I need to fix this to unblock one of our testers
4 [2018-07-01T02:39:43] <avierax> every time I open the settings window it closes immediately

7 [2018-07-01T02:40:40] <avierax> I have tried to locate where's the code of this window, so see if I can find a workaround to show it
8 [2018-07-01T02:41:18] <avierax> I need this because is critical for my job to make one of our chief testers happy and comfortable with docker

1 [2018-07-03T06:03:31] <Ruegen> hi everyone, just a basic question - when you are using docker-compose.yml do you need to reference a dockerfile?
2 [2018-07-03T06:04:09] <Ruegen> can\'t I just reference the image? e.g. image: "node:10"

2 [2018-07-03T13:52:51] <LukeVideo> so 192.168.1.5 is my machine (where the browser lives) and 192.168.1.6 is the server where docker lives with a django project.
3 [2018-07-03T13:55:08] <LukeVideo> this is my nginx config : [<-CODE->]
4 [2018-07-03T13:55:33] <LukeVideo> web is the django container

1 [2018-07-04T06:01:41] <empwilli> Hi folks, I've been using docker for quite some time now, mainly for managing several web applications (redmine, gitlab, ..) on a server (single instance, no load balancing or any fancy stuff). I've got an docker image for almost every application and also separate docker-compose scripts for every application (mainly to store the startup settings)
2 [2018-07-04T06:02:32] <empwilli> This works quite well but I've got the feeling that most of this is very basic, are there any advanced resources on this subject you can recomend me?
3 [2018-07-04T11:01:25] <empwilli> admin0day: : Yeah, I've got a docker-compose script per container, this helps me especially to recreate single containers fast
4 [2018-07-04T11:01:38] <empwilli> maybe i've been using docker-compose wrong all the time, that's why I ask
5 [2018-07-04T11:01:47] <empwilli> but thanks on the tip with docker swarm I will have alook into it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T07:36:08] <education-ever> .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T08:02:57] <m4d3bug> empwilli: u mean there are so many scripts for each container?
2 [2018-07-04T08:12:56] <m4d3bug> my friend and I have discussed the k8s already take down the swarm.
3 [2018-07-04T08:13:48] <m4d3bug> so we might going to depoly the k8s in the furture.
4 [2018-07-04T09:23:11] <m4d3bug> hoobean1996: 不懂你的问题
5 [2018-07-04T12:00:28] <m4d3bug> empwilli: it seems one script will be ok when u need to manager so many containers
6 [2018-07-04T12:03:38] <m4d3bug> u just need to docker-compose up -d YOURSERVICE(it means your container name)
7 [2018-07-04T12:03:56] <empwilli> ah great
8 [2018-07-04T12:04:27] <m4d3bug> so you can recreate the container which u want
9 [2018-07-04T12:05:09] <m4d3bug> without affect the other container
10 [2018-07-04T12:05:57] <m4d3bug> destroy the container just need to docker rm -f containerid
11 [2018-07-04T12:06:53] <m4d3bug> It will not affect the other containers without using the docker-compose
12 [2018-07-04T12:08:04] <empwilli> :)
13 [2018-07-04T12:13:12] <m4d3bug> empwilli: docker-compose restart YOURSERVICE it will restart as you want
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T08:07:42] <tellanad> @empwillimy suggetion is try to use docker swarm …you will exposed how to add multiple nodes under swarm also check out securing by using manajor and worker join tokens
2 [2018-07-04T08:19:42] <tellanad> Cool, Good, i am guiding to make his hands durty for next level, Swarm is there in and after docker v1.2 so no need of further installations and resources

1 [2018-07-04T08:21:43] <hoobean1996> hello everyone ,i am wondering if i want to run go binary program in docker(it means i have exec go build ..), which base image should i use ??? Thanks f
2 [2018-07-04T10:18:55] <hoobean1996> THANKS@rcjsuen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T10:16:33] <rcjsuen> Maybe one of the officialgolangimages? [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T11:08:21] <rcjsuen> empwilli: Yes, I suggest looking at Swarm or Kubernetes for the "next level"
2 [2018-07-05T12:26:20] <rcjsuen> deniz946: That really depends what they mean by "each time"
3 [2018-07-05T12:26:41] <rcjsuen> perhaps afterCOPY . .annpm installis needed but it's not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T12:01:12] <empwilli> can I then restart (as in destroy the container and recreate it) single containers individually ?
2 [2018-07-04T12:01:34] <m4d3bug> yes
3 [2018-07-04T12:01:45] <empwilli> uh nice, didn't know that was an option!

1 [2018-07-04T13:54:06] <zearaujo07> Hello all, good morning. I am a developer from brazil and i am facing a problem which i dont know how to solve. How do you guys deal with docker and shared volumes? i saw a solution with sshfs, but all examples i saw were flawed. Any  suggestion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T16:17:09] <m4d3bug> zearaujo07: u mean each container I/O the same volumes on the same time?or just shared?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-04T20:09:43] <empwilli> so kind of related to my previous question: What's a best practice for databases with docker? Currently I have a database (in a container) shared among some containers. When I add new software, I manually add an account to the database
2 [2018-07-04T20:10:08] <empwilli> now I've seen some docker-compose files which ship own databases dedicated to the application
3 [2018-07-04T20:10:20] <empwilli> is there a best practice? One database per app?

2 [2018-07-06T09:33:42] <CharcoGreen> matrixbot: oK! thanks i go to research about the monitoring tools than can help me.  thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-06T09:25:36] <matrixbot> waveywavesCharcoGreen : depends in your container and there are a lot of monitoring tool check out EFK stack
2 [2018-07-06T09:27:07] <matrixbot> waveywavesYury Zhuravlev (Gitter): /proc/net/Dev stats are not something you should follow, they are deprecated. We still ahve it around coz ifconfig ends up using it. Net stats are usually checked through ethtool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-06T12:56:56] <WolfspiritM> I'm trying to make multiple independend stacks with the same config both having their own network. In there I've a web container and an api container. The web- container accesses the api container by calling [<-LINK->] . That works as expected. Now I want the webcontainer be available to another container which is a reverse proxy so I created a proxy network and added the web container of the stacks to it. That works aswell. But once I start more then one stack and call [<-LINK->] from the web container it now access the api of another stack randomly through the proxy network.
2 [2018-07-06T12:57:22] <WolfspiritM> Any idea how to fix this without having to call stackname_api directly?

1 [2018-07-09T08:06:30] <LukeVideo> HY all i need to pass [<-CODE->] to my nginx.conf in a docker nginx image. I didn't find an easy way to do this. I have my site setting in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/site.conf but editing /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is a bit trickier.
2 [2018-07-09T08:40:56] <LukeVideo> So i'm trying to [<-CODE->] but i get a [<-CODE->]
3 [2018-07-09T08:44:18] <LukeVideo> Ok the cp command refers to the wrong filesystem... The host not the container. I'll change that first
4 [2018-07-09T08:51:12] <LukeVideo> So i tried [<-CODE->] but that just gives a [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-09T12:19:21] <LukeVideo> So, i put fastcgi settings in the site.conf as it goes in the location or http context, and added a timeout to the gunicorn command docker-compose invokes. All seems good.

1 [2018-07-09T12:22:31] <pkropp> Hi everyone.

2 [2018-07-09T12:23:56] <pkropp> I know I could just change to the folder containing the composer.json, but I wanna use a makefile to get everything done. Thats while I need subfolder mapping into the . composer docker container.

1 [2018-07-10T13:02:34] <Hamelina> Hi there :) I have some trouble connecting redis in python using a docker container. When I do it in a simple programm it works but when I connect to redis an another programm via in a docker image, it doesn't work anymore. I run : docker-compose up , and it doesn't work. Actually the programm establish a mqtt connection and listen for message and then it should connect to redis, to store data. I really don't know what's going on there. Did someone have an issue like this one ? Thanks in advance
2 [2018-07-10T13:05:49] <rcjsuen> What do you mean "it works in a simple program"
3 [2018-07-10T13:06:10] <rcjsuen> So when youdocker psyou see your Redis container running?
4 [2018-07-10T13:06:23] <rcjsuen> And when you runpython app.pyfrom the command line of your Docker host it works?
5 [2018-07-10T13:07:21] <Hamelina> I mean that if I just run a python programm that connects to redis and insert data like this : python programm.py , it works
6 [2018-07-10T13:08:23] <Hamelina> apparently Redis container is running, and when I run python app.py it doesn't works
7 [2018-07-10T13:13:12] <rcjsuen> "apparently"?
8 [2018-07-10T13:25:29] <Hamelina> I mean it is running
9 [2018-07-10T13:36:58] <rcjsuen> So your Python app works when you connect to Redis locally
10 [2018-07-10T13:37:06] <rcjsuen> but not when Redis is running on a containr?
11 [2018-07-10T13:37:19] <rcjsuen> I mean, Redis locally as in, you start Redis from the CLI and not from a Docker image
12 [2018-07-10T14:21:17] <Hamelina> I can connect redis from a docker image in a programm running like this : python myapp.py. But when I use the same piece of code to connect in my other programm running : docker-compose up, it doesn't work. The mqtt client stops listening to new messages ;?
13 [2018-07-10T14:21:27] <Hamelina> :/
14 [2018-07-10T14:41:32] <Hamelina> I think it's the combination of the both because if I just print the message received from the MQTT it prints it, and if I add a timeout as a parameter when creating the connection to redis, here is what it says : redis.exceptions.TimeoutError: Timeout connecting to server
15 [2018-07-10T14:42:57] <Hamelina> and the MQTT stops receiving receiving messages event if messages are sent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-10T14:23:06] <rcjsuen> Is the MQTT the problem or the Redis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-12T19:48:33] <nafg> dondre: it has an ip address, e.g. use docker inspect to find it. Not sure how recommended that is though ;)
2 [2018-07-12T19:48:39] <nafg> What's the exact use case?
3 [2018-07-12T19:51:15] <nafg> wait, nginx is not running inside k8s?
4 [2018-07-12T19:51:32] <nafg> wdym "included," in what practical sense?
5 [2018-07-12T19:51:50] <dondre> you can run nginx in k8s
6 [2018-07-12T19:51:57] <dondre> and i will eventually

1 [2018-07-15T00:34:05] <cs-cordero> hello, docker noob here.  i have a quick question -- is it true that i should avoid running databases inside of a docker container?
2 [2018-07-15T00:34:34] <cs-cordero> if so, i keep seeing tutorials online that uses docker-compose to start up two containers, an app container and a postgres container and connects the two
3 [2018-07-15T00:35:06] <cs-cordero> but how does that work if you're supposed to avoid containerizing the db?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-15T03:58:03] <nlevchuk> Hi Christopher. You can run db in container, but you should not keep  db's data folder inside it. Keep them in host OS. You can bind data folder to db container using Volumes in docker. Please read about Volumes in docs.

1 [2018-07-16T03:22:39] <larsdesigns> Can you describe the container?
2 [2018-07-16T03:22:44] <larsdesigns> sujaypillai: inside the container? Would depend on the container.
3 [2018-07-16T03:32:35] <larsdesigns> sujaypillai: oh okay, it looked like you were searching for the Linux logs within a container.
4 [2018-07-16T03:33:11] <larsdesigns> Like ‘/var/log/somelog'
5 [2018-07-16T03:33:19] <larsdesigns> carry on then ;-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-16T21:03:59] <chopnut> Hi guys, just learning docker. When I stopped a container and wants to restart and execute a command in it how do I do that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-16T21:46:34] <wrightMatthew> To start the container back up,docker start <container ID>then to execute a command in it,docker exec <container name> <command>
2 [2018-07-16T21:47:05] <wrightMatthew> If you want an interactive shell going, go withdocker exec -it <container name> bash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-17T08:38:59] <mohamedaittaleb> Hey !I'm having an issue, no internet inside the container :(

1 [2018-07-17T16:35:41] <shashank292> Hey !! Any one tried installing msbuild 2017 on windows docker? I have trouble adding the individual components(Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.NuGet.BuildTools) into container.. When i tried with start-process on vs_buildtools.exe , process is getting stuck.. Am not finding a way to debug/fix.. Please help..
2 [2018-07-17T16:36:07] <shashank292> mohamedaittaleb: Are you using docker for windows?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-18T12:46:00] <ldacey> A lot of my docker-compose files would start up a Postgres database to store some data (airflow, jupyterhub, etc). Is it fine to have so many separate Postgres containers running? They are all somewhat small and unrelated
2 [2018-07-18T12:46:40] <ldacey> Or would it be better to create a database and schema on actual Postgres container server and point the containers to that?
3 [2018-07-18T16:52:28] <ldacey> Yeah, most of these would be simple configuration databases which I am not regularly interacting with.
4 [2018-07-19T12:36:03] <rcjsuen> Sure looks like it
5 [2018-07-19T12:36:29] <rcjsuen> They probably want you to use Docker EE for that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-18T15:26:11] <mateothegreat> ldacey: I’d boil it down to how much a pia it will be if you have to move/migrate/rollout with all of your instances
2 [2018-07-18T15:26:44] <mateothegreat> if you don’t have any HA needs I don’t see a problem .. it’s when managing your instances, the actual db engine itself, becomes more time consuming than running a single soup’ed up instance

3 [2018-07-19T03:31:13] <gerome0123> how can i run by just typing docker ps without sudo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-19T07:57:55] <Webmyself> gerome0123: what platform are you running docker on ?
2 [2018-07-19T08:13:40] <Webmyself> gerome0123: my guess would be check if you have a docker group already created and if you do just add your user to it, if you don't create a docker group and add your user to it.

1 [2018-07-20T10:04:32] <thanhdongnguyen> Hey, Guys. What is tool or command run Docker in Production?
2 [2018-07-20T10:04:49] <rcjsuen> You can run Docker CE in production
3 [2018-07-20T10:05:33] <rcjsuen> Although frankly your question is rather vague, perhaps you should provide some mor econtext
4 [2018-07-20T10:07:42] <thanhdongnguyen> rcjsuen: Yes, Current, I running docker in local, I don’t understand at big company, what is tool they use run docker at Prod?
5 [2018-07-20T10:08:06] <rcjsuen> you can run Docker in prod
6 [2018-07-20T10:08:38] <rcjsuen> you may want to "level up" and use Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and so on if desired
7 [2018-07-20T10:08:44] <rcjsuen> but there is nothing stopping you from running Docker in prod
8 [2018-07-20T10:26:40] <thanhdongnguyen>  [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-07-20T10:27:11] <rcjsuen> No, I just mean those are some different types of software to make your life easier/better.
10 [2018-07-20T10:27:23] <thanhdongnguyen> Oh. :))
11 [2018-07-20T10:27:26] <rcjsuen> But again, you can run Docker as-is in production if you want and if it satisfies your use case.
12 [2018-07-20T10:28:10] <thanhdongnguyen> Yess. I am understanded. But i would it stable
13 [2018-07-20T10:28:24] <rcjsuen> as stable as open source software goes
14 [2018-07-20T10:28:50] <rcjsuen> not to imply that proprietary software is more or less stable than open source software :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-20T10:30:44] <thanhdongnguyen> Hahaa. Yesss. But I'm still wondering, Prior toDocker Swarm,Docker Compose,Kubernetes. At big company, What is tool they use with docker at Prod?
2 [2018-07-20T10:33:17] <rcjsuen> They probably just ran it as-is
3 [2018-07-20T10:34:25] <rcjsuen> Docker came out in 2013 and both Compose and K8s came out in 2014, Docker was still very young
4 [2018-07-20T10:35:11] <rcjsuen> I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to build their own container orchestration system. I mean, consider that Kubernetes was started by Google...
5 [2018-07-20T10:43:38] <thanhdongnguyen> yess. Prior to, Google use container, but not publickubernetes
6 [2018-07-20T10:43:49] <thanhdongnguyen> 2013, Google public kubernetes
7 [2018-07-20T10:44:14] <thanhdongnguyen> I think, Prior they useLXC

1 [2018-07-20T12:42:30] <user2301> Hi, Anyone tried to build QT applications using docker?
2 [2018-07-20T12:47:10] <user2301> I have a desktop GUI application developed using (C++/ QT IFW). The repository for this application is in gitlab. Gitlab CI/CD is configured using gitlab-ci.yml file. The gitlab runner installed on windows server 2012, will build the desktop application. The output of the build (.exe application) is compressed to zip format and delivered to artifactory server. The end user downloads the artifact (.ZIP file) and installs the application on their Windows 7/10 system. Suppose, I want to build on new windows server 2016, I have to install all the build tools along with the gitlab runner. How can I use docker in this scenario? I want to use docker to create or reproduce build enviornment.
3 [2018-07-20T14:37:06] <rcjsuen> Sounds like you need a base Windows image to start and then install the necessary C/C++ libraries/dependencies and then kick off your build
4 [2018-07-23T01:30:03] <rcjsuen> If you perform a volume mount then your container and host can access the same stuff
5 [2018-07-23T07:28:45] <user2301> Hi, I have installed gitlab runner on 4 Virtual Machines to build each application on each Virtual Machine. Is it possible to have 4 instances of gitlab runner to build 4 applications on single VM using docker?
6 [2018-07-24T10:53:23] <user2301> Hi, I am getting this error message when I try to install Chocolatey using docker... [<-CODE->]

2 [2018-07-22T11:36:53] <andern>  [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-07-22T11:37:00] <andern> That's mydocker-compose.yml
4 [2018-07-22T12:03:34] <andern> without the ls command it's literally onlyapi_1  | /bin/sh: /proj/srv: not foundDo you want the full ls output?
5 [2018-07-22T12:05:37] <andern>  [<-LINK->]
6 [2018-07-22T12:06:49] <andern> that's with the docker-compose file exactly like i pasted it earlier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-22T12:00:29] <rcjsuen> What does the full output look like?
2 [2018-07-22T12:08:27] <rcjsuen> Did you try writing a Dockerfile that does what you described?
3 [2018-07-22T12:09:00] <andern> Yes. The Dockerfile it uses actually puts srv in /proj and runs just fine
4 [2018-07-22T12:09:37] <andern> so if i use the exact same docker-compose file and just remove the "volumes" under api, it works
5 [2018-07-22T12:11:40] <rcjsuen> Did you try removing yourVOLUMEinstruction in yourDockerfile?
6 [2018-07-22T12:13:12] <andern> oh then I misunderstood your earlier question. My Dockerfile doesn't have aVOLUMEinstruction. It simply copies the srv file to /proj.WORKDIR /projCOPY --from=build /go/bin/srv .

3 [2018-07-24T15:30:41] <venesh0709> can we install on the native windows
4 [2018-07-24T15:30:54] <venesh0709> as I do on the linux machine
5 [2018-07-24T15:30:55] <venesh0709> ?
6 [2018-07-24T15:31:13] <rcjsuen> Yes
7 [2018-07-24T15:31:21] <rcjsuen> Are you asking if you need a Linux VM to run Docker on Windows?
8 [2018-07-24T15:31:52] <venesh0709> Yeah
9 [2018-07-24T15:32:13] <rcjsuen> No, you don't
10 [2018-07-24T16:05:18] <rcjsuen> Yes you can run Docker directly from Windows
11 [2018-07-24T16:49:33] <venesh0709> thank you :)

1 [2018-07-25T08:55:58] <harshana-rav> Hello we are in the baby stage of our container journey and i'm here to ask if anyone of you have any advice on the following. We got 16 odd microsvcs and we have deployed them usingdocker-composeacross 3 docker hosts. So in our CI pipeline we deploy todevtestandpreprodenvironments then once release they go to production. So my question is there a tool out there we can use to deploy containers to above environment. at the moment we have a python script to pull specific containers to the said envs but wondering if there is a better way to do this
2 [2018-07-25T11:16:39] <rcjsuen> yueyouth: Did you try usingdocker kill?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-07-25T13:38:22] <guslep> harshana-rav: you could try using ansible,  you could run the script against one or all your environment, and it would pull the docker, you could also have the script restart automatically the container. [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-07-27T10:33:12] <MaxNevermind> Can anyone tell me, whether not showing all containers is a feature or a bug for commanddocker ps -all?I run it once, it show only one container, I remove it, run the command again, and there is another stopped container, I remove it and it goes on and on and on
2 [2018-07-27T10:33:47] <rcjsuen> "I remove it". You remove "what"
3 [2018-07-27T10:34:05] <MaxNevermind> Removed a stopped container
4 [2018-07-27T10:34:05] <rcjsuen> or rather, perhaps sharing your exact terminal inputs and outputs would be more clear
5 [2018-07-27T10:36:42] <MaxNevermind>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2018-07-27T10:38:35] <MaxNevermind> I expect thatdocker ps -allwould show all containers not just one.
7 [2018-07-27T10:39:01] <rcjsuen> But you removed it
8 [2018-07-27T10:39:17] <rcjsuen> er wait hang on
9 [2018-07-27T10:39:34] <rcjsuen> nm, I'm an idiot
10 [2018-07-27T10:39:43] <MaxNevermind> I mean stopped, I know there are 3 of them
11 [2018-07-27T10:40:01] <rcjsuen> It should show them all. It does look strange
12 [2018-07-27T10:40:05] <MaxNevermind> Why does it show it one by one?
13 [2018-07-27T10:40:50] <rcjsuen> ah
14 [2018-07-27T10:40:59] <MaxNevermind> I've first encountered that behavior years ago, didn't have time to figure it all out
15 [2018-07-27T10:40:59] <rcjsuen> MaxNevermind: I see now. You need to use--allor-a
16 [2018-07-27T10:41:10] <rcjsuen> you are using-allwhich is not actually a flag
17 [2018-07-27T10:41:46] <rcjsuen> I suppose it should show warning/err instead but anyway
18 [2018-07-27T10:42:30] <MaxNevermind> oh yeahyour are right, thanks!though this behavior is kinda strange
19 [2018-07-27T10:42:57] <rcjsuen> no problem

8 [2018-07-29T18:00:21] <rcjsuen> Otherwise yourbashjust terminates immediately
9 [2018-07-29T18:01:35] <jsign> ButCMD ["bash"]doesn\'t runbash, anddocker runshould start the container and keep it alive until thebashprocess terminates? (which is whenexitis fired)
10 [2018-07-29T18:01:41] <jsign> Or am I getting something wrong here?
11 [2018-07-29T18:02:11] <jsign> To be shorter: the container should stop when the CMD exits.
12 [2018-07-29T18:02:32] <rcjsuen> And thebashterminated immediately
13 [2018-07-29T18:02:50] <jsign> butbashdoesn`t terminate when theexitcomand is used?
14 [2018-07-29T18:03:05] <rcjsuen> Sorry, I don't understand your question.
15 [2018-07-29T18:03:58] <rcjsuen> if youdocker run alpineit will also die immediately, butdocker run -it alpinewill let you use Alpine
16 [2018-07-29T18:04:29] <jsign> What happens if you runbashin your terminal?. Does it finish immediately?
17 [2018-07-29T18:04:56] <rcjsuen> No, but that's because I have a terminal
18 [2018-07-29T18:05:23] <rcjsuen> In Docker's case it doesn't have one, sobashdies
19 [2018-07-29T18:05:48] <jsign> Ok, so I guess there is my confusion. Why does that makes a difference?.bashdoesnt keep reading stdin until theexitcommand is executed?
20 [2018-07-29T18:09:28] <rcjsuen> That I'm not sure about it. But there is nothing in itsstdinanyway
21 [2018-07-29T18:10:41] <rcjsuen> For interactive processes (like a shell), you must use -i -t together in order to allocate a tty for the container process.
22 [2018-07-29T18:13:47] <jsign> Yeah, I use-ita lot, but in this case a want to make a docker image that runs abash. Then if I want to interact, I coulddocker attachafterwards.I know I could do it withdocker run -d -ti, but is that theonlyway?
23 [2018-07-29T18:20:43] <rcjsuen> I'm not sure ifdocker attachis what you want. After you attach and you're done how do you detach?
24 [2018-07-29T18:20:52] <rcjsuen> When you detach your container's bash dies, doesn't it?
25 [2018-07-29T18:21:39] <jsign> You can detach withctrl-p ctrl-q

27 [2018-07-29T18:22:03] <rcjsuen> Ah
28 [2018-07-29T18:22:05] <rcjsuen> Alright, you got me
29 [2018-07-29T20:20:30] <jsign> seems to work for me.

1 [2018-07-30T20:33:08] <rightisleft> Hi folks - im trying to pause a containers default boot sequence - below is the Dockerfile in question - it is my understand that i should be able to override the command entry docker-compose file likecommand: sleep 6000to allow my to exec into the container. Is there some reason why the service keeps starting anyway? [<-LINK->]
2 [2018-07-30T20:34:32] <rightisleft> the default container hasCMD ["-b", "0.0.0.0"]- i should either be able to use docker-compose run keycloak bash OR in docker-compose.yml - for the keycloak entry- provide command: sleep 6000
3 [2018-07-30T20:34:38] <rightisleft> am i missing something?
4 [2018-07-30T21:34:56] <rcjsuen> rightisleft: So you mean you don't want it to start JBoss?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2018-08-02T05:32:07] <mairelin> Hi, I'm trying to run a docker container but it's dying inmediatly and is not any log about the reason. Someone knows this situation?
2 [2018-08-02T13:26:39] <mairelin> manueldeveloper: I\'m executing a command, I\'m running a binary generared with go CMD [". /go binary"]
3 [2018-08-02T13:30:42] <mairelin> rcjsuen: I'm running this commanddocker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name nmrk --link nmrk-db-container  --net api_nmrk-network  nmrkapi
4 [2018-08-02T15:47:24] <mairelin> rcjsuen: I couldn't pass -a to the docker run command but I put in foreground  and nothing still happen :(, I'm almost crying
5 [2018-08-02T15:49:29] <rcjsuen> That's strange. What happens when you use-a
6 [2018-08-02T15:50:05] <rcjsuen> Or just drop the-dand see what happens and don't even use-a
7 [2018-08-02T15:51:17] <mairelin> rcjsuen: ok
8 [2018-08-02T16:00:56] <mairelin> rcjsuen: I was using the -a flag in the wrong way,  I just fixed it, but I also still with the same issue
9 [2018-08-02T16:01:43] <mairelin> manueldeveloper: I changed to the ENTRYPOINT,  and still having the same issue
10 [2018-08-02T16:02:39] <manueldeveloper> mairelin: which FROM are you using?
11 [2018-08-02T16:03:05] <mairelin> This is what happen after  CMD or ENTRYPOINT,
12 [2018-08-02T16:04:25] <mairelin>  [<-LINK->]
13 [2018-08-02T16:04:50] <mairelin> manueldeveloper: I\'m using  "golang:1.8-alpine"
14 [2018-08-02T16:05:20] <manueldeveloper> perfect
15 [2018-08-02T16:06:17] <manueldeveloper> Maybe your problem is related to the location of the executable/binary
16 [2018-08-02T16:06:28] <rcjsuen> Yes, what is yourWORKDIR
17 [2018-08-02T16:06:36] <manueldeveloper> exactly
18 [2018-08-02T16:07:01] <rcjsuen> though really, when youdocker runit should give you some errors as by default it should attach tostdoutand so on
19 [2018-08-02T16:07:37] <rcjsuen> You can also of course give the absolute path to yourENTRYPOINT
20 [2018-08-02T16:07:47] <rcjsuen> That would be a good quick way to see if your build binary output is good
21 [2018-08-02T16:07:54] <rcjsuen> Then you can think about restructuringWORKDIRand so on perhaps
22 [2018-08-02T16:08:10] <manueldeveloper> I agree with@rcjsuen
23 [2018-08-02T16:08:49] <mairelin> I will give you my docker ifle
24 [2018-08-02T16:08:51] <mairelin> file
25 [2018-08-02T16:10:14] <manueldeveloper> whatever you want
26 [2018-08-02T16:10:33] <mairelin>  [<-CODE->]
27 [2018-08-02T16:11:39] <rcjsuen> holy mackerel
28 [2018-08-02T16:12:48] <rcjsuen> I see some strangeness...but I don't know how Go builds things so...
29 [2018-08-02T16:14:38] <manueldeveloper> first, it could be better expose the port before the entrypoint
30 [2018-08-02T16:15:43] <manueldeveloper> second, you need to include the "go" command into ENTRYPOINT
31 [2018-08-02T16:16:18] <manueldeveloper> as followsENTRYPOINT ["go", "./pecuniaapi"]
32 [2018-08-02T16:17:03] <manueldeveloper> entrypoint command paste each element of the array  in a shell command
33 [2018-08-02T16:18:13] <manueldeveloper> but as@rcjsuensaid... there several weird things related to the build of the final executable
34 [2018-08-02T16:19:51] <manueldeveloper> and I'm not an expert of Go (I'd want to but not yet)
35 [2018-08-02T16:19:53] <manueldeveloper> :p
36 [2018-08-02T17:02:06] <rcjsuen> OK. And what happened with the investigative steps we suggested
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-02T06:55:24] <manueldeveloper> mairelin: Maybe there is no command/execution which let's the container still executing
2 [2018-08-02T15:55:56] <manueldeveloper> mairelin: I think that the error could be the way that your are using CMD command
3 [2018-08-02T15:56:34] <manueldeveloper> personally, I prefer to use ENTRYPOINT
4 [2018-08-02T15:57:34] <manueldeveloper> could you change it like this:ENTRYPOINT ["go", "./binary"]?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-02T09:58:34] <rcjsuen> How are you starting/running the container?
2 [2018-08-02T15:30:11] <rcjsuen> mairelin: If you use-dthen you're detached. Maybe try with-ainstead.

1 [2018-08-02T16:56:11] <mairelin> I also tried running the same binary that works fine without docker
2 [2018-08-02T17:54:04] <mairelin> rcjsuen: nothing, I'm creating now an empty new project.
3 [2018-08-02T17:56:46] <mairelin> because the most weird that the docker file started to fail after I have renamed the project, and the name of some folders. and if i compare the last one and the older have the same struct, only change the dep part and the folders name
4 [2018-08-02T20:52:17] <mairelin> Helloooooo@rcjsuen@manueldeveloperI found the problem, was that I was calling localhost and not to the ip or container name to connect to database container inside the  app. I also was redirecting wrong the stdout. Now I will to take off some bad practice on my docker file. Thanks too much for you help. :). I'm so happy :D
5 [2018-08-02T20:52:39] <rcjsuen> OK
6 [2018-08-02T20:52:46] <rcjsuen> Well, I dunno what you were doing that redirected stdout badly
7 [2018-08-02T20:52:55] <rcjsuen> Oh, unless your app itself wasn't writing to stdout/stderr...then yeah..............
8 [2018-08-02T20:53:17] <rcjsuen> mairelin: Anyway, good to hear you're fine and thank you for sharing your mistake/solution (helps everyone in the channel learn!).
9 [2018-08-02T20:53:21] <rcjsuen> mairelin: Good luck with your project!

2 [2018-08-06T11:29:00] <samspired> the command -docker run -v /usb-drive/projects/app:/usr/local/app --rm -it image_name bashdoesnt work, the container directory -/usr/local/appis empty.
3 [2018-08-06T11:29:55] <samspired> when the same projects/app is saved in my mac hard drive and mounted using-vfrom there, then it does work.
4 [2018-08-06T11:31:01] <samspired> docker containers cannot read host volumes with-vfrom external hard drives?
5 [2018-08-06T11:34:56] <babaorum> I think this may help you

7 [2018-08-06T11:35:34] <babaorum> the first answer seems to talk about a config path to add for docker to know the mounted paths
8 [2018-08-06T11:41:25] <samspired> thank you sir
9 [2018-08-06T11:47:31] <samspired> oh the solution seems only for -Docker-for-macdoesn't answer if i am using docker-machine?
10 [2018-08-06T11:50:07] <samspired> this might work - [<-LINK->]
11 [2018-08-06T12:38:48] <babaorum> Do tell me if this fix your issue, I'm interested. Sorry for the bad link, I think the issue might be similar (your link is better in your case)
12 [2018-08-06T13:35:23] <samspired> ok i am not trying right now since it involves doing some extra steps to mount usb to docker-machine each time its restarted
13 [2018-08-06T13:35:38] <samspired> but i suppose it should work

1 [2018-08-10T14:35:45] <slim-hmidi> Hi I'm trying to add an extension to my postgres docker container which is contained under a kubernetes pod.Dockerfile: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-13T10:55:48] <user2301> not able to access the github.com from docker container when i try to access golang packages
2 [2018-08-13T10:56:20] <user2301> Should I set username and password within dockerfile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-13T11:47:27] <basz> does any of you use something like \'docker run --rm --volume $(pwd):/app --volume $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-auth.sock --env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-auth.sock --volume "$HOME"/.ssh/known_hosts:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts:ro composer install\' to install dependencies inside a gitlab-ci WITH private repositories? I can\'t get it to work... (googlingdocker composeryields results all over the place). Note that a simple git clone private-repo-url works without issue, so my keys and hosts stuff should work. I keep getting "Host key verification failed."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-14T05:39:38] <dalau6> Hey guys, for Docker Compose command option, how would I cd into a folder inside my container before running a port?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-15T09:47:48] <DinoSourcesRex> Can I pass variables to a dockerfile at runtime?What I want: I have a dockerfile for mongorestoring, but we have multiple environments. I don't want to have to create an image per environment. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-08-15T09:47:55] <DinoSourcesRex> Anyone got any ideas?
3 [2018-08-15T10:10:11] <DinoSourcesRex> rcjsuen: I have, however args are on build which means it would create a new image each time
4 [2018-08-15T10:10:16] <DinoSourcesRex> Or have I misunderstood?
5 [2018-08-15T10:10:48] <DinoSourcesRex> For example if I have 3 environments, dev, stage and prod - each with different credentials I would have 3 images instead of 1.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-15T10:08:22] <rcjsuen> DinoSourcesRex: Read up onARGand the idea of "build args"
2 [2018-08-15T10:10:45] <rcjsuen> I think I misunderstood your question.
3 [2018-08-15T10:11:02] <rcjsuen> you say they are not "picking up the variables I am passing"
4 [2018-08-15T10:11:04] <rcjsuen> What do you mean
5 [2018-08-15T10:11:15] <rcjsuen> in your shell you setmongo_host=blah
6 [2018-08-15T10:11:19] <DinoSourcesRex> Yeah, that's right. Can I use environment variables in aDockerfile?
7 [2018-08-15T10:11:22] <rcjsuen> but in Docker when you build it still says--host host?
8 [2018-08-15T10:11:52] <DinoSourcesRex>  [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-08-15T10:12:07] <DinoSourcesRex> That's the compose file I am using. Different credentials of course
10 [2018-08-15T10:12:24] <rcjsuen> Sounds to me like you should use a config file instead
11 [2018-08-15T10:12:44] <DinoSourcesRex> Would that let me pass in variables into a dockerfile?
12 [2018-08-15T10:12:53] <rcjsuen> well
13 [2018-08-15T10:12:57] <rcjsuen> MongoDB would read the config
14 [2018-08-15T10:13:00] <rcjsuen> and then figure out how to connect
15 [2018-08-15T10:14:33] <DinoSourcesRex> Wouldn't I still end up with 3 images there though?
16 [2018-08-15T10:15:15] <DinoSourcesRex> An image with a mongo config file per environment, in which case it doesn't really beat using arguments
17 [2018-08-15T10:15:24] <rcjsuen> No
18 [2018-08-15T10:15:30] <rcjsuen> Because you would volume mount the config file
19 [2018-08-15T10:16:25] <DinoSourcesRex> That makes sense.
20 [2018-08-15T10:16:58] <DinoSourcesRex> So, to be clear, there is no way to pass in environment variables to be used within my dockerfile?
21 [2018-08-15T10:17:02] <DinoSourcesRex> Only within the container?
22 [2018-08-15T10:17:57] <rcjsuen> Not that I know of. That wouldn't make sense in the context of how Docker images work.
23 [2018-08-15T10:18:35] <rcjsuen> Otherwise you use anENTRYPOINT
24 [2018-08-15T10:18:39] <rcjsuen> and then pass all that stuff in yourself by hand
25 [2018-08-15T10:19:14] <rcjsuen> ENTRYPOINT [ "mongorestore" ]and then whatever comes after you pass through on the CLI
26 [2018-08-15T10:19:22] <rcjsuen> I suppose that would be an alternative (in your particular scenario)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-15T10:20:41] <DinoSourcesRex> I'll have to read up on how entrypoint's work. I'm still a docker novice so I'm not entirely sure on the ins and outs of these things.
2 [2018-08-15T10:20:44] <DinoSourcesRex> Appreciate the help!
3 [2018-08-15T10:21:18] <rcjsuen> Good luck@DinoSourcesRex
4 [2018-08-15T10:21:40] <DinoSourcesRex> Thanks@rcjsuen
5 [2018-08-15T11:41:34] <DinoSourcesRex> rcjsuen: Oh man...you're never going to guess how stupid I am.
6 [2018-08-15T11:42:20] <DinoSourcesRex> So. the issue with the environment variables was that I had a space in my docker-compose file when I was setting them. So something like$mongo_hostwould not work because the variable actually included a space
7 [2018-08-15T11:46:13] <rcjsuen> interesting
8 [2018-08-15T11:46:14] <rcjsuen> well then
9 [2018-08-15T11:52:05] <DinoSourcesRex> My original idea works, though, which is good.
10 [2018-08-15T12:49:01] <DinoSourcesRex> What is the ideal way to open a shell into a running container? Or to set my container up so that the entrypoint is a shell
11 [2018-08-15T12:52:56] <rcjsuen> DinoSourcesRex: The trick (?) we use at work is to usedocker exec
12 [2018-08-15T12:53:07] <rcjsuen> docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash(or/bin/ashif Alpine)
13 [2018-08-15T12:53:11] <rcjsuen> Does that work for you?
14 [2018-08-15T12:53:51] <rcjsuen> Of course if your container has no name you can use the ID
15 [2018-08-15T12:53:57] <rcjsuen> get fromdocker ps
16 [2018-08-15T12:54:11] <rcjsuen> But on that note I recommend having a name for the sake of sanity
17 [2018-08-15T13:23:36] <DinoSourcesRex> rcjsuen: My container is a short lived container, and I becauseexecrequires a running container I wouldn't be able to run that command (without a script) quickly enough. Is there an alternative, such as swappingexecforrun? If so, then that fails.
18 [2018-08-15T13:48:28] <rcjsuen> DinoSourcesRex: So instead of having your image run mongorestore, you want it to NOT do that but just open a shell?
19 [2018-08-16T12:38:03] <rcjsuen> Bind mounts are specific to a host so they don't belong in aDockerfile

1 [2018-08-17T16:29:02] <adamretter> In a multi-stage docker file, does eachFROMcreate an intermediate image? In the docs, it seems to say no, or is confusing at best, but in experimentation here it seems to create an intermediate image for each stage
2 [2018-08-17T16:31:36] <adamretter> Ah crap. it looks like I was meant to ask this on FreeNode
3 [2018-08-17T16:33:44] <adamretter> EnisG: right. Did you find any solution?
4 [2018-08-17T17:05:47] <adamretter> EnisG: I was suggested to usedocker image prune
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-17T16:32:58] <EnisG> adamretter: I also experienced that. It leaves dangling images for every stage
2 [2018-08-17T17:07:08] <EnisG> adamretter: yes that will clean dangling images. Not sure if there is OOB solution to periodically clean these images

1 [2018-08-22T06:12:21] <pete013> Hello!Need some help here.I have hosted a docker container in a windows 10 enterprise system. The issue is that the Docker for Windows was run using a windows user account. After a few hours, the windows user logs out automatically, also the docker daemon is shutdown. However the system is still on.I need the docker daemon to remain running even after the user logs out.How to do that?Thanks
2 [2018-08-22T06:17:36] <pete013> Is there some way to run the docker daemon as system process?
3 [2018-08-22T06:20:12] <pete013> Are there no configuration options in Docker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-22T06:14:58] <mantoshelis> Hi, it's impossible because on user log out everything related with user (processes and etc.) is shut down.
2 [2018-08-22T06:17:11] <mantoshelis> Docker daemon should be as a service so it does not depend on user started it.
3 [2018-08-22T06:17:49] <mantoshelis>  [<-LINK->]
4 [2018-08-22T06:21:40] <mantoshelis> I think is not Docker scope how you run it (process or system service).
5 [2018-08-22T06:23:47] <mantoshelis> As I see there should be registered Docker service in service list on Windows. You could change it to Autostart (delayed).

1 [2018-08-22T07:11:44] <albercuba__twitter> Hello everyone. Can someone please help me configure a docker compose file so i connects to a mysql database in a differnte host? I have never used Docker before and I've been looking for a solution to this for 2 days now.this is the DB part in the docker-compose file [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-08-22T07:20:15] <albercuba__twitter> MCPDanilovich: no. I have a DB server installed in my network. Not in a docker container. Then I need my docker container to connect to this external DB server
3 [2018-08-22T07:21:55] <albercuba__twitter> So, if I understand correctly, this section of the docker compose file, creates a MySQL instance with that data
4 [2018-08-22T07:22:01] <albercuba__twitter> but I dont want that.
5 [2018-08-22T07:22:14] <albercuba__twitter> I want to connect to a different DB server
6 [2018-08-22T07:23:27] <albercuba__twitter> then I think this section connects to the database [<-CODE->]
7 [2018-08-22T07:24:49] <albercuba__twitter> I don't want to connect a DB in docker to an external DB. I want my docker containers' apps to use an external DB
8 [2018-08-22T07:31:03] <albercuba__twitter> I have no idea. This guys have a very bad documentation
9 [2018-08-22T07:31:46] <albercuba__twitter> somewhere in here [<-LINK->]
10 [2018-08-22T07:34:08] <albercuba__twitter> Can I do this?: [<-CODE->]
11 [2018-08-22T07:37:49] <albercuba__twitter> OO I found it
12 [2018-08-22T07:38:15] <albercuba__twitter> the env file
13 [2018-08-22T07:38:41] <albercuba__twitter> right there in front of my eyes :p
14 [2018-08-22T07:39:33] <albercuba__twitter> and then delete the db section from the docker-compose file?
15 [2018-08-22T07:39:42] <MCPDanilovich> yes.
16 [2018-08-22T07:39:58] <MCPDanilovich> And you can delete db from links section in web service
17 [2018-08-22T07:40:08] <albercuba__twitter> ok thanks, gonna try that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-22T07:15:37] <MCPDanilovich> albercuba__twitter: As i undestood true, you want expose ports to host for this db running in docker ?
2 [2018-08-22T07:23:54] <MCPDanilovich> Why you want connect db in docker to external db ?
3 [2018-08-22T07:29:43] <MCPDanilovich> where ralf store db setting. ?
4 [2018-08-22T07:39:06] <MCPDanilovich> Good. You should changes this vars to your real db data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-22T18:37:05] <kirk86>  [<-CODE->] Thanks and again apologies!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-22T19:29:18] <rcjsuen> T hey'll still be there.
2 [2018-08-22T19:29:24] <rcjsuen> Yes, they're a goner AFAIK.
3 [2018-08-22T19:29:48] <rcjsuen>  [<-ISSUE->] Uh...maybe you should explain what you're trying to do :)
4 [2018-08-22T19:30:03] <rcjsuen> kirk86: It sounds in a way like you're trying to use Docker as a reusable VM.
5 [2018-08-22T21:57:27] <rcjsuen> kirk86: Yes. But again, I feel you should try to explain what you're trying to do...
6 [2018-08-22T21:57:42] <rcjsuen> Without more context it's hard to say if you're using the right tool for the job
7 [2018-08-22T21:59:17] <rcjsuen> kirk86: I would consider an "image" to be a blueprint and the "container" to be a built house. Perhaps that analogy will help. You can abandon the house (stop it) but if you destroy it it\'s lost forever (no you can\'t salvage the table legs or wood and brick)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-22T20:02:35] <kirk86> @rcjsuen thanks for replying. As  I said kind of new in the docker thing trying to wrap my head around it. So when you stop a container the newly installed stuff will still be there, right? Does a stopped container still consume system resources. I presume yes? [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-08-22T20:16:57] <rcjsuen> kirk86: It shouldn't consume system resources.
3 [2018-08-22T20:17:27] <rcjsuen> rmiis for images,rmis  for containers
4 [2018-08-22T20:33:19] <kirk86> rcjsuen: cool thanks! so in general if avoidrmand just stop the container I should be safe restart and resume where I left off?

3 [2018-08-23T02:12:16] <rcjsuen> Ishaan28malik: You don't need to join the organization to contribute to projects.
4 [2018-08-23T02:12:41] <rcjsuen> Make your changes, commit, push them to your fork on GitHub, and then open a pull request
5 [2018-08-23T08:07:44] <Ishaan28malik> Is there any direct link to be a member of org at github and then contribute to it
6 [2018-08-23T08:07:55] <Ishaan28malik> Or any guide pls let me know ...
7 [2018-08-23T11:52:18] <rcjsuen> Ishaan28malik: As I said, you don't need to be an org member
8 [2018-08-23T11:52:42] <rcjsuen> this might help get you started [<-LINK->]
9 [2018-08-23T11:53:01] <rcjsuen> I assume you know Go, but even if you don't you can help with other things such as documentation or simply filing bugs!
10 [2018-08-23T13:30:17] <rcjsuen> Well after you build it you can run it
11 [2018-08-23T13:30:30] <rcjsuen> So if you did likedocker build -t abc .
12 [2018-08-23T13:30:34] <rcjsuen> then you can now run yourabcimage
13 [2018-08-23T13:34:43] <rcjsuen> You would set your entrypoint...to what you want it to be #zing
14 [2018-08-23T13:34:57] <rcjsuen> for example a Linux image might be set to run/bin/bashor whatever
15 [2018-08-23T13:35:05] <rcjsuen> but your app might be configured to run your app
16 [2018-08-23T13:35:36] <rcjsuen> Not really...or I'm just not reading it properly
17 [2018-08-23T13:35:44] <rcjsuen> But perhaps it sounds like you want the same entrypoint as thetensorflow/servingimage
18 [2018-08-23T13:35:52] <rcjsuen> So you can check its Dockerfile (assuming it is open source and all that good stuff)
19 [2018-08-23T19:00:38] <rcjsuen> It sounds to me like you should just use the same entrypoint that yourtensorflow/servingbase image is using then
20 [2018-08-23T21:53:00] <rcjsuen> I guess it inherited the original image's ENTRYPOINT then

3 [2018-08-23T13:34:01] <DinoSourcesRex> @rcjsuen What would I set my entry point  to?If I have [<-CODE->] How do i start the root image using the saved files?
4 [2018-08-23T13:35:08] <DinoSourcesRex> Currently I executedocker run -p 8501:8501 -v /c/path:/models/mode -e MODEL_NAME=mode -t tensorflow/serving- I just want to have the directory within an image
5 [2018-08-23T13:35:09] <DinoSourcesRex> if that makes sense
6 [2018-08-23T13:46:19] <DinoSourcesRex> @rcjsuen I think it is open source, yes. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Does that make sense? Is it possible to somehow "save" a running container?
7 [2018-08-23T13:46:27] <DinoSourcesRex> Because that would basically give me what I need.
8 [2018-08-23T13:46:49] <DinoSourcesRex> I've trieddocker commitbut it doesn't seem to be saving the mounted files

1 [2018-08-23T13:11:24] <LanderU> DinoSourcesRex: you can build your image on top of another image using in your Dockerfile the FROM of that image. FROM <the image that you want to base on>

1 [2018-08-23T22:07:51] <jamesalbert> I've never had this problem before. For some reason, I can't make any ssl requests on any container (alpine, ubuntu, etc). It just stopped working for some reason. I have the openssl packages installed. Anyone else have this problem before? Not a single so answer has helped me yet and I'm ripping my hair out at this point :)
2 [2018-08-23T22:11:28] <jamesalbert> In my fluster, forgot to post the actual errors. I've gotten a couple, so far I've seencurl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it.andSSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed
3 [2018-08-23T22:11:52] <jamesalbert> I've seen these errors before, but usually installing openssl is enough to call it a day
4 [2018-08-23T22:14:53] <jamesalbert> MCPDanilovich: thanks for the response, but I need a secure response
5 [2018-08-23T22:15:30] <jamesalbert> I'm not sure why this is happening, I've never wasted so much time on this error
6 [2018-08-23T22:15:57] <jamesalbert> I've also tried --cacert, same error
7 [2018-08-23T22:19:18] <jamesalbert> but no ssl requests are successful. Google, Amazon. All don't seem to work. I'm sure it's on my side, I just don't know what
8 [2018-08-23T22:19:46] <jamesalbert> host works just fine
9 [2018-08-23T22:23:38] <jamesalbert> throws computer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-23T22:14:07] <MCPDanilovich> try to use curl with -k key
2 [2018-08-23T22:14:19] <MCPDanilovich> -k, --insecure(TLS) By default, every SSL connection curl makes is verified to be secure. This option allows curl to proceed and operate even for server connections otherwise considered insecure.The server connection is verified by making sure the server's certificate contains the right name and verifies successfully using the cert store.See this online resource for further details:  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.htmlSee also --proxy-insecure and --cacert.
3 [2018-08-23T22:16:54] <MCPDanilovich> This is mean that remote server cert has issues

1 [2018-08-25T01:30:16] <salman-ca> Hi, when using docker compose, i'm confused how I have 1 Dockerfile but inside of the docker-compose.yml I have multiple service definitions.
2 [2018-08-25T01:30:23] <salman-ca> do they all use the same Dockerfile?
3 [2018-08-25T01:31:03] <salman-ca> or what  if I need to customize the image for multiple services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-25T09:36:22] <mixja> If you reference the same Dockerfile in the service definition then they are using the same Dockerfile.  If you need to customise the image for different use cases your options are:Supply different command arguments and/or entrypoint to the same image\nCreate a different Dockerfile for each service\nUse a multi-stage build (see https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) which allows you to create images based upon named targets in your DockerfileIt really depends on your use case as to which option you should choose - they are all valid depending on the scenario.

1 [2018-08-25T19:02:13] <DinoSourcesRex> Has anyone got experience with digitalocean droplets and docker? I'm looking for the best way to pull an image from my local dev machine into a docker droplet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-26T11:42:02] <jdickey> Never done it from my local dev machine; just never investigated what all needs to be done to set up a Docker image registry there. I have two private images hosted on Docker Hub. They'll let you have one with a free account; more, you need to pay a few bucks a month
2 [2018-08-26T11:44:20] <jdickey> but I use Ansible to install and configure the Droplet; the image itself is as simple as runningdocker loginfrom the Droplet and thendocker pulland done
3 [2018-08-26T11:45:11] <jdickey> and of course they'll let you host as manypublicimages as you like on a free account

1 [2018-08-27T02:23:27] <mterron> Hi team, I run into a behaviour I don't understand with tmpfs. I create a dockerfile where I create a directory in /run and set some permissions. Then I docker run with a tmpfs over /run and my directory is gone. I expected the existing directory would still exist.
2 [2018-08-27T02:23:53] <mterron> Is my understanding wrong or is it just as designed? I can't see a way to use tmpfs the way it is since only root can write to it.
3 [2018-08-27T02:26:43] <mterron> The example give where you use mount does not work either, the mode is always 755 no matter what tmpfs-mode is set to
4 [2018-08-27T02:27:35] <mterron> My docker version is:
5 [2018-08-27T02:27:36] <mterron> Client: Version:           18.06.0-ce API version:       1.38 Go version:        go1.10.3 Git commit:        0ffa825 Built:             Wed Jul 18 19:09:33 2018 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64 Experimental:      falseServer: Engine:  Version:          18.06.0-ce  API version:      1.38 (minimum version 1.12)  Go version:       go1.10.3  Git commit:       0ffa825  Built:            Wed Jul 18 19:13:46 2018  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64  Experimental:     false
6 [2018-08-27T03:15:13] <mterron> Is there any way to use tmpfs mounts without being root?
7 [2018-08-27T20:03:20] <mterron> Hi
8 [2018-08-27T20:03:23] <mterron> anyone home?
9 [2018-08-27T20:09:18] <mterron> I want to run with read-only fs and use tmpfs for things like /run and /tmp
10 [2018-08-27T20:10:01] <mterron> So that the system can actually do something useful, but I found that tmpfs has 750 permissions for root only, so that means that you either run as root OR use tmpfs, but not both
11 [2018-08-27T20:10:55] <mterron> That'd be fine if Docker recreated the existing directories within /run with the correct permissions, but it just mounts an empty dir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-08-27T20:06:45] <rcjsuen> I've never usedtmpfsbefore. What are you trying to achieve and why are you choosing to usetmpfs?
2 [2018-08-27T21:10:57] <rcjsuen> That depends on your port binds
3 [2018-08-27T21:11:23] <rcjsuen> assuming you exposed ports that is also
4 [2018-08-27T21:12:39] <rcjsuen> Maybe this will help [<-LINK->]

7 [2018-08-27T21:14:03] <StevenSalazarM> i'm using docker toolbox does it change anything?
8 [2018-08-27T21:14:12] <rcjsuen> wow that sounds old

1 [2018-08-29T16:57:52] <rcjsuen> ctrado18: Perhaps you should launch your Docker container with a custom entrypoint to/bin/bashor something so you can inspects its contents

1 [2018-08-29T18:58:39] <brentarias> Using Docker for Windows, I typeddocker pull wordpress:4.9.4.  Because that "4.9.4" tag does not exist, I get "incorrect user name or password".  How do I find the proper 4.9.4 tag?  Currently the docker wordpress repository shows only tags for 4.9.8.
2 [2018-08-29T18:59:40] <rcjsuen> It's not listed [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-08-29T18:59:43] <rcjsuen> maybe they d eleted it?
4 [2018-08-29T19:18:46] <brentarias> I can't imagine they would ever delete such tags.  In fact, there is no point in having a tag system if they simply delete all the old ones as soon as they have new ones.
5 [2018-08-29T19:22:02] <rcjsuen> Devil's advocate, I would delete my tag if it has a security issue or whatever
6 [2018-08-29T21:22:26] <brentarias> I figured it out.  I was logged into my docker account with my e-mail instead of my user name.  Both point to the same account, but if I'm logged in with my e-mail I have a very limited range of repositories i can reach.  I was able todocker pull hello-worldbut nothing from wordpress would pull.  Now I'm logged in with my username, and everything is fine.

1 [2018-08-30T12:09:16] <kayvanbree> Hey guys
2 [2018-08-30T12:09:29] <kayvanbree> I'm trying to follow a tutorial at [<-LINK->]
3 [2018-08-30T12:11:57] <kayvanbree> I'm stuck. I bought a VPS a few days ago.docker-compose up -dshould run three containers: nginx, nginx-letsencrypt and nginx-gen
4 [2018-08-30T12:12:13] <kayvanbree> when I rundocker psI don't see nginx-gen
5 [2018-08-30T12:12:51] <kayvanbree> I did create another container to run a website on. The code is at [<-LINK->]
6 [2018-08-30T12:13:38] <kayvanbree> When I set the virtual port inautomated_nginx_demoto 3000, I could actually reach the Angular page running on that container.
7 [2018-08-30T12:14:32] <kayvanbree> When I rundocker psI see thatautomated_nginx_demohas exposed port 80, butnginxdidn't. Still, I can't reach my demo site
8 [2018-08-30T12:29:03] <kayvanbree> I trieddocker-compose logsbut I didn't know you could do that per service. Also didn't know about thedocker-compose pscommand
9 [2018-08-30T12:30:07] <tim-klug> you can run most of the docker-compose commands per service, like restart, stop, etc
10 [2018-08-30T12:30:33] <kayvanbree> docker-compose pssays the state of nginx-gen is Exit 1
11 [2018-08-30T12:30:53] <kayvanbree> So I guess I should rundocker-compose up nginx-genand see what it logs?
12 [2018-08-30T12:31:30] <tim-klug> you can even rundocker-compose logs nginx-gento see why it crahsed
13 [2018-08-30T12:31:52] <kayvanbree> it saysunable to parse template: read /etc/docker-gen/templates/nginx.tmpl: is a directory
14 [2018-08-30T12:31:55] <kayvanbree> thats a big clue
15 [2018-08-30T12:32:02] <kayvanbree> let me check some stuff
16 [2018-08-30T12:32:13] <kayvanbree> and it crashed instantly
17 [2018-08-30T12:34:56] <kayvanbree> On the host,/etc/docker-genisn't even a directory. I guess this is inside the nginx-gen container. Can I use docker-compose to run likedocker exec?
18 [2018-08-30T12:39:40] <kayvanbree> docker-compose exec nginx-gen /bin/shdoesn't work because the container is constantly restarting.

1 [2018-09-02T07:41:43] <thecyberd3m0n_gitlab> HI everyone
2 [2018-09-02T07:43:20] <thecyberd3m0n_gitlab> I'm trying to build image at bitcoin-core base, using Dockerfile with commandFROM kylemanna/bitcoindor others, but getting errors that manifest not found
3 [2018-09-02T07:44:09] <thecyberd3m0n_gitlab> it's little wierd that one of images actually works
4 [2018-09-02T07:46:18] <thecyberd3m0n_gitlab> https://hub.docker.com/r/felixweis/bitcoind/this docker, and simple docker pull also not working
5 [2018-09-02T07:55:51] <thecyberd3m0n_gitlab> I must do something wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-03T07:00:15] <babaorum> thecyberd3m0n_gitlab: have you tried with a specific tag ? Like this : kylemanna/bicoind:0.14
2 [2018-09-03T07:00:47] <babaorum> By defaut docker try with the default tag "latest" but it may not be set by the image
3 [2018-09-03T08:14:39] <babaorum> katsar0v: I think it's related to this : [<-ISSUE->]
4 [2018-09-03T08:16:03] <babaorum> specially this one : [<-LINK->]
5 [2018-09-03T08:26:50] <babaorum> have you seen this : [<-LINK->] ?
6 [2018-09-03T08:27:28] <babaorum> but I feel like it's not a recommanded way to go ...
7 [2018-09-03T08:27:39] <babaorum> but it can help you understand it better
8 [2018-09-03T08:30:11] <babaorum> I think you should experiment some ways to optimize you dockerfile either by creating sub images, or by fusionning some layers
9 [2018-09-03T08:33:14] <babaorum> I think the best way to think about dockerfile layers are in terms of caching. You will generally fusion some instructions this way.
10 [2018-09-03T08:36:11] <katsar0v> Okay, I guess the issue I opened in github required just some more clarification and documentation, why docker has this limits and what can be done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-03T08:04:00] <katsar0v> Hello guys, did anyone saw this issue already? [<-ISSUE->] I found no documentation about it
2 [2018-09-03T08:19:08] <katsar0v> Where are this 125 layers defined? No documentation found. I know the layers are a lot, but inheriting in another image with "FROM" does not help
3 [2018-09-03T08:23:05] <katsar0v> And is there any solution / recommendation to the problem provided? I mean what should I do if I have lot of layers which cannot be really optimized much. Is this an officialdockerlimitation?
4 [2018-09-03T08:30:54] <katsar0v> Also read this https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#minimize-the-number-of-layersI think it is a bit more clear now. Maybe it is better to encapsulate a set of 50 instructions into a shell script and just run it.The problem is that also sub-images do not help, it is the total amount 125 layers from base image that count...
5 [2018-09-03T08:31:40] <katsar0v> If I have an image that has non-sudo user which has its own apps with own settings and permissions, maybe I should not set all this in theDockerfile, as it takes too much layers

1 [2018-09-03T17:54:09] <guiguetz> Can you guys help me on a stuff i couldn't found with Google-Fu? I'm using docker with python and my IDE shows the dependencies/imports on the image as not found in the host. To use properly that feature do i need to install it on the host, or there is a remote way to get this deps? :(

1 [2018-09-04T02:37:58] <milkylee> Good day! I want to ask something about my laravel application using datatable ajax. Running locally, it works and displays all the content of my data but as I run it with docker-compose, it's experiencing 500 error on network console and upon looking on the data, it displays the error SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'offset 0' at line 10. What could be the possible issue?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-04T08:27:36] <OOPMan> Hey all, I have a quick question about volumes, binds and docker-compose. I have a project where I want to bind a specific directory to mount in my container  in read-only mode and then mount writeable volumes in certain sub-directories of the mounted read-only directory. I tried setting this up but got a complaint about the specific location I was mounting the volume to being RO. Is there a way around this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-05T11:05:38] <darrenstarr> HusainMirahmadi_twitter: I know this is a bit late, but yeh... I have absolute faith in Docker on Windows (even though I'm hosting on Linux). It will be even more impressive once Docker for Windows can host both Windows and Linux containers simultaneously using WSL as a replacement for the Linux kernel. I've noticed some action on cgroups emulation in recent WSL builds.
2 [2018-09-05T11:08:00] <darrenstarr> roelzkie15: This is a strange request. I would imagine that you should use localhost for your destination connection. 0.0.0.0 means IP_ANY which means that your container is bound to all interfaces (within the same routing context) on that port. 127.0.0.1 is the loopback for local host you'd like to attach to. Beyond that, you'll want to view the logs for both applications.
3 [2018-09-05T11:10:50] <darrenstarr> guiguetz: I'm pretty confused on many levels about the question. Are you referring to dependencies for an image? Or are you talking about Python dependencies (I.E. stuff pip would fetch)? ... please be more specific. :) As for handling things in Docker remotely,  have you configured TLS connectivity properly and are you using the right certificates?
4 [2018-09-05T11:14:01] <darrenstarr> OOPMan: You were trying to do precisely what I was planning to do as well, so I tried to lab it. I have a strong suspicion that we are both trying to use Docker inappropriately. I think the readonly volumes should be exclusively readonly... then simply make a read-write volume in parallel. There's no real limitation to how large of a scale you can work with here. Also, you're not really trying to make something that looks pretty when you manage it. It's something for software to use. As such, you can make as big of a mess as you'd like and so long as it doesn't make things hard to manage, it's all good. Of course, I realized after the fact that trying to simulate permissions within a tree the way you and I both had hoped would actually make things more difficult to manage and secure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-05T16:39:44] <guiguetz> Well. let me explain a bit of my setup. I started at a company, and I was assigned to a current project, where we are using Docker to build a chatbot, and as it\'s an experimental project, we are kinda of "go-horseing", trying to follow good practices and such, but neither me or my coworker are WELL VERSED on the tech. We are learning stuff as we build it.For local development, we use 2 Windows laptops, with the Docker Quickstart (@ home i got arch with docker) set up. We try to keep the machine as clean as possible of dependencies and other stuff, to avoid having dependency conflicts and any other stuff.Our docker setup is currently made of a compose with images:Django backend;\nPython3 (pika+tornado) websocket\nPython3 (rasa core) NLU/NLP\nNode.js frontend.The idea is to make them all separate to make it easier if need to scale and/or replace any part of our workflow (we currently use kubernetes too, to send them to the cloud).We are using vscode as our main IDE, and it\'s where our problems start.As on our hosts machines we got only python + pip, for instance, any of the - for example - Py3Rasa image dependencies show up in our local code with "red snakes" on our from statements, ctrl clicking stuff to get into the classes isn\'t available and such, which is expected, since our deps which provide that info are all on our image/containers.Our question is if there is a proper way to connect our image dependencies to the IDE, so we can improve our debugging overall, could you understand me? Maybe it\'s something simple, guess maybe I couldn\'t find the proper search keywords/phrasing to explain...There is also, as we\'re on topic of host-image communication: we\'re using different techs in separate images. What is the good practice/way of generating documentation for it? For now, I\'m thinking on have readme.md files in all folders with detailed instruction, but it\'s kinda "manual". Is there any way to wrap our images/compose and try to autodoc them all in a single stuff, or should I focus instead on making something manually?Thanks, friend! :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-05T17:38:37] <alexspence> I'm working on a .net framework app that I want to fully dockerize the build process.  I have a WebApp and a console app that need separate containers.  I currently have dockerfiles that will build the correct docker images once the source is built, but I'm struggling to find the best way to compile the sources inside of a docker container, then build out the other two containers.
2 [2018-09-05T17:40:42] <alexspence> Does anyone have any suggestions here?  I've considered making a root image that compiles the sources as a base image for the other containers, but I'm looking for ideas on best practices here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-05T20:47:09] <rcjsuen> alexspence: Perhaps build stages would help?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-06T04:35:23] <darrenstarr> guiguetz: Wow... this is a really common problem I run into all the time with VSCode. I code almost exclusively on a Surface Book 2 running Windows and WSL. I recently wrote a Linux kernel module in C and also I work almost entirely with C# for the rest of my code... I see a lot of red snakes. There are a few options you have (I'm not a Python expert AT ALL) but one option I can think of is to mount your Python pip cache as a volume to the Docker container which contains your platform. The better option of course is to simply pip as many dependencies as possible to your development machine. If you're using Visual Studio Code with WSL, you can do it pretty much all within the bash shell within Code. However, this is something I think would be extremely good to ask in the Visual Studio Code forums as this is a very common problem for anyone developing server side code.
2 [2018-09-06T04:37:37] <darrenstarr> alexspence: Visual Studio Alex Ellis started the ball rolling a while back on multi-stage building. I'm starting work on that today myself. I'm actually quite bored of building for multiple architectures and having to wait for dotnet restore to complete on each one.
3 [2018-09-06T04:41:18] <darrenstarr> alexspence: Alternatively, Visual Studio with Docker Compose can perform progressive compiles for debugging on Docker. I've looked into this as well, it seems a promising option. It maintains a monster of a container which you pretty much work inside of and every time you compile (even when you just save a file) it rebuilds the container on the fly. That container should never be used in production, so you'd want to properly docker-compose build it instead. But you should seriously be using docker-compose for as much of the work as possible. If you want to connect everything together, you can have a separate composer file which deploys everything with networks and such. In that case, I recommend having a little more robust environment like a Swarm. VS also has support natively for K8S, though I decided K8S is slowly devolving into a mess of trying to be everything to everyone and eventually nothing to anyone. (purely a person and emotional feeling)
4 [2018-09-06T14:36:17] <darrenstarr> tonyx: I would need more information to provide any useful response. Printer discovery happens in many different ways. The most common method in recent times is to make use of Apple Bonjour also known as ZeroConf or in more advanced terms mDNS. mDNS makes use of an enhanced multicast version of DNS with TXT records containing SDP information (If I understand it correctly). The issue you're having is that since you're not within a domain which is routing multicast as though it's on the same site, the mDNS/ZeroConf/Bonjour messages are being squashed between the virtual and the physical networks. On Linux, typically we use Avahi as the mDNS tools. You may want to consider researching how you might create an mDNS proxy between the two networks to allow for printer service discovery.
5 [2018-09-06T14:38:14] <darrenstarr> happyhaha: There's nothing wrong with your configuration so far as I can tell.  Have you tried deleting the stack and redeploying it?
6 [2018-09-07T08:44:21] <darrenstarr> Does anyone know if there's a good way that I can take a container I deployed using deployment mode global and have it both on the overlay network and also expose a port on the physical device? I've written a syslog server which operates on UDP port 514, I want it in a container. And when it receives a syslog message, it relays it to the app server over the overlay network. Any thoughts?
7 [2018-09-10T02:56:24] <darrenstarr> tonyx: I'll still point you towards Avahi which you can run as a docker image. Once you do that, you can configure it as a client which advertises services. The principle would be the same as if you were setting up a web server to pretend to be a web controlled device, but mDNS is its own protocol. If you're using Kubernetes, you should be mindful of the network overlay you're using since I believe (though I'm not sure) that layer-2 solutions such as Flannel can cause excessive flooding on a switch if IGMP snooping isn't properly configured. And layer-3 solutions like Calico may require the underlying network to support multicast, though I believe I've read that in both cases, multicast might be handled through unicast replication. I haven't figured out yet that level of detail about Swarm networks, but I'll have to soon as I'm using Swarm now that it's pretty much surpassed K8S for DIY clouds.
8 [2018-09-11T04:50:59] <darrenstarr> MonXBZH: I don\'t have anything that old to test on, but you should be able to use AUFS tools to get the AUFS tree and then use "docker volume ls | grep -i aufs" to link AUFS volumes to volume names and then use docker inspect... it\'ll be a script more than a one-liner but it shouldn\'t be too bad
9 [2018-09-11T04:52:20] <darrenstarr> rcjsuen: OUcH!!! I just looked at the pricing on ServerDensity, I pay less for my servers than I would pay for server density after 3 months :(
10 [2018-09-11T04:53:38] <darrenstarr> james-shoemaker: have you tried setting it from the GUI manually?
11 [2018-09-11T10:35:50] <rcjsuen> darrenstarr: Yeah, that's their pricing scheme unfortunately
12 [2018-09-11T10:36:17] <rcjsuen> I guess it's working out for them though
13 [2018-09-11T15:13:11] <darrenstarr> alagane: I'm not sure what I would expect to see fromdocker containersif it were a command. There'sdocker psanddocker ps -a. Whatever containers docker knows about are pretty much there. Of course, I sometimes wish there were better commands for filtering.
14 [2018-09-11T15:14:01] <rcjsuen> I think@alaganemeant as an alias maybe
15 [2018-09-11T15:14:06] <alagane> An alias yes
16 [2018-09-11T15:14:25] <rcjsuen> I'm not sure a PR would fly as you can just alias that yourself in yourbashrc
17 [2018-09-11T15:14:40] <darrenstarr> james-shoemaker: That\'s a huge "ouch". I haven\'t tried debugging docker issues like this on Windows for a LONG time. I think I found most of the information of interest in event viewer though since the issue is generally with docker as a service on Windows.

28 [2018-09-11T15:29:03] <darrenstarr> denchp: I'll bite... I'm not sure I'm the pro on the topic, but can you clarify? Are you trying to run SQL server as a container or do you have an application that you'd like to run in a container?
29 [2018-09-11T15:29:35] <darrenstarr> james-shoemaker: Do you have any weird drives mounted on your machine? Something like a network share as a drive?
30 [2018-09-11T15:36:54] <james-shoemaker> darrenstarr: nothing odd drive wise that I know of.  I'm on a corporate network with the associated policies, but other users in my group have no issues with docker.  I just upgraded to windows 10 and installed the newer docker and now nothing works.  about to install docker toolbox so I can get back to work (assuming it works with windows 10).
31 [2018-09-11T15:41:54] <darrenstarr> james-shoemaker: I wish you luck. Sadly I struggled with a similar issue when I started using Docker on Windows 10 and I'm sorry I can't recall how I managed to finally solve it. I have no idea why they felt the need to add that GUI anyway, I haven't used it for anything other than to share the drive and kill the app
32 [2018-09-11T15:45:35] <darrenstarr> denchp: Well, to be honest, SQL server is not the best thing to run virtualized... too many people do that and all it does is waste money in the end. MSSQL is a dying thing anyway as it's not really a scale-out platform for scaling. There are real limits to how many customers they could put on a single cluster in the cloud. Azure Tables is their hot thing now... so while MS probably makes billions on SQL server these days, I would be shocked if the top level management cares whether it lives or dies in the future as it's legacy technology compared to tables.

34 [2018-09-11T15:46:04] <darrenstarr> You should be able to simply provide a connection string to the application and let it run as it would have outside of a container
35 [2018-09-11T15:46:18] <darrenstarr> Is the issue with connection strings and authentication information?
36 [2018-09-11T15:52:42] <darrenstarr> Hmmm... ok... so the issue is that you either need to install the MSSQL ODBC driver or find a container with it preinstalled. This is NOT the best article... but it's the best I've found so far and it explains how to do it with postgresql.... let's see if I can find mssql [<-LINK->]
37 [2018-09-11T15:57:38] <darrenstarr> denchp: Ok... this is probably what you need.... I would recommend making two docker images. The first would be your platform and the second would be your application. So think of it as your own base image. Create a dockerfile that uses the base image of Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server... then download the driver and install it by using ADD and RUN commands to do what's seen here [<-LINK->]
38 [2018-09-11T15:58:04] <darrenstarr> denchp: Then make your application point to that image as its base. You should be ok then.
39 [2018-09-11T17:32:27] <james-shoemaker> darrenstarr: running some more windows updates resolved the issue
40 [2018-09-12T05:26:00] <darrenstarr> AnderssonPeter: yesterday, I solved a problem someone else had been struggling on for hours by rebooting a Windows 7 machine... it seemed silly, but it these were highly technical people sometimes ignore the obvious. Can I ask you what it says if you kill all copies of the container (remove the service) and then run the netstat command again. Does it show the same result? I've had this problem so many times and it ends up being something silly like I forgot I was already running another copy.

1 [2018-09-06T09:30:56] <tonyx> morning: I have a web app based on postgres and mono, and when I run it in the real machine, it can detects printers. I can dockerize the app, using docker-compose, but I haven't been able to use the printer from the dockerized app, yet, and I am looking for some suggestion, if someone can  kind enough to give me some. Grazie.
2 [2018-09-09T07:22:06] <tonyx> thanks @darrenstarrI\'d like to find the simplest solution that may work, with the simplest steps.For example:First step could be: at least being able to emulate a printer in the "docker virtual machine", changing thedocker-compose.yml file at it, in that way at least when the program try to discover the printer, then it will find something instead of giving an error.Second step would be making the the real printer visible from the "docker virtual machine", and from the app that runs in it (and I know that the discovery printers works if I run the app in the "real" machine).

2 [2018-09-10T01:04:30] <Ne0nx3r0> Kind of like Portainer, but I don't care as much about administration as reporting

1 [2018-09-10T10:52:41] <rcjsuen> Ne0nx3r0: You can try DataDog or ServerDensity. SD is cheaper but not as popular.
2 [2018-09-10T10:54:41] <rcjsuen> And of course, cAdvisor/Prometheus/Grafana is always an option. You should keep auth in mind if you are using cAdvisor though (especially if your host is accessible via the public).

2 [2018-09-11T15:39:23] <denchp> darrenstarr: I've got the app containerized, but the SQL Server instance is running on a separate server.  Right now it's a development database, but it's 'run' by our enterprise DBAs, and they aren't... uh... forward thinking... so it's unlikely to be containerized any time soon.

1 [2018-09-13T07:06:22] <Dinodanio> Hey all. Container using their name as hostname by default and the docker documentation says, we should use underscores in the name for readability. But underscores in hostnames are not allowed by RFC.
2 [2018-09-13T07:06:41] <Dinodanio> That seems weird
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-13T14:22:10] <tstackhouse_gitlab> Ritin: check your config for mon-exp. That error message says it's trying to connect to the host 'mongo', but you've renamed your mongo instance to 'mon', so the container name will be mon and that will be the hostname that you'll need to connect to from the mon-exp container
2 [2018-09-13T14:23:30] <tstackhouse_gitlab> So there are 2 solutions: Edit the config that themon-expservice uses to connect tomoninstead ofmongoor addcontainer_name: mongoto your compose file under themonservice.

1 [2018-09-25T14:54:34] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Hey people, I\'m new to docker, and I\'m at a loss :|I think that what I want to do should be simple, but it\'s confusing me to death.Case:I have an application, I want to run some unit tests against a database, but I want to make sure that the unit tests don\'t affect the "real" database. So my idea was: create a mysql dockerfile, initialize my schema in the db, and destroy&restart the container after every unit test to start with a fresh db.Of course, this means that the whole thing needs to be fast. [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-09-25T14:58:16] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I thought I should be able to do this: [<-CODE->] But then when I restart it, the image will just run all the scripts in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d again
3 [2018-09-25T14:58:28] <Martijngripp_gitlab> adaliszk: Yeah that's my goal, I don't know how :x
4 [2018-09-25T15:00:58] <Martijngripp_gitlab> While I think that'd work, that doesn't sound very convenient
5 [2018-09-25T15:01:05] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Our db schema changes every now and then
6 [2018-09-25T15:01:13] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And I'd have to do that manually every time
7 [2018-09-25T15:01:31] <adaliszk> but when you commit then it doesn't commit into the main image, it creates a new image to my knowledge
8 [2018-09-25T15:01:37] <Martijngripp_gitlab> yeah that's fine
9 [2018-09-25T15:01:51] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But it just reinitializes the db
10 [2018-09-25T15:02:01] <Martijngripp_gitlab> It doesn't take into account that the db is already initialized
11 [2018-09-25T15:02:08] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Which is super weird
12 [2018-09-25T15:02:36] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I'll try this again
13 [2018-09-25T15:02:44] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And look into preventing the initialization script this time
14 [2018-09-25T15:02:51] <Martijngripp_gitlab> but I don't have high hopes
15 [2018-09-25T15:02:57] <adaliszk> weird :/ normally a db image uses a volume so it does not need the reinitialize itself
16 [2018-09-25T15:03:15] <Martijngripp_gitlab> It's like I tried 6 different things, and everything I try ends up not working because of something I don't understand
17 [2018-09-25T15:03:16] <Martijngripp_gitlab> :((
18 [2018-09-25T15:04:08] <adaliszk> I know that feeling :)

20 [2018-09-25T15:07:28] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Another thing I tried was to simply initialize the database in the dockerfile itself, withmysql -u root -proot < /myinitfile.sql
21 [2018-09-25T15:07:34] <adaliszk> oh, soo the reinitialization could be because the image still have files in the/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
22 [2018-09-25T15:07:41] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But that just doesn't do anythingat all
23 [2018-09-25T15:08:04] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Like I attach a terminal to the container, and the database is not even there
24 [2018-09-25T15:08:09] <Martijngripp_gitlab> so weird
25 [2018-09-25T15:08:17] <adaliszk> its normally in a volume
26 [2018-09-25T15:08:39] <adaliszk> hmm, try to configure mysql to use a different db location
27 [2018-09-25T15:09:21] <Martijngripp_gitlab> @babaorumI tried this in my dockerfile [<-CODE->]
28 [2018-09-25T15:09:24] <adaliszk> datadirinmysqld.cnf
29 [2018-09-25T15:10:41] <Martijngripp_gitlab>  [<-CODE->] That would make sense, I can add a script that empties that folder after initializing, and then use commit
30 [2018-09-25T15:12:30] <Martijngripp_gitlab>  [<-CODE->] I\'m also still a bit confused about volumes, I don\'t really have a solid understanding of them whatsoever, best I understand them is a vague feeling of "Somewhat like a mount except not a mount that floats around somewhere in the docker-aether"
31 [2018-09-25T15:18:49] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Lol, something's got to be off here
32 [2018-09-25T15:18:56] <Martijngripp_gitlab>  [<-CODE->]
33 [2018-09-25T15:19:16] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I added a script that clears the init folder
34 [2018-09-25T15:28:30] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Ok ... wait, whatever it is that's going wrong now, I'm using weird workarounds to clear the folder after initialization which it apparently doesn't like because it's giving me permissions errors; it's a hack anyway.Can you do something like this with volumes?Bind a volume to the container\nLet the container init\nFreeze the volume somehow, copy it/store it/name it/whatever\nStart a container with a copy of that volume
35 [2018-09-25T15:29:50] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Because supposedly, the init scripts should run only once... [<-CODE->]
36 [2018-09-25T15:30:05] <Martijngripp_gitlab> ;_;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-25T14:57:41] <adaliszk> Hmm, what you could do is to save the actual database into the image so every time when you run it it's already has the data without initialization
2 [2018-09-25T15:00:09] <adaliszk> I would run the containerinitialize the databasesave out the files in mysql case/var/lib/mysqlcreate a dockerfile with a COPY so I have the dband build that as an image
3 [2018-09-25T15:00:51] <adaliszk> It should working with commit though
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-25T15:06:30] <babaorum> I am not sure I followed all the conversation. But I think it is an interesting topic. If you want to initialize your db this way. You would need to make sure all "initial" set up si done in your image, and only starting the database remain in your container starting
2 [2018-09-25T15:50:59] <babaorum> I didn't know this docker image, did you tried it ?
3 [2018-09-25T15:51:11] <babaorum> seems to be what you want to do ...
4 [2018-09-25T15:54:03] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Yeah I'm trying it out right now
5 [2018-09-25T15:55:17] <babaorum> I personaly would not use it on the long term because it seems a bit too custom for me.But for a first approach of the functionality; it seems to be a good start :)
6 [2018-09-25T15:55:38] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Yeah it's a bit obscure if you ask me
7 [2018-09-25T15:55:45] <Martijngripp_gitlab> but atm, seems the right choice if I can get it working
8 [2018-09-25T15:55:56] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Alright, so itisat least running
9 [2018-09-25T15:56:05] <Martijngripp_gitlab> and my database is even initialised correctly
10 [2018-09-25T15:56:11] <Martijngripp_gitlab> but it still takes like 4 seconds to start up
11 [2018-09-25T15:56:18] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Which is somewhat ok for now, our testsuite is not super large
12 [2018-09-25T15:56:26] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But that'll get annoying really, really quickly
13 [2018-09-25T15:56:33] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Should really be sub-second
14 [2018-09-25T15:57:34] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And the repo promises to be sub-second as well
15 [2018-09-25T15:57:35] <Martijngripp_gitlab> So eh
16 [2018-09-25T15:57:36] <Martijngripp_gitlab> hm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-25T15:36:46] <adaliszk> you can mount the volume for the first run to initialize
2 [2018-09-25T15:36:53] <adaliszk> then mount it as readonly
3 [2018-09-25T15:37:27] <adaliszk> the datadir move would make sure that the database is not stored in a volume
4 [2018-09-25T15:38:15] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Would that imply that I can't write to the db?
5 [2018-09-25T15:39:21] <adaliszk> with the readonly yeah :D
6 [2018-09-25T15:39:37] <adaliszk> but the location could be like /tmp
7 [2018-09-25T15:39:55] <adaliszk> normally the docker container processes run as root in their container
8 [2018-09-25T15:39:57] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Hmm.. I need to be able to modify the db tho ;p
9 [2018-09-25T15:42:39] <adaliszk> A question though, wouldn't be more effective to initialize a database and create a copy from that database for the tests?
10 [2018-09-25T15:43:34] <Martijngripp_gitlab> .. how? ;_;
11 [2018-09-25T15:43:55] <adaliszk> like amysqldump base_database | mysql test1command before you start your tests
12 [2018-09-25T15:44:03] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I don't care what steps I have to take, I just want it to work without it being super super complicated
13 [2018-09-25T15:44:18] <Martijngripp_gitlab> initializing the db takes 15 seconds on my host pc
14 [2018-09-25T15:44:31] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Considering I'd have to reset the db for every unit test suite
15 [2018-09-25T15:44:37] <Martijngripp_gitlab> That'd be a huge waste of time
16 [2018-09-25T15:44:40] <Martijngripp_gitlab> That's why I want to use docker
17 [2018-09-25T15:45:03] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Have some kind of restartable image/container that will just give me a fresh database every time I run some random command
18 [2018-09-25T15:45:42] <adaliszk> It still needs to start so a 3-5s will be there anyway
19 [2018-09-25T15:45:58] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Well, not necessarily, there's  this thing for example: [<-LINK->]
20 [2018-09-25T15:46:05] <Martijngripp_gitlab> It starts very quickly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-25T16:00:52] <adaliszk> depends on machine, I have an NVME SSD and that makes way bigger images start bellow a second ;)
2 [2018-09-25T16:01:30] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Haha, my desktop has a samsung 950 pro NVME SSD as well
3 [2018-09-25T16:01:36] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Buuuttt.. that's my personal desktop
4 [2018-09-25T16:01:36] <babaorum> Wait to use it on a CI system or something
5 [2018-09-25T16:01:46] <Martijngripp_gitlab> This pc has a regular ssd
6 [2018-09-25T16:02:11] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But this pc shouldn't be anywhere near slow, it's fairly beefy
7 [2018-09-25T16:03:11] <babaorum> If you want to have a new database for each functional tests. it is quite normal to have these kind of issues
8 [2018-09-25T16:03:41] <adaliszk> yeah, but on a CI server you can just put them parallel to each other
9 [2018-09-25T16:03:54] <adaliszk> so the test is just as long as your biggest test
10 [2018-09-25T16:04:37] <Martijngripp_gitlab> babaorum: I think I can live with 3-4 seconds startup time for now though
11 [2018-09-25T16:05:03] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Our test-suite is so small atm that I can get away with only starting it up once, at the very beginning
12 [2018-09-25T16:05:23] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And once we get to the point where it gets a bit bigger, I can spend some more time trying to optimize this image
13 [2018-09-25T16:05:32] <Martijngripp_gitlab> 3-4 seconds is already so, so much better than 15
14 [2018-09-25T16:06:05] <Martijngripp_gitlab> A major point of unit tests is that they give immediate feedback, and 3-4 seconds is "immediate" enough for me
15 [2018-09-25T16:06:18] <Martijngripp_gitlab> 15 is definitely not, you might as well not have unit tests at that point
16 [2018-09-25T16:07:12] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And I'm pretty sure there has to be something simple right now I can do to speed it up a bit more
17 [2018-09-25T16:09:15] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Well.. our codebase is such a big mess, it makes more sense to spin up a database than to even pretend it's worth our time to hold our testing code to high standards
18 [2018-09-25T16:09:43] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Our code is not exactly "mock-friendly"
19 [2018-09-25T16:10:28] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And I cannot change like 90% of the architecture, because it is generated by some kind of a custom scaffolding tool made by the CTO
20 [2018-09-25T16:10:36] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I just want to be able to run tests ASAP
21 [2018-09-25T16:10:45] <Martijngripp_gitlab> So I can refactor some stuff where it is more than extremely necessary
22 [2018-09-25T16:11:04] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Clients are complaining that features that we've been working on formonthskeep breaking due to regressions all over the place
23 [2018-09-25T16:11:10] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And I can try my best to refactor the code
24 [2018-09-25T16:11:29] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But it's basically guaranteed that I breaksomething..somewherewhenever I do something
25 [2018-09-25T16:11:42] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Which I'll hear about a week later, because a client is complaining
26 [2018-09-25T16:12:13] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And the cto & boss don't really give a fuck about code stability, CTO doesn't believe in tests
27 [2018-09-25T16:12:28] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But I just need something to cover my own ass, because if I break stuff it's my fault again, lol
28 [2018-09-25T16:12:30] <Martijngripp_gitlab> So yeah
29 [2018-09-25T16:12:34] <Martijngripp_gitlab> That's my life story
30 [2018-09-25T16:13:16] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Yeah...It's my life...In my own words, I guess...
31 [2018-09-25T16:14:32] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Have you ever loved a codebase so much you'd give an arm for?Not the expressionNo, literally give an arm forWhen they know they're your income and you know you were their developerAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm herBut what happens when regression-errorsTurn right around and bite youAnd everything you committed turns on you despite youWhat happens when you become the main source of bugs
32 [2018-09-25T16:16:49] <adaliszk> one sec, I need to read it XD
33 [2018-09-25T16:17:30] <adaliszk> Wow you got an interesting CTO there :D
34 [2018-09-25T16:17:43] <Martijngripp_gitlab> He's a bit stuck in his ways
35 [2018-09-25T16:17:59] <Martijngripp_gitlab> The scaffolding thing makes sense for their business, or at least, it used to
36 [2018-09-25T16:18:20] <Martijngripp_gitlab> They used to make custom applications for a whole bunch of different clietns
37 [2018-09-25T16:18:32] <Martijngripp_gitlab> So they could use it to prototype applciations super quickly using it
38 [2018-09-25T16:18:32] <adaliszk> happens, but I can understand when the customers are complaining the focus is not on the tests
39 [2018-09-25T16:19:01] <Martijngripp_gitlab> I think they're just too used to their way of working and that their application is like in a state of being 60-70% stable
40 [2018-09-25T16:19:07] <Martijngripp_gitlab> Most of it works most of the times for most customers
41 [2018-09-25T16:19:20] <Martijngripp_gitlab> And they let us fix bugs whenever something goes wrong I guess
42 [2018-09-25T16:19:41] <Martijngripp_gitlab> But.. if the three of us add a unit test or three each week, wherever it is important
43 [2018-09-25T16:19:56] <adaliszk> yeah, but in the mean time we should not span this channel though ;)
44 [2018-09-25T16:20:02] <Martijngripp_gitlab> oh yeah
45 [2018-09-25T16:20:02] <Martijngripp_gitlab> lol
46 [2018-09-25T16:20:20] <adaliszk> :D
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-25T16:08:14] <adaliszk> unit tests should not spin up database though, the current project where I work on we have over 800 tests and only a few actually need a database to validate that the framework was able to connect and the migrated database is ok
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T00:15:32] <davidmichaelkarr> I\'m trying to help another team with a container problem. Their Dockerfile is exposing port 8080. When they do a docker inspect, the "NetworkSettings.Ports" is null.  What sort of thing should we look at for troubleshooting?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T10:05:22] <darrenstarr> David... dumb question here... you're both exposing the port from the container and also from the system right? So when launching the container, you're specifying the port should be exposed and that's the same port you expose when building the container right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T12:34:39] <user2301> Hi , How to correctly add new path in windows docker container? I tried various combinations but not working. How to verify if the path is added to the enviornment variable inside docker container?
2 [2018-09-26T12:38:30] <user2301>  [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T16:04:12] <denchp> So I asked this a few weeks ago, but am just now able to come back to the skunkworks project we're trying to do (which is general containerization).Here's the short version: expressjs app that uses mssql/msnodesqlv8 to connect to an external MSSQL instance.The app work running locally - but won't work in the container, and I'm getting the following message:(node:1356) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: ConnectionError: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified    at msnodesql.open (C:\\usr\\node_modules\\mssql\\lib\\msnodesqlv8.js:178:17)    at Immediate._onImmediate (C:\\usr\\node_modules\\msnodesqlv8\\lib\\connection.js:358:15)    at runCallback (timers.js:810:20)    at tryOnImmediate (timers.js:768:5)    at processImmediate [as _immediateCallback] (timers.js:745:5)I can't figure this out for the life of me...
2 [2018-09-26T16:54:06] <denchp> the image is built off of windowsservercore:1708
3 [2018-09-26T17:10:29] <denchp> OK!!! I got it to work - kind of!
4 [2018-09-26T17:12:14] <denchp> I\'m now getting ":ogin failed for user \'NT AUTHORITY\\ANONYMOUS LOGON\'."  Which is an improvement.
5 [2018-09-26T17:35:14] <denchp> So my new challenge is to get a container to run as a specific user...  Any ideas on how to achieve that?
6 [2018-09-26T17:56:50] <denchp> Or more accurately, I need the process inside of the container to run as a specific user...
7 [2018-09-26T18:03:37] <denchp> That's actually what I'm investigating right now
8 [2018-09-26T18:03:52] <denchp> Trying to figure out if/how to connect up to the AD...
9 [2018-09-26T18:34:37] <denchp> So it looks like I might be able to get this working by using USER 'LocalService' in the DockerFile and --user 'domain/username' in the run command...  can anyone confirm?
10 [2018-09-27T16:02:33] <denchp> From what I'm reading the only solution to getting a container to connect to an MSSQL instance using integrated security (Windows Authentication) is through setting up a gMSA.  Is this really the only way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T16:30:13] <adaliszk> what host do you use in order to connect?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-26T18:02:04] <rcjsuen> denchp: TheUSERDockerfile instruction does not help?
2 [2018-09-28T13:07:51] <rcjsuen> katsar0v: But there are 90 other steps before it
3 [2018-09-28T13:08:27] <rcjsuen> I think that's what Adam is getting at
4 [2018-09-28T14:19:56] <rcjsuen> It sounds like it should be possible to reproduce bytouching a bajillion files, ortouch100 files and thencp -ra thousand times.
5 [2018-09-28T14:20:04] <rcjsuen> Are a bajilliion files in one folder the problem or many folders with many files?
6 [2018-09-28T14:22:24] <adaliszk> Usually the many folder many files takes a lot of time, if you have a folder with bajillion files that's not a huge problem
7 [2018-09-28T14:22:27] <katsar0v> Use this file fore testing, it is also slow: [<-CODE->]
8 [2018-09-28T14:22:42] <katsar0v> I cannot post my fullDockerfile, but the above is a good example
9 [2018-09-28T14:23:29] <katsar0v> You can count the files, etc.. this is just not normal, whatever happens withchown, on the host machine it lasts less than0,001s
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-27T07:56:17] <adaliszk> if I know right--userflag will copy your local user details into the container. I'm not sure if it handles the kerberos tokens though :D
2 [2018-09-27T11:35:40] <adaliszk> ^ in that regard it usually clearly throws an error that it is a certificate error, hanging is a weird issue, I only experienced it when my registry had a proxy
3 [2018-09-27T11:38:47] <adaliszk> try use the registry:2 instead latest
4 [2018-09-27T11:39:02] <adaliszk> I've had some error with the latest recently
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-27T10:22:58] <limpep> Hi all, I have version:  18.06.1-ce installed on a arm box, I am having an issue pushing the image to a private register for someone reason it hangs pushing to the registry, I have logged in and restarted the docker service but with no luck
2 [2018-09-27T10:23:04] <limpep> not sure what i am doing wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-27T11:30:20] <darrenstarr> limpep: not sure if I can help... but I've done this a lot. Just so you know... the whole pushing to a private registry tends to go completely crappy when your certificates aren't valid
2 [2018-09-27T11:40:24] <darrenstarr> I haven't tried that... but I found that simply getting a properly signed certificate in place fixes pretty much everything

1 [2018-09-27T19:45:39] <elcolie> Hi
2 [2018-09-27T19:45:58] <elcolie> After I use remote python interpreter inPyCharm
3 [2018-09-27T19:46:31] <elcolie> My test break and I have to do manually run the test without docker
4 [2018-09-27T19:46:50] <elcolie> ThenPyCharm_helpercontainer is exited.
5 [2018-09-27T19:47:09] <elcolie>  [<-CODE->] What should I do with them?kill/jump to the container?
6 [2018-09-28T03:09:13] <elcolie> docker system prunesolve for me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T11:56:58] <katsar0v> Any docker dev (for linux), please take a look, as I think this is important - [<-ISSUE->]
2 [2018-09-28T11:58:03] <katsar0v> ping to the contributors@thaJeztah@tiborvass
3 [2018-09-28T12:58:52] <adaliszk> can you attach your Dockerfile too? :)
4 [2018-09-28T12:59:26] <adaliszk> Step 91/95 smells a bit :D
5 [2018-09-28T13:04:18] <katsar0v> Step 91/95 : WORKDIR /var/www/html/it is just a workdir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T13:58:44] <adaliszk> Yes. Even with multistage build the max number was what I as able to hit is 40, aand that's a really huge project.
2 [2018-09-28T14:05:16] <adaliszk> Not saying that your 95 steps it not needed, but hard to pinpoint out why is a chmod slow without knowing what do you do before that.For example you could chmod the sources and change the user before a composer install and that's helps a lot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T14:24:22] <adaliszk> Have you considered using [<-LINK->] and composer for your plugins and the wordpress to install? That way you don't need to copy and chown everything, only your theme and maybe your static files (if stored on the same container)
2 [2018-09-28T14:25:13] <katsar0v> What about local ones which are private and with changes?
3 [2018-09-28T14:25:27] <katsar0v> However, that's just an example with Wordpress plugins, use any other files
4 [2018-09-28T14:25:47] <adaliszk> composer gives you configurable repositories, that's how I work with my WP containers :)
5 [2018-09-28T14:26:19] <katsar0v> Cool, will take a look at it :)
6 [2018-09-28T14:28:25] <adaliszk> A sample composer.json: [<-CODE->] With that you only need to copy your config and custom theme into the container which should not take too much time to chmod :)
7 [2018-09-28T14:29:13] <katsar0v> That's a cool workaround! But what if I do not want to use wpackagist, I have my private gitlab and github repos for example where my plugins are sorted
8 [2018-09-28T14:32:30] <adaliszk>  [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-09-28T14:32:59] <adaliszk> in your repos you just choose the type to bewordpress-themeorwordpress-plugin
10 [2018-09-28T14:33:09] <adaliszk> aand your 95 steps could be reduced to about 20 :)
11 [2018-09-28T14:34:13] <adaliszk> but we should discuss the composer details in a separate channel or in private so we won't spam the docker channel with it ;)
12 [2018-09-28T14:34:44] <katsar0v> Yeah, that's nice! But in similar cases you always need additional setups for authentication
13 [2018-09-28T14:34:50] <katsar0v> to the private repos.. etc
14 [2018-09-28T14:35:43] <katsar0v> Of course I could also just put a/start.shscript that does everything at the end and my Dockerfile is just 2 lines. Dockerfile should not be really limited to 100 or 1000 lines
15 [2018-09-28T14:37:55] <katsar0v> But thanks for the tips! Will for sure take this in mind.If any technical limitations from the Dockerfile exist, they need to be documented (e.g. cannot be more than around 120 lines)Also similar documentation like - https://success.docker.com/article/mta-best-practices - would be nice for creating nice Dockerfiles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T14:40:54] <adaliszk> Yeah true that there is no limitation, but a container should encapsulate "one process" , I often seens this huge files to encapsulate a project and not one service. After the official repos has any database you want, any cache mechanism, any webserver and in this case you only need to setup a php-fpm and put your files into it.
2 [2018-09-28T14:41:03] <adaliszk> *seen
3 [2018-09-28T14:41:21] <adaliszk> -After
4 [2018-09-28T14:41:26] <adaliszk> I cannot write on Friday XD
5 [2018-09-28T14:45:03] <adaliszk> I've played around with [<-LINK->] before which might help with that many files, If I know right it's basically masking your files to look like what you permission needed to be
6 [2018-09-28T14:45:24] <adaliszk> that way you don't even need to modify permissions
7 [2018-09-28T14:45:52] <katsar0v> Thanks for the link!
8 [2018-09-28T14:46:01] <adaliszk> but that doesn't help if you are not on linux
9 [2018-09-28T14:46:03] <adaliszk> :D
10 [2018-09-28T14:46:37] <katsar0v> But don't you think, chown inside docker and chown on host machine, they are just not comparable
11 [2018-09-28T14:46:55] <rcjsuen> I agree it should not be that different
12 [2018-09-28T14:47:38] <adaliszk> depends on your volume configuration I guess, if it tries to rsync in the background that's not a small overhead
13 [2018-09-28T14:47:52] <katsar0v> I mean everything you said is true@adaliszk, but such a simple operation (well maybe not that simple at all) should not take that long onNVMe SSDwith RAID 0 :)
14 [2018-09-28T14:48:01] <katsar0v> Mine is default, clear docker config, no idea honestly
15 [2018-09-28T14:49:15] <adaliszk> Hmm, an interesting test could be to work with alpine instead of ubuntu as a base image. I've noticed significant differences between them before
16 [2018-09-28T14:49:40] <rcjsuen> I just ran your file inplay-with-docker.com
17 [2018-09-28T14:49:41] <rcjsuen> Already finished
18 [2018-09-28T14:49:53] <rcjsuen> chown test:test . -Rprobably took less than five seconds
19 [2018-09-28T14:49:56] <rcjsuen> rcjsuen: shrugs.
20 [2018-09-28T14:50:09] <rcjsuen> But I don't know what cloud infra PWD is run on so...
21 [2018-09-28T14:54:07] <rcjsuen> alpine:3.8perhaps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T14:52:14] <katsar0v> That would be a cool try I guess, I will try switching the image, so instead of ubuntu I try alpine or something else. Which images can I use as base?
2 [2018-09-28T14:59:56] <katsar0v> ahh it is all different with adding the user and so on.. maybe the repos are also different for all the apps..
3 [2018-09-28T15:00:24] <rcjsuen> Alpine doesn't useapt, so yes you will need to massage your Dockerfile accordingly
4 [2018-09-28T15:03:14] <katsar0v> Around 5-7 seconds onAlpine
5 [2018-09-28T15:05:02] <katsar0v> Alpine: [<-CODE->] Debian: [<-CODE->]
6 [2018-09-28T15:07:23] <katsar0v> Ubuntu 18.04: [<-CODE->]
7 [2018-09-28T15:08:10] <adaliszk> somewhat better :D
8 [2018-09-28T15:10:21] <katsar0v> :D
9 [2018-09-28T15:12:54] <katsar0v> Your tips helped me though, thank you for which :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T15:16:39] <denchp> I'm getting an error when trying to use a docker-compose file...:ERROR: for mongo  Cannot create container for service mongo: invalid volume specification: 'C:_projects\\discovery-service\\mongodb\\data:/data/db:rw'
2 [2018-09-28T15:16:52] <denchp> Anyone have any ideas (the windows path is valid)
3 [2018-09-28T15:17:20] <denchp> (using the official mongodb dockerfile)
4 [2018-09-28T15:18:41] <katsar0v> denchp: can you separate the windows path from /data and :rw
5 [2018-09-28T15:19:23] <katsar0v> I do it like this ['c:/..path..','/mount-path/','rw'] (in python)
6 [2018-09-28T15:19:32] <denchp> Hmm...
7 [2018-09-28T15:19:34] <denchp> I'll try

11 [2018-09-28T15:20:53] <denchp> services.mongo.volumes contains an invalid type, it should be a string, or an object

16 [2018-09-28T15:24:04] <denchp> It seems to be resolving the ./mongodb/data properly to c:_projects\\etc...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T15:21:49] <adaliszk> ./only works for me if I write the whole config as a string. At some point docker-compose (and docker) started to require absolute path
2 [2018-10-02T13:41:18] <adaliszk> you have two generic direction@pgreisen, one is to usedocker cpwhich enables you copy files from the container to the host, the second is to use avolumeand essentially work on your host with your container.
3 [2018-10-02T14:46:05] <adaliszk> volume is the most commonly used solution, you can point that into your given workdir and then you can process stuff in your container and get the results in your host machine. The cp is mostly used if you need some state like default configs to later copy back with your configuration (in Dockerfile).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-09-28T16:06:20] <fridgerator> I ran docker-compose with some missing dot files as volumes (.eslintrc), I've added those missing files in but now my container thinks those volumes are folders.  How can I fix this?
2 [2018-09-28T17:29:44] <fridgerator> nvmd, I pruned everything and still get the error, I have to be doing something wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-01T19:34:31] <jmunson> I have two stacks deployed to a docker swarm, but I can't seem to get DNS to resolve a container on the other stack. The documentation mentions that containername.stackname should work, but its documentation for docker-cloud so it might just not apply to swarm mode? I can't seem to find any swarm-mode specific documentation on how to do this. Does anyone know how?

1 [2018-10-02T13:31:47] <pgreisen> I have built a docker image which generates some data which I would like to transfer to host. I generate some data inside the container and I would like to copy them to ./data after the run. Could someone give a hint or link to how to do this. Thanks
2 [2018-10-02T14:38:55] <pgreisen> thanks - so what is the most sustainable solution here. At some point I would like to wrap singularity around the container but I am bit uncertain what is the design for this
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-02T18:54:40] <dragonpiper> for some reason my network performance in a docker container is extremly slow 20 KB / s . Cpu and memory usage for the container is pretty low. Anyone know if this is normal ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-03T08:24:36] <lanycrost> dragonpiper: can you sharedocker inspectoutput, I think it is because of cgroups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-03T10:43:25] <sumanchowdare> How can we access docker cli from inside container ??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-03T11:02:34] <lanycrost> sumanchowdare: You can mount root directory, or just mount docker.sock for control docker inside container, but I think you can find more graceful solution :)

1 [2018-10-05T20:19:32] <dragonpiper> Hello, I have a question about multistage builds
2 [2018-10-05T20:21:25] <dragonpiper> does it mean instead of having a 1Gb that includes the tooling needed for compiling my code i can just have a stage that creates build artifacts and just have those build artifacts copied over to final image from base from alphine  that doen't have the language compilation dependencies  ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-05T20:42:38] <stephansnyt> is there a way to do uid mapping between a host and container so that the id of the user running the container  is equal to the last USER defined in the corresponding Dockerfile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-05T22:07:16] <tbugfinder> dragonpiper: "from python" is a Linux container.

2 [2018-10-05T23:12:07] <spdevhub07> If you do two from blocks you can copy from first stage artifacts to second stage without carrying all of it

1 [2018-10-06T21:33:57] <pbaderia01> Hey..any idea how I can execute mongodb tasks as a cron job in a docker image?
2 [2018-10-06T21:34:14] <pbaderia01> I have pulled the latest ubuntu image
3 [2018-10-06T21:34:33] <bizmate> you dont, you run a cron that runs a container
4 [2018-10-06T21:35:16] <pbaderia01> But that would mean I have to reset the mongo connection every single time
5 [2018-10-06T21:35:44] <pbaderia01> I won't be able to execute the same queries on the same command
6 [2018-10-06T21:35:52] <pbaderia01> *connection
7 [2018-10-06T21:36:58] <bizmate> I dont see the benefit of keeping a connection open if it is not running a query
8 [2018-10-06T21:37:10] <bizmate> could you clarify what you are trying to achieve?
9 [2018-10-06T21:37:54] <pbaderia01> I am trying to run a cleanup query for my db but since I don't wanna block the production db for a very long time in a single go
10 [2018-10-06T21:38:25] <pbaderia01> I am trying to retrieve a limited number of documents every 10 seconds and deleting them
11 [2018-10-06T21:38:52] <pbaderia01> In batches
12 [2018-10-06T21:39:11] <pbaderia01> For this I am trying to build a docker image that I can expose to kube to execute
13 [2018-10-06T21:39:46] <pbaderia01> But I can't get my head around as to how I can execute queries on the mongo terminal using a cron job in a container
14 [2018-10-06T21:40:14] <bizmate> then you dont need a cron job, just run an app that does the queries with a 10 second sleep for ever
15 [2018-10-06T21:40:38] <bizmate> thought the approach feels like you should fix what causes the garbage data in the first place with something built in in mongo
16 [2018-10-06T21:40:51] <bizmate> rather than running queries later
17 [2018-10-06T21:40:59] <pbaderia01> Also trying to do that with a TTL index
18 [2018-10-06T21:41:09] <pbaderia01> But since the data is too much right now
19 [2018-10-06T21:41:28] <pbaderia01> Can't really because it will throttle the DB and would cause havoc
20 [2018-10-06T21:42:11] <pbaderia01> Thanks for the help@bizmate. Really appreciate it
21 [2018-10-06T21:42:27] <bizmate> no problem, does the sleep approach make sense? you dont need a cron
22 [2018-10-06T21:42:37] <bizmate> in my opinion
23 [2018-10-06T21:42:54] <pbaderia01> Yup..it does as a matter of fact
24 [2018-10-06T21:43:07] <bizmate> cool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-08T05:41:37] <mateothegreat> I’d recommend using a cron based job so you don’t have to worry about maintaining a stateful connection for a long running job

1 [2018-10-08T10:35:31] <devMonkey87> hi everyone! got a little issue , hope maybe someone could help
2 [2018-10-08T10:38:51] <devMonkey87> the situation is: working with a physical device running an ubuntu server via VirtualBox. The ubuntu server is executing a jenkins container. Before the issue  I was running virtualBox on Bridge mode with no problems of finding every machine but when I switched to my work office environment and changed the connection to NAT, can't reach  any IP apart from the virtualised Ubuntu Server machine...
3 [2018-10-08T10:40:35] <devMonkey87> I did some  port mapping within configuration mode in Virtualbox with no successful results

1 [2018-10-08T13:49:13] <dragonpiper> Anyone know the reason for extremely slow network connection on mac ? i get 25KB/s on a 1Gbps network when downloading from the internet.  Jenkin's repository for example
2 [2018-10-08T23:23:07] <dragonpiper> Hey guys, i'm running jenkins in a container i have it up and running and conneted to a repo but when i try to do a build it says the label docker doesn't exist
3 [2018-10-08T23:23:33] <dragonpiper> Am i not able to run a docker job on jenkins master ?
4 [2018-10-08T23:23:47] <mateothegreat> “what” says the “label docker” doesn’t exist?
5 [2018-10-08T23:24:22] <dragonpiper> Jenkins in the console  output
6 [2018-10-08T23:25:55] <dragonpiper>  [<-CODE->]
7 [2018-10-08T23:25:57] <dragonpiper> to be exact
8 [2018-10-08T23:26:56] <dragonpiper> My jenkins file is [<-CODE->]
9 [2018-10-08T23:27:22] <dragonpiper> i added it thinking that would  help. I get the same error
10 [2018-10-08T23:28:30] <dragonpiper> I know thatnodespecifies the build agent as node,  but doesn't the docker label tell it to run the pipeline in docker ?
11 [2018-10-08T23:32:07] <dragonpiper> Yea , i've seen that syntax as well, buts it's confusing. What does it change in the execution ?
12 [2018-10-08T23:32:39] <dragonpiper> Is what i have before older syntax ?
13 [2018-10-09T00:04:18] <dragonpiper> Right, but does jenkins execute differently from what i previously had minus thedockerlabel ?
14 [2018-10-09T00:06:29] <dragonpiper> Jenkins says [<-CODE->]
15 [2018-10-09T00:15:29] <dragonpiper> And if i specify an agent i get the docker label error again
16 [2018-10-09T00:15:43] <dragonpiper> The docks says label is required for node build agent

1 [2018-10-09T07:18:20] <darrenstarr> I've just visited [<-LINK->] which says that the docker powershell client is deprecated. It recommends that I use the docker cli or Docker.DotNet directly. I'd prefer to use Docker.DotNet as it would vastly simplify parsing command output. Does anyone have an example of doing this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-10T06:30:11] <hsowan> hello everyone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-10T09:44:45] <yashpl> matrixbot: yeah , there are few rumours and theories that NSA along with syrian govt. did try to backdoor docker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-10T10:38:18] <darrenstarr> I'm pretty sure that it would be hardly a challenge to get a backdoor into the docker ecosystem. Security people always focus on hacking the wrong things. For example, if you want to hack a firewall, don't have the secure code, go after things like the device drivers. VMXNET3 is a great place to start, Cisco's VIC network adapters are good too... those two code bases look like they were written by gorillas bashing keys until it did something. If you want to go after Docker, attack Portainer or something similar... or basically anything which requires access to docker.sock which is commonly used. Docker could be secure as a fortress but hijaaking Flannel or Weave would be a golden ticket. Attacking Weave would probably buy you 100 different ways to hack the network as well. I've noticed that hacking Resin.io might be pretty straight forward these days thanks to aufs. I don't use these tools because they're secure... that would be hopeless.
2 [2018-10-10T10:43:28] <darrenstarr> My personal opinion (not that it matters) is that what makes Linux a security disaster is that once a company starts shipping kernel modules as part of the kernel, it overcomplicates the crap out of auditing the kernel. It also means that no one ever upgrades their drivers because it would be pointless to upgrade a linux driver which is already included in Linux. I wrote a Cisco CDP module for Linux a few months back and the state of the kernel network stack is total shambles these days. sk_buff has become such a massive disgusting example of all that's wrong with the kernel that you should never ever trust Linux for security... and no... I'm not suggesting there's something better... I'm not comparing. It's just that the kernel as it is now is a mess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-11T01:49:31] <dragonpiper> rcjsuen: I figured it out. Docker inside mounts /var/jenkins_home and overrides the working directory to that so what I was seeing wasnt the directory that was built inside the container .
2 [2018-10-11T01:49:46] <dragonpiper> Wish the Jenkins docs were more detailed :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-11T01:51:13] <scott_sword_twitter> is there any way to start a container that isn't running some sort of process like a server and just use it as a dev sandbox?
2 [2018-10-11T02:10:48] <scott_sword_twitter> I ended up using -dit which provides a pseudo tty rather than manually creating a random process [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-10-17T15:16:09] <lisacopeland> can anyone help with docker  for windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T15:16:56] <drumbeg> lisacopeland: Am using Docker on a Windows VM. What's up?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T15:19:45] <lisacopeland> I have been hired to help out on an angularJS project which runs on docker. I think the other devs are using macs. I am running a make file to run the build - it gets to the step 'RUN npm install' and then seems to hang - I don't see any output from NPM at all
2 [2018-10-17T15:20:36] <lisacopeland> drumbeg: It then exits after a few minutes with  encountered an error during CreateProcess: failure in a Windows system call: The compute system exited unexpectedly. (0xc0370106)
3 [2018-10-17T15:21:04] <drumbeg> By "make file" do you mean Dockerfile?
4 [2018-10-17T15:22:02] <lisacopeland> There is a makefile which runs the 'docker build' command and then the 'docker run' command
5 [2018-10-17T15:22:59] <lisacopeland> It looks like it does it in the dockerfile
6 [2018-10-17T15:23:25] <lisacopeland> it starts with 'FROM node:10.5.0'
7 [2018-10-17T15:24:13] <lisacopeland> yeah I gathered that - I am not sure why they are using that version
8 [2018-10-17T15:25:08] <lisacopeland> no - I was just curious about it
9 [2018-10-17T15:25:51] <lisacopeland> Maybe I'll try a different one - any suggestions?
10 [2018-10-17T15:26:45] <lisacopeland> I guess the reason I was wondering about it is that I am running 10.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T15:22:08] <joshuaalm> lisacopeland: Does the Dockerfile specify to install the node and npm packages prior to that step?
2 [2018-10-17T15:23:42] <joshuaalm> OK, so it's using the node docker image as a base
3 [2018-10-17T15:25:03] <joshuaalm> That is certainly an unstable build.  Maybe verify with the team building the app that they're testing on that.
4 [2018-10-17T15:25:50] <rcjsuen> joshuaalm: Oh, hm, it's unstable?
5 [2018-10-17T15:26:02] <rcjsuen> or you mean it's not LTS yet?
6 [2018-10-17T15:27:10] <joshuaalm> I do of course mean that because it's recent - not LTS - it may be  unstable.  Of course, if the devs are using the features in a more recent version, that's up to them to decide.
7 [2018-10-17T15:27:41] <joshuaalm> And if you're using 10.4.1 on your system, Lisa, then it stands to reason they are.
8 [2018-10-17T15:29:54] <lisacopeland> joshuaalm: I just started with this team - I don't know what they are running for node - I am going to reach out about this
9 [2018-10-17T15:32:51] <lisacopeland> rcjsuen: Thanks - I'll try that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T15:24:47] <rcjsuen> lisacopeland: Is there something with 10.5.0 that concerns you?
2 [2018-10-17T15:32:28] <rcjsuen> lisacopeland: Perhaps you can also trynpm install --verbosefor more output maybe?
3 [2018-10-17T15:33:57] <rcjsuen> lisacopeland: I don't know how complicated the build is. But if we assume a basicpackage.json, then you can always try doingnpm installon your own computer instead of through the Docker image. Does that work?
4 [2018-10-17T15:35:04] <lisacopeland> rcjsuen: Yep - that is no problem -  I regularly do npm install, but the version I am using is 10.4.1
5 [2018-10-17T15:37:57] <rcjsuen> I suppose you can also change toFROM node:10.4.1if you feel that's an issue
6 [2018-10-17T15:39:55] <lisacopeland> Looks like the -v switch didn't make a difference - looks like it is hanging and then it errored out the same way
7 [2018-10-17T15:40:56] <rcjsuen> That's too bad.
8 [2018-10-17T15:41:17] <rcjsuen> There are no log output files?
9 [2018-10-17T15:43:55] <rcjsuen> I would suggest removing everything from and including yourRUN npm installthen changing it to start a shell instead, then start that container and from the shell runnpm install --verbosemanually and see what happens out of the shell and for any debug/log output files from Node.js
10 [2018-10-17T15:45:37] <lisacopeland> rcjsuen: Ooh -  good idea - I am going to try that. I did just download a sample dockerized angular app  and it starts with FROM node:9-alpine as builder and it seemed to run npm just fine
11 [2018-10-17T15:53:06] <rcjsuen> I would consider Node 9.x series even more unstable than the Node v10 series
12 [2018-10-17T15:53:25] <rcjsuen> But irregardless, it's good that a sample Dockerfile you found online ran
13 [2018-10-17T15:53:31] <rcjsuen> If that didn't run you have other problems probably ;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T15:29:27] <drumbeg> My team have had issues with Node v10 and some of the node modules we use, so I would concur.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-17T16:16:01] <mateothegreat> lisacopeland: is your container able to reach [<-LINK->] ?
2 [2018-10-18T01:00:25] <mateothegreat> lisacopeland: see it? have you built your image yet?
3 [2018-10-18T01:06:29] <mateothegreat> lisacopeland:  [<-LINK->] might help ya out
4 [2018-10-18T02:37:46] <mateothegreat> lisacopeland: most likely your dist dir isn’t in the right place, i.e.: no index.html so it’s 403
5 [2018-10-18T02:38:36] <mateothegreat> get the container name (docker ps)
6 [2018-10-18T02:38:45] <mateothegreat> thendocker exec -it <container name> sh
7 [2018-10-18T02:38:54] <mateothegreat> that’ll drop you into a shell inside of the running container
8 [2018-10-18T02:39:06] <lisacopeland> ok - thanks I'll try that
9 [2018-10-18T02:40:15] <lisacopeland> So I am following the tutorial at [<-LINK->]

15 [2018-10-18T02:44:22] <lisacopeland> brendonco: It looks like your tutorial is for the mac - I am on windows - are there any differences that I should be aware of?
16 [2018-10-18T02:45:06] <mateothegreat> brendonco: should show the user how to use a nginx web server and build distribution rather than depending onnpm start.. but good work
17 [2018-10-18T02:45:22] <mateothegreat> and maybe add-fto thedocker logs ..command :P

1 [2018-10-17T21:25:16] <hillct> Good evening. Can someone clarify for me whether or not the docker official (repo) mydqld container is meant to bind to the container IP by default? The mysql.cnf appears to suggest it listens only to the local unix socket, not port 3306, unless an external mysql.cnf is used. Is this accurate?

10 [2018-10-23T07:21:32] <prashanth-sams> sure; will do that... I just pass the location in bashrc

2 [2018-10-23T09:32:20] <rcjsuen> I guess the stdout/stderr output is lost
3 [2018-10-23T09:36:05] <katsar0v> In order to see the output in docker logs,cron -fshould output stuff in stderr/stdout. This is not the case, I don't know why.

1 [2018-10-23T19:26:16] <dragonpiper> Well the the issue is my build image and my source are in separate repositories. I was just specifying a normal bind mounted volume in my compose file but file i/o is just to slow.  Is the best method to create a named volume copy source then run docker-compose ?
2 [2018-10-23T19:28:51] <dragonpiper> or is there a way to disable syncing on a bind mount

1 [2018-10-26T14:44:55] <thymbahutymba> Hi, someone have some guide that explain how to develop some app POSIX on windows using docker?I want use docker for develop (with clion) build and test my project with a linux container, in this way i can use something like pthread.I already have docker image but i don't know which are the steps that i have to follow for develop project and then build it on docker container.
2 [2018-10-26T14:53:26] <thymbahutymba> rcjsuen: i don't know which are the process that i have to follow for deploy and build it
3 [2018-10-26T15:27:36] <thymbahutymba> The beaviour that i wish is something like this: develop with clion that compile the code in docker container and then run the binary on it.
4 [2018-10-26T15:31:21] <thymbahutymba> mateothegreat: to the start? I've still created the linux image with develop tool, then what i have to do? Before start it's possible doing something like this?
5 [2018-10-26T15:49:35] <thymbahutymba> mateothegreat: of course but what is the steps that i have to follow to develop my code on docker and then test it?
6 [2018-10-26T15:50:00] <mateothegreat> youCOPY . /appyour code into the docker image
7 [2018-10-26T15:50:32] <mateothegreat> follow this example: [<-LINK->]
8 [2018-10-27T08:21:31] <thymbahutymba> mateothegreat: so each time i change the code i have to make image again for copy all source into docker image, then i can run it and test my app?
9 [2018-10-27T08:22:13] <mateothegreat> thymbahutymba: correctamundo
10 [2018-10-27T08:24:20] <mateothegreat> So think of a “build” (docker build ..) as a means to affect the desired state expressed in yourDockerfile.
11 [2018-10-27T08:24:58] <mateothegreat> It should be assumed that a build will succeed, or retry until successful, and will achieve your desired state.
12 [2018-10-27T08:25:30] <mateothegreat> Therefore rendering an image that is deployment ready, without dependencies.
13 [2018-10-27T08:27:10] <mateothegreat> Another by-product of running your builds (and tests!) in a docker image is that you get a pristine environment where your tests cannot be negatively influenced by environment variables like your local version of globally installed packages.
14 [2018-10-27T08:29:13] <thymbahutymba> so every time i have to build and then run the container. I thought that i have just to run because the image was still created
15 [2018-10-27T08:29:49] <mateothegreat> I don’t understand the question :/
16 [2018-10-27T08:30:21] <mateothegreat> Are you saying you build your image and then youdocker runthe new image to execute your tests?
17 [2018-10-29T07:01:55] <mateothegreat> qait-tarundwivedi: aDockerfileis just a plain text file
18 [2018-10-29T07:13:27] <mateothegreat> You can find an exampleDockerfileand commands on how to build it at [<-LINK->]

1 [2018-10-26T15:29:51] <mateothegreat> thymbahutymba: so where are you stuck exactly?
2 [2018-10-26T15:45:00] <mateothegreat> after youdocker build.. you typicallydocker runyour image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-26T15:56:56] <scottdillon_gitlab> Reading the docker tutorial would help too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-27T10:01:43] <qait-tarundwivedi> I have tried but finding error :unable to prepare context: unable to evaluate symlinks in Dockerfile path: GetFileAttributesEx C:\\Users\\tarundwivedi\\Dockerfile: The system cannot find the filespecified.
2 [2018-10-27T10:01:43] <qait-tarundwivedi> Hey how i will create Dockerfile in Window OS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-28T01:48:33] <c0ze> @mateothegreat so each time i change the code i have to make image again for copy all source into docker image, then i can run it and test my app?Essentially yes. But docker is smart enough to cache build steps in your previous builds. Every line in your dockerfile corresponds to an image layer. If you don't change your line, previously generated layer will be used. Therefore, if you don't change your deps, only the lines after your COPY command should be run, others will be used from layer cache.You can find more about docker layers herehttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31222377/what-are-docker-image-layers

1 [2018-10-29T11:49:13] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> combo Consul for Service Discovery and distributed KV store, Ocelot for Gateway load balancing, Identity Server 4 for authentication and RabbitMQ as a Service Bus hosted on premises in a private network running Docker Containers orchestrated with Kubernetes. How realistic is this? I am especially referring to the docker integration, are there any issues I should be aware of? What you guys think? I can see IS4 and Ocelot have nice integrations with Consul but I am not sure if I will not run into accessability problems inside of the containers. I would be running a set of .NET Core 2.1 Services inside the containers. Anyone tried a similar setup?
2 [2018-10-31T08:57:23] <larsdesigns> phiterf: The good news is that docker-compose automatically makes a docker network for you.
3 [2018-10-31T08:57:44] <larsdesigns> So there is no need to us the the depreciated —link option.
4 [2018-10-31T08:58:50] <larsdesigns> It is optional to define your own user-defined network within the docker-compose file but usually not nessesary if the default works.
5 [2018-10-31T08:59:26] <larsdesigns> By default the container name is the host name and all the containers within the docker-compose file can access each other using that name.
6 [2018-10-31T09:00:20] <larsdesigns> phiterf: I hope that helps.

3 [2018-10-31T10:13:29] <katsar0v> I have a wp system that has a folder insidewp-content. This folder is a docker volume, which is also mounted in an ssh container, so users can upload stuff with WinSCP
4 [2018-10-31T10:13:47] <katsar0v> I dont want users to access the host machine, they just access the isolated docker container with sftp / ssh
5 [2018-10-31T10:14:39] <larsdesigns> Okay, then looks like you should debug the handshake using ssh -v.
6 [2018-10-31T10:15:00] <larsdesigns> The output should show you where the authentication process is failing.

8 [2018-10-31T10:16:01] <katsar0v> and in ssh only one user is allowed. Problem is that only one machine can be logged at the same time for this user

26 [2018-10-31T10:30:23] <larsdesigns> I do not think it is related but you will want to make sure to expose the port in the DockerFile.
27 [2018-10-31T10:31:37] <larsdesigns> if not exposed in the build, then I have found unpredictable behaviour for port connections depending on the docker version.
28 [2018-10-31T10:32:59] <katsar0v> just tried - https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/running_ssh_service/it works with multiple logins

31 [2018-10-31T11:37:58] <katsar0v> the node image should have default CMD in case you deleted yours
32 [2018-10-31T11:39:00] <katsar0v> cmd in dockerfile and docker compose is different I see
33 [2018-10-31T11:45:02] <SalathielGenese> @katsar0v , [<-CODE->]
34 [2018-10-31T11:55:52] <SalathielGenese> The DevOps I work with just got up and found it - [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Thanks unto you guys, @rcjsuen , @katsar0v !
35 [2018-10-31T11:58:30] <SalathielGenese> So the fix is to add environment in docker-compose.yaml [<-CODE->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-31T10:10:49] <larsdesigns> katsar0v: , it is usally discouraged to run ssh within a container. Because the containers are availble using docker exec. However, you can debug the authentication using ssh -v and examining the output.
2 [2018-10-31T10:11:37] <larsdesigns> Can I ask why you would opt to use ssh?

1 [2018-10-31T11:01:34] <SalathielGenese> Hi folks,I've been overriding CMD in docker-compose to run with nodemon and other dev stuff, but to test graceful shutdown, I removed the CMD override from docker-compose.yaml file and my container isn't output to terminal. I tried : [<-CODE->] Here is my Dockerfile [<-CODE->] Here's an except from docker-compose.yaml [<-CODE->] And finally, an excerpt from package.json [<-CODE->]
2 [2018-10-31T11:04:47] <SalathielGenese> My problem is to havemy container output to terminalwhen Idocker-compose up --build
3 [2018-10-31T11:05:06] <SalathielGenese> Thanks beforehand !
4 [2018-10-31T11:13:00] <SalathielGenese> PS: Yes, I ran it withdocker run- Same misbehavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-31T11:52:11] <rcjsuen> Did you try running in detached mode with-dthen?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-31T12:02:15] <katsar0v> you meanDEBUGenv variable for the container? (because there is log level for docker which is a separate thing). Just to clarify this
2 [2018-10-31T12:03:20] <SalathielGenese> Yes, for the container -The other services were just running fine (redis, pubsub emulator, etc...)
3 [2018-10-31T12:03:35] <katsar0v>   glad you solved this
4 [2018-10-31T12:03:42] <SalathielGenese> running fine and logging just fine -
5 [2018-10-31T12:07:36] <SalathielGenese> Thanks for your endeavor

1 [2018-10-31T12:51:17] <katsar0v> Hello, has somebody made benchmarks with HDD I/O on volumes mounted at the same time on different containers vs. I/O on host HDD?
2 [2018-10-31T12:51:32] <katsar0v> I think performance might be a bit lower on mounted volumes with docker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-10-31T21:59:08] <sabrehagen> Hi, I'm having trouble with mounts. I want to have adocker-composecontainer which starts mydocker-compose.yamlfile. I'm usingdocker run --rm  --mount type=bind,source=$HOME,target=/root,bind-propagation=shared wernight/docker-composebut when my containers in mydocker-compose.yamlfile are started, the mounted directories contain no files
2 [2018-10-31T21:59:34] <sabrehagen> volume mounts:host -> docker-compose -> compose-stack-container
3 [2018-10-31T22:00:14] <sabrehagen> Fromhost -> docker-composethe mount works, but fromdocker-compose -> compose-stack-containerit doesn't

5 [2018-11-01T01:18:15] <sabrehagen> The first question I need clarified is: Is it possible to create anewcontainer with a mounted volume fromwithina container with that volume mounted.

1 [2018-11-01T09:06:43] <vella-nicholas> I am using Docker on Windows and when I boot up my laptop, Docker starts but mu MongoDb instance does not work. I have to restart Docker everytime. Is this a known issue or am I doing osmething wrong?
2 [2018-11-01T09:26:23] <vella-nicholas> yes
3 [2018-11-01T09:33:55] <vella-nicholas> it should start automatically no? Or did I miss some setup config?
4 [2018-11-01T10:25:14] <vella-nicholas> thank you, I will have a look
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-01T09:21:50] <mateothegreat> nvella88: do you mean your mongo container does not automatically start?
2 [2018-11-01T10:02:37] <mateothegreat> you need to use—restart=alwaysif you useddocker run ..
3 [2018-11-01T10:02:56] <mateothegreat> if you used docker-compose you will need to use [<-CODE->]
4 [2018-11-01T12:35:46] <mateothegreat> sabrehagen: why not use use-v $HOME:/root?
5 [2018-11-01T12:36:08] <mateothegreat> also, I don’t think overwriting /root is a good idea
6 [2018-11-01T12:36:32] <sabrehagen> True, but this is just a dev environment
7 [2018-11-01T12:36:57] <sabrehagen> What would your volume recommendation achieve? I'm not understanding it
8 [2018-11-01T12:37:40] <mateothegreat> what are you trying to accomplish?
9 [2018-11-01T12:37:59] <mateothegreat> I took that from your post, "I\'m using docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=$HOME,target=/root,bind-propagation=shared "
10 [2018-11-02T00:59:14] <sabrehagen> mateothegreat: The full--mountargument rather than-vis so I can set thebind-propagationargument. I found my aforementioned 'empty mounts' when I used-v.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-01T12:17:36] <sabrehagen> mateothegreat: Do you have any idea about my issue above?

1 [2018-11-01T23:27:28] <AlexITC> Hi, is there a simple guide on how to use the docker REST API while working on windows?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-02T11:21:32] <iosven> hi, I am hoping to get some hints here, we have a plain vanilla setup with a dockerized nginx acting as http Reverse Proxy and a dockerized microservice with a http REST API behind it... usually when we restart the microservice (we do that withdocker-compose downanddocker-compose up -d) we also need to restart the nginx, otherwise it will tell the outside world that our URL path is HTTP Status 502 Bad Gateway. Any hints to that?  Does nginx somehow cache aspects of TCP connections it uses to forward requests, or can this be a Docker-specific problem/behavior?
2 [2018-11-02T13:36:41] <iosven> adaliszk: thanks, having a look
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-02T11:33:05] <adaliszk> try out [<-LINK->]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-02T12:28:18] <adaliszk> or have a look at how jwilder and the contributors solve the same issue
2 [2018-11-02T12:28:20] <adaliszk> :P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-02T13:37:27] <adaliszk> what that image does it listens to docker events and automatically updates and creates reverse proxy on the network where it's deployed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-04T05:53:36] <royswastik> If I dockerize my existing application with single node and two replicas, how do I maintain persistent user session in those two replicas?
2 [2018-11-04T05:53:52] <royswastik> I have looked at sticky session on docker docs ( [<-LINK->] ) . But, do I have to setup this everytime I dockerize an application which maintains user session?
3 [2018-11-04T06:25:51] <mateothegreat> royswastik: usually you have a reverse proxy like haproxy or nginx in front
4 [2018-11-04T07:15:49] <mateothegreat> most session data is stored on the filesystem by default .. so pinning a user to a specific node it the only logical choice otherwise you’re rolling redis/memcache/etc as a session store
5 [2018-11-04T18:33:58] <royswastik> mateothegreat: That was helpful. I am exploring on how to pin the user to specific nodes.
6 [2018-11-05T00:55:03] <royswastik> @‘a
7 [2018-11-05T00:55:57] <royswastik> @mateothegreat can you give a little explanation on why reverse proxy will solve the session problem?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-04T06:49:43] <ramireles> Isn’t a user session and Authentication gonna be dependent on the backend framework?

1 [2018-11-04T15:27:06] <sebastjan-hribar> Hi all, I have a more high level docker question. I currently have one dockerized app running on a custom server with dedicated DB container. This was more or less my learning project and a POC of the app. Now I'd like to scale and I'd advice where to look for further learning material and best practices how to do this with docker. I imagine it would be best to have the same APP/DB container par for each new customer. Am I right?

7 [2018-11-06T03:13:46] <DavidMoura07> nops, I have to export this locally first?
8 [2018-11-06T03:56:47] <mateothegreat> fahman: shouldn’t need to .. do you happen to have a file named.envin your directory when building the image? if so, this is overriding your env vars

1 [2018-11-06T20:52:46] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> Considering the network in compose is closed and managed internally by the docker daemon, is there any point of running https inside of the individual microservices in the containers? I am not talking frontend app which is obviously ssl to protect from user->browser request hijacking, just the backend services. I see quite alot of people running port 80 on compose

1 [2018-11-07T15:15:57] <dragonpiper> Can you use multipleFROMto combine full images  ?
2 [2018-11-07T15:16:25] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> yes@dragonpiperbut you need to copy and use intermediary containers
3 [2018-11-07T15:18:33] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> when declaring the initial image use "AS" so "FROM node:alpine AS first_image"
4 [2018-11-07T15:19:48] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> and then after declaration of the second image tell it to use that alias like so: "COPY --from=first_image /app/dir /app/dir

2 [2018-11-07T15:25:40] <dragonpiper> So if the base image apk installs some programs, and make certain directories. I have to know where all the artifacts are of all those processes and manually specify a copy from path ?
3 [2018-11-07T15:28:24] <dragonpiper> piotr-mamenas:
4 [2018-11-07T15:29:24] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> you don't, you specify the path yourself by using the workspace@dragonpiper, if they come pre-installed in the image then yes you have to know the path like usr/share/nginx/html for the distribution folder of nginx
5 [2018-11-07T15:29:32] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> dragonpiper:
6 [2018-11-07T15:30:40] <dragonpiper> What about environmental variables the base image creates ?
7 [2018-11-07T15:32:04] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> what do you mean by environmental variables?\\
8 [2018-11-07T15:32:58] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> you mean the %PATH% variables to run from console in windows or something else?
9 [2018-11-07T15:33:50] <dragonpiper> Yea that as well and env  vairbales the base image exports . ex [<-CODE->]
10 [2018-11-07T15:39:30] <ghost~5bc98094d73408ce4fabf741> that I don't know. You need  to google, but you should be able to set them the same way from the same file though

2 [2018-11-07T18:21:12] <JoshECarmoji> I have a few questions
3 [2018-11-07T18:21:40] <JoshECarmoji> I'm trying to set up a wordpress stack (Wordpress, mySQL, NGINX)
4 [2018-11-07T18:22:29] <JoshECarmoji> I'm wondering if I can define everything in one docker-compose.yml and deploy each service to their own server using docker hub
5 [2018-11-07T18:23:51] <rcjsuen> I\'m not sure I understand what you mean by "deploy each service to their own server using docker hub"
6 [2018-11-07T18:24:07] <rcjsuen> You push Docker images to Docker Hub. You don't deploy live services to Docker Hub.
7 [2018-11-07T18:24:45] <JoshECarmoji> Another question is how can I combine Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so that I can set up each of my containers before deploying
8 [2018-11-07T18:25:19] <JoshECarmoji> Docker Hub deploys your image to a cloud server no?
9 [2018-11-07T18:25:42] <rcjsuen> Think of Docker Hub as something like a Dropbox
10 [2018-11-07T18:25:50] <rcjsuen> It stores images for other people to download
11 [2018-11-07T18:25:57] <JoshECarmoji> Maybe I'm thinking of docker cloud then
12 [2018-11-07T18:26:31] <rcjsuen> Possibly. I have never used Docker Cloud so I can't comment there.
13 [2018-11-07T18:26:47] <JoshECarmoji> Ok what about my second question?
14 [2018-11-07T18:27:31] <JoshECarmoji> Thanks for the help by the way
15 [2018-11-07T18:27:51] <rcjsuen> For your second question, it sounds like you should read some tutorials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-07T18:14:46] <rcjsuen> Better to just ask the question

1 [2018-11-09T18:04:54] <jmunson> I just cloned a disk that contained /var/lib/docker and attached it to another VM. I'm trying to have it join the same docker swarm that the node i copied it from is in, but it seems like there is some kind of id number that came with it, so when I bring up the new node it takes the same slot as the old worker..  does anyone know what I need to do to re-generate whatever id its using there?
2 [2018-11-09T18:06:42] <jmunson> argeas: I thinkdocker history $IMAGENAMEis what you want
3 [2018-11-09T19:21:02] <jmunson> also nevermind, I fixed my issue by just re-installing docker without the volume mounted, and copying over everything it created on to the pre-existing volume
4 [2018-11-09T19:21:40] <jmunson> now I'm just struggling with trying to figure out why docker keeps shutting down my services and bringing new ones up despite no failing healthchecks or any indication of why it is doing it
5 [2018-11-09T19:23:32] <jmunson> I wish there was some kind ofdocker swarm statusthat could tell me what its trying to do and why. looking at the logs of the individual services doesn't tell me anything, they all seem fine up to the point that docker kills the service and tries to start another one
6 [2018-11-09T19:25:06] <jmunson> nor is there any indication why there are 12 replicas running of a service that is scaled to 8 replicas..  or why it would then complain about not enough resources when, you know, its wasting them all on replicas that it was never told to launch

I've reading articles here and there since Friday and constantly find new words, new approaches, and it is turning too much.What I Succeeded until nowUse custom key/cert to start my http2 serverWhat I need help forUse the key (or maybe cert - not sure which one) to query the server container.Some factsnode:carbon-alpineThanks in advance

1 [2018-11-12T21:35:18] <JoshECarmoji> How do you publish an image that was built in docker-compose
2 [2018-11-12T21:36:37] <JoshECarmoji> Im trying to deploy a swarm and it can't download the containers from the public repo because they're not tagged and uploaded I guess

1 [2018-11-13T17:14:09] <briancaffey> Quick question. I have 2,000 Excel files that I need to access from one of my containers. I'll put them inside of a folder calledbackend/datathat is used to build my REST API service using Django. In my Dockerfile i doADD . /code/, which would add all of the files to the image, which I don't want. Should I put a.dockerignorefile in the data folder and ignore everything in the folder? I would then do- ./backend/data:/code/backend/datain my docker compose file. Does this make sense? Is there a better way?
2 [2018-11-13T17:27:03] <briancaffey> yes@SalathielGenese
3 [2018-11-13T17:29:32] <briancaffey> OK, that's what I'm thinking. I'm just not sure what will be sent to the docker daemon in compose when specifying a volume.
4 [2018-11-13T17:30:14] <briancaffey> OK, yes that's what I have in my docker compose file. So this will not send./backend/datato the docker daemon, is that correct?@SalathielGenese
5 [2018-11-13T17:31:15] <SalathielGenese> The general practice for Dockerfile is to copy only mandatory file you have -Everything else is customized and thus, provided when the container starts
6 [2018-11-13T17:33:43] <briancaffey> Right, but I have lots of data files that are nested inside of a mandatory folder. In this case I would think using a.dockerignorefile would be appropriate. I'm wondering if the.dockerignorefile would interfere with folders I'm trying to mount in a volume. I guess I should try it out
7 [2018-11-13T17:47:57] <SalathielGenese> When I said mandatory, I specifically meant anything the image consumer cannot provide at runtime.
8 [2018-11-13T17:48:01] <SalathielGenese> But...
9 [2018-11-13T17:53:30] <SalathielGenese> Let's say you have [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]
10 [2018-11-13T17:53:37] <briancaffey> OK,
11 [2018-11-13T17:55:31] <SalathielGenese> Still in docker-compose.yaml [<-CODE->]
12 [2018-11-13T17:56:55] <briancaffey> OK, interesting. I have seen this pattern in other places. I'll try it. Thank you for your advice
13 [2018-11-13T17:57:00] <SalathielGenese> This way you\'re turning/code/b/and/code/c"persistent", i.e available only within the container
14 [2018-11-13T17:58:05] <SalathielGenese> Dockercompose will actually create an empty folder in that container
15 [2018-11-13T17:58:45] <SalathielGenese> And your HOST inodes./band./cwill be excluded from mounting
16 [2018-11-13T17:59:42] <briancaffey> So the order does matter when specifying volumes in compose?
17 [2018-11-13T18:01:09] <rcjsuen> No
18 [2018-11-13T18:01:26] <rcjsuen> or wait, I misread your question
19 [2018-11-13T18:03:01] <SalathielGenese> briancaffey: - The order matters - peristent folders first
20 [2018-11-13T18:03:13] <briancaffey> OK, thanks for clarifying
21 [2018-11-13T18:04:22] <SalathielGenese> As you may have noticed, unlike other volume definition,${ host_path }:${ container_path }, persistent folders are just${ container_path }
22 [2018-11-13T18:05:20] <SalathielGenese> and when I say the order matters, I just meanthe persistent endpoint MUST be defined BEFORE the volume that may use that path
23 [2018-11-13T18:05:26] <briancaffey> Right, that has been confusing for me, but I think I see how it works when there is only one "term" in the volume declaration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-13T17:26:25] <SalathielGenese> Do you start you containers with compose ? (docker-compose)
2 [2018-11-13T17:27:37] <SalathielGenese> Then, you may not need to do it from Dockerfile
3 [2018-11-13T17:28:05] <SalathielGenese> In your dokcer-compose.yaml file, mount it as volume

1 [2018-11-15T22:42:06] <3lpsy_twitter> Greetings. Is there an easy way to allow inbound connections to docker container but block outbound connections?
2 [2018-11-15T22:42:15] <3lpsy_twitter> I'm using docker-compose. For the webapp, I used a proxy container that has two interfaces, one for a public docker bridge network, the other for an internal docker bridge network. But I don't want to the same for the other network services.
3 [2018-11-15T22:43:35] <3lpsy_twitter> I could setup a squid proxy container in the same fashion, but I was hoping their was an easier way. I tried setting iptables rules on the host, but docker doesn't respect host rules unless you use a host adapter (i think?). And I do not want to use a host adapter.

1 [2018-11-28T19:30:20] <marcguilera> is docker a good thing to set up a dev environment? i use dart and java mainly and it would be nice to be able to have some dockerfiles to run and get a consistent devenv everywhere. is docker good for this? (newebe)
2 [2018-11-29T15:39:54] <marcguilera> davidmichaelkarr: any good tutorials? i know there are a ton out there but..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-11-28T20:22:41] <davidmichaelkarr> marcguilera: yes, this is a common strategy. docker is used for much more than production environments.
2 [2018-12-03T02:41:16] <davidmichaelkarr> royswastik: it really depends on what the db is used for. if the db contents need to be preserved, then it's likely.

2 [2018-11-30T16:12:20] <dragonpiper> If i want to change the command of a container started from docker-compose, do i have to do a down and up ?

1 [2018-11-29T21:10:12] <revisualize> Greetings friends, I need a good bit of help. I recently had a recruiter reach out to me about an amazing opportunity with a company here in Seattle. The staffing agency recruiter is asking me to come up with a project to showcase some "DevOps" tools knowledge by the weekend. However, I\'m a bit stuck. I\'ve been a traditional mid-sr Network Systems Administrator working mostly on in-house IT projects and doing a bit of automation. (It\'s sad because working on in-house IT projects automation isn\'t always pushed for one-off projects or issues.) Because I\'ve worked in Windows server environments, I\'ve used quite a bit of PowerShell. I also have a good bit of Linux knowledge and I could easily be a jr-mid Linux systems admin in a more Windows environment. (And I feel that\'s what they\'re looking for.)However, this staffing agency recruiter really wants to submit my resume with a simple example project to showcase with my application.I\'m stuck as to what to do here and how to showcase myself with a project to push my application forward.The job description states that they\'d like someone with a familiarity using automated deployment tools such as Jenkins, Chef, Ansible, or equivalent and scripting knowledge with PowerShell or Python and of course Docker knowledge.I have the PowerShell experience. I\'ve worked through the Microsoft Virtual Academy courses on PowerShell. I\'ve even written several scripts and automated several processes with PowerShell. I can easily talk about my PoSh projects.I\'m hoping to get a good project put together that I can use to showcase a basic familiarity with this whole \'DevOps\' toolchain. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated.

1 [2018-11-30T03:37:06] <btrepp> is there a way to configure docker pull to ignore certificate errors?
2 [2018-11-30T03:37:46] <btrepp> all the environment variables talk about turning TLS on, it seems to already be on. I would like to disable the TLS verification in my dev/test/vm environment

1 [2018-12-03T02:24:36] <royswastik> Hi,  is it normal to use a mounted volume for MySQL database in production?
2 [2018-12-03T02:47:41] <royswastik> davidmichaelkarr: ...the DB content needs to be preserved. My concern is mainly because I see people saying not to use 'volumes' in production. Not sure if this is true or if it makes the application slower.
3 [2018-12-03T02:49:46] <davidmichaelkarr> royswastik: no idea what is meant by that.
4 [2018-12-03T02:51:30] <royswastik> Thanks. I think I got the answer. I will probably use volumes to persist the data.
5 [2018-12-03T02:55:31] <royswastik> I had just one more quick question. I am using a private container registry from a cloud provider, and I do not want to push the production image containing DB credentials to the registry. What is the standard way to pass the credentials to the production image?Is it using environment variables passed through docker-compose file and access env vars from application,or, using docker-entrypoint.sh to set those files with credentials inside the container?I am sorry if it's a noob question.

1 [2018-12-03T12:06:36] <rcjsuen> We use secrets in Kubernetes and then they get injected as environment variables
2 [2018-12-03T16:44:32] <rcjsuen> That's a very open ended question
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-12-03T16:44:21] <gujri> Hi is there any one works with cloud ?
2 [2018-12-03T16:45:07] <gujri> i need any one try this code pattern does it works or not

4 [2018-12-03T16:45:21] <gujri> it seems that it gets me many issues

1 [2018-12-03T17:21:06] <royswastik> Using docker secrets for database.php file in my Codigniter application, which contains DB credentials... Is this a standard thing?
2 [2018-12-03T17:23:46] <royswastik> rcjsuen: Hi, how do you inject a secret as environment variable? One way I can think of is to use docker-entrypoint.sh to read the secret files and set it as environment variable. Although, I would consider having the [<-LINK->] containing the cred safer instead of environment variable.
3 [2018-12-03T17:24:40] <rcjsuen> Well, we use Kubernetes
4 [2018-12-03T17:25:00] <rcjsuen>  [<-LINK->]
5 [2018-12-03T17:25:58] <rcjsuen>  [<-CODE->]
6 [2018-12-03T17:27:50] <royswastik> Oh got it. I am actually using it with swarm. I just got the idea of copying the secret as DB config file to target application folder. But, not sure if that is a standard way or if there is a better/simpler alternative.
7 [2018-12-03T17:32:08] <royswastik> and thanks@rcjsuen

1 [2018-12-03T17:47:28] <RobertKielty> royswastik: Have you checked [<-LINK->] ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-12-03T17:58:58] <royswastik> RobertKielty: Hi Robert,, yes.. I know how to do it.. I was wondering if  that is a standard way of managing db config files
2 [2018-12-03T17:59:34] <royswastik> Or if there are better alternatives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2018-12-03T19:51:23] <royswastik> To make my question simpler, here is an easy explanation -"PHP frameworks like Codigniter read DB credentials from files like database.php", \n"The DB credentials for production can not be stored in container registry or version control", \n"So, there needs to be a way to pass the credential files(like database.php) when a service is started"My question is what is the correct way to do it?
