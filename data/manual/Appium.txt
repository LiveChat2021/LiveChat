16 [2016-12-29 13:42:38] <mgmanikandan87> yes
17 [2016-12-29 13:42:54] <shabinmohan> ok...
18 [2016-12-29 13:43:28] <shabinmohan> instead of scroll I am usig swipe
19 [2016-12-29 13:43:47] <prabudakshan> swiping is the only option available
20 [2016-12-29 13:44:05] <sourcebits-siddesh> hmmm
21 [2016-12-29 13:44:05] <shabinmohan> if any of you know the beter scroll option in latest appium please suggest
22 [2016-12-29 13:44:13] <sourcebits-siddesh> yeah

27 [2016-12-29 13:46:44] <tfcardoso> Do not use driver.swipe. It was deprecated in Java 5.0
28 [2016-12-29 13:46:53] <tfcardoso> use TouchAction class
29 [2016-12-29 14:01:48] <sourcebits-siddesh> tfcardoso: for swipe
30 [2016-12-29 14:01:52] <sourcebits-siddesh> ?\
31 [2016-12-29 14:02:49] <tfcardoso> yes... you can do press().waitaction().moveTo().release().perform() p.e.
32 [2016-12-29 14:03:32] <tfcardoso> I still didn't adapt my code to it, but I'll have to change all the swipe, tap, zoom, pinch, etc. that I have

1 [2017-01-03 13:29:31] <mvanevery> hey everyone, will Appium 1.6.3 work with XCode 7.3.1? Or do I need to upgrade to XCode8?
2 [2017-01-04 00:49:18] <hardik-d> it should
3 [2017-01-04 00:49:39] <mvanevery> awesome. thank you
4 [2017-01-04 00:50:02] <hardik-d> don't use automationName XCUITest
5 [2017-01-04 00:50:09] <hardik-d> in your caps
6 [2017-01-04 00:50:46] <mvanevery> is that only for Xcode 8?
7 [2017-01-04 00:58:11] <hardik-d> yes
8 [2017-01-04 01:03:41] <mvanevery> awesome. I will remember that. thank you

// Part 1: appium and Xcode version
1 [2017-01-17T19:28:52] <propaul> Hi guys, i have appium 1.5.3 installed in my Mac, i had created an iOS simulator for iPhone 5 with version 9.3 using Xcode 7.3.1 and i was able to launch the web app i had put in my script.  When i updated to Xcode 8.2.1 the simulator would not launch nor run script
2 [2017-01-17T19:30:38] <propaul> I also cannot execute any tests using real iOS device, is there certain steps i have to take using the developer id for real iOS device to work?
3 [2017-01-17T19:31:14] <Edge-Man> You cannot use Xcode 8.2.1 with Appium 1.5.3
4 [2017-01-17T19:31:32] <Edge-Man> Xcode 8.0 + replaced the instrumentation with XCtests......
5 [2017-01-17T19:31:37] <hardik-d> upgrade to appium 1.6.3
6 [2017-01-17T19:31:47] <Edge-Man> ^ +++
7 [2017-01-17T19:32:12] <propaul> would i be able to test on my real device using 1.6.3 and Xcode 8.2.1?
8 [2017-01-17T19:32:32] <Edge-Man> yeah, but it's going to take a bit of updating to get there
9 [2017-01-17T19:32:51] <Edge-Man> This video does a good job telling you what to do: [<-LINK->]
10 [2017-01-17T19:33:53] <propaul> is 1.6.3 available on appium.io for Mac?
11 [2017-01-17T19:34:08] <Edge-Man> Yes and no..
12 [2017-01-17T19:34:33] <Edge-Man> as of Appium 1.6.0, there is no .dmg you have to run everything via command line.
13 [2017-01-17T19:35:14] <propaul> what if i used xcdoe 7
14 [2017-01-17T19:35:35] <Edge-Man> Then appium 1.5.3 will work
15 [2017-01-17T19:35:47] <Edge-Man> but you wont be able to target a iOS 10 device
16 [2017-01-17T19:36:14] <propaul> would it support iOS 10.2?
17 [2017-01-17T19:36:45] <Edge-Man> nope.
18 [2017-01-17T19:36:56] <Edge-Man> anything iOS 10 + requires Xcode 8.0 +
19 [2017-01-17T19:37:04] <propaul> once the iOS updates to latest version, is it possible to downgrade?
20 [2017-01-17T19:37:11] <Edge-Man> nope.
21 [2017-01-17T19:37:20] <Edge-Man> Well, I sorta lied.
22 [2017-01-17T19:38:17] <propaul> do i have to setup the certificate and provisioning through apple developer site for all this to work?
23 [2017-01-17T19:38:30] <Edge-Man> You can downgrade, but you have a very short window to do it. Basically, Apple's activation server removes the older iOS version. I cannot remember if it is immediate or it's a few days.
24 [2017-01-17T19:39:27] <Edge-Man> I believe you do need a developer team account to get it all working. I'm not sure. Perhaps someone could answer that for you.
25 [2017-01-17T19:39:32] <propaul> thats fine ill just leave it at 10.2...i enabled the UI automation
26 [2017-01-17T19:40:27] <propaul> yea my company got the dev team id, i just have to figure out a way to make the script run on real device
27 [2017-01-17T19:41:11] <propaul> i have the android real device setup, iOS seems a little more tricky
28 [2017-01-17T19:41:32] <propaul> cool, thnx, ill check it out

1 [2017-01-18T10:03:33] <sanojqa> driver.findelement(by.name() not supporting in the latest appium. Heve any alternative to this?
2 [2017-01-18T10:11:53] <priyankshah217> use accessibility id instead of name
3 [2017-01-18T10:12:13] <sanojqa> how can we write any sample?
4 [2017-01-18T10:12:32] <sanojqa> driver.findelement(by.name("login")).click();
5 [2017-01-18T10:13:31] <priyankshah217> driver.findElementByAccessibilityId("Login").click();
6 [2017-01-18T10:26:33] <coding-yogi> sanojqa: do you see any error if you use name?
7 [2017-01-18T10:26:47] <coding-yogi> or its just that appium doesn't find the required element?
8 [2017-01-18T10:37:35] <coding-yogi> got it
9 [2017-01-18T10:37:46] <coding-yogi> appium now uses UiAutomator2
10 [2017-01-18T10:37:56] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
11 [2017-01-18T10:38:14] <coding-yogi> this seems to be the current code, the one I posted above is the old one
12 [2017-01-18T10:38:23] <coding-yogi> I dnt see any by.Name here
13 [2017-01-18T10:38:34] <coding-yogi> and the error matches what you have mentioned
14 [2017-01-18T10:38:36] <sanojqa> is this work for iOS? 
15[2017-01-18T10:40:21] <coding-yogi> what works for iOS? name?
16 [2017-01-18T10:42:03] <sanojqa> name not working for iOS, actually I got the issue for iOS
17 [2017-01-18T10:44:08] <coding-yogi> I see it for old ios driver [<-LINK->]
18 [2017-01-18T10:44:43] <coding-yogi> but I guess new version uses appium-xcuitest-driver ??
19 [2017-01-18T10:45:16] <sanojqa> am using appium 1.5.3 and locator 'name'
20 [2017-01-18T10:45:26] <sanojqa> its not working
21 [2017-01-18T10:45:57] <coding-yogi> I am not sure what appium 1.5.3 uses, I assume it is using appium-xcuitest-driver
22 [2017-01-18T10:46:05] <coding-yogi> haven't worked on appium for long time
23 [2017-01-18T10:46:30] <sanojqa> aniket-21: ok fine, Thanks for the response
24 [2017-01-18T10:48:06] <coding-yogi> i.6.0 should be using appium-xcuitest-driver as per the changelog [<-LINK->]
25 [2017-01-18T10:48:13] <coding-yogi> 1.6.0*
26 [2017-01-18T10:49:11] <coding-yogi> so ideally Name should work
27 [2017-01-18T10:49:32] <sanojqa> aniket-21: fin
28 [2017-01-18T10:49:33] <sanojqa> e
29 [2017-01-18T10:49:40] <priyankshah217> check java-client library
30 [2017-01-18T10:52:48] <coding-yogi> java-client lob should have it else his code won't compile, right?
31 [2017-01-18T10:53:29] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
32 [2017-01-18T10:53:38] <priyankshah217> (Y)
33 [2017-01-18T10:53:48] <priyankshah217>
34 [2017-01-18T10:58:15] <coding-yogi> sanojqa: , u can try something like findElementByIosUIAutomation("au.getElementByName('somename')")
35 [2017-01-18T10:58:44] <sanojqa> aniket-21: let me try and update you
36 [2017-01-18T10:59:36] <coding-yogi> also it would be good to see appium log when u get the error for name
37 [2017-01-18T10:59:41] <coding-yogi> would be helpful to debug

1 [2016-11-28 10:23:45] <Achini_C_twitter> Hi All, Can someone tell me how can I use UI inspector for iOS in appium 1.6?
2 [2016-11-28 10:24:47] <mgmanikandan87> Achini_C_twitter:  [<-LINK->] 
3 [2016-11-28 10:24:54] <mgmanikandan87>  [<-LINK->] 
4 [2016-11-28 10:33:11] <Achini_C_twitter> mgmanikandan87: Thanks a lot.  Can you let me know one thing clarification? How can I enable the phone to support development in xcode. Due to this I cannot select iPhone via Accessibility inspector?
5 [2016-11-28 10:34:51] <mgmanikandan87> once you connect the device you can launch the inspect though that also you can view the screen
6 [2016-11-28 10:38:18] <Achini_C_twitter> ok. Manu Thanks

2 [2017-01-26T00:57:17] <mkulava> Guys, is it possible to automate application written in Swift 3 using Appium? I've been told that Appium can interact only with objective c apps
3 [2017-01-26T01:11:14] <coding-yogi> I hv automated swift apps ,not sure about swift 3 in specific
4 [2017-01-26T01:15:24] <mkulava> aniket-21: thanks for your answer
5 [2017-01-26T08:55:33] <RatkoD> I think it doesn't matter which language is used to write the app, either way, appium does not require anythin to be implemented in the app so the automation will work, unlike some other frameworks
6 [2017-01-26T08:56:00] <RatkoD> appium uses apple testing framework, now XCUItest
7 [2017-01-26T10:19:10] <mkulava> RatkoD: so it is possible to run tests on iOS 10 and it is compatibel with XCode 8 now?
8 [2017-01-26T10:48:54] <hazmeister> mkulava: it is indeed, with the capability automationName : XCUITest
9 [2017-01-26T10:51:03] <mkulava> hazmeister: great news, thank you
10 [2017-01-26T14:28:39] <RatkoD> yes, just to confirm, but it's a very complicated setup
11 [2017-01-26T14:28:44] <RatkoD> very very complicated
12 [2017-01-26T14:28:46] <RatkoD> very

1 [2016-12-19 11:13:50] <shabinmohan> Hi any one can tell what are the mandatory capabilities for iOS to run on real device?
2 [2016-12-19 11:42:25] <RatkoD> you cannot test iOS app using windows, just on mac
3 [2016-12-19 11:42:43] <RatkoD> you cannot do anything on Win for a iOS app
4 [2016-12-19 11:42:58] <shabinmohan> Exactly !
5 [2016-12-19 11:43:04] <RatkoD> you cannot develop on other then Mac

1 [2016-12-30 18:24:58] <blueice349> anyone know why appium 1.5.3 will not work with my android emulator? It worked prior to 1.5.3
2 [2016-12-31 07:52:32] <shabinmohan> blueice349: app is nnot launching ?
3 [2017-01-02 04:40:27] <blueice349> yes its not I have been trying to firgure out what is wrong
4 [2017-01-02 04:40:32] <blueice349> it works on Android Device

1 [2017-01-30T22:16:54] <propaul> Does anyone know what steps do i have to take to launch a website from safari in iOS devices? do i have to download a safari extension?
2 [2017-01-30T22:17:29] <propaul> package demos;import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver;public class Test4 { [<-CODE->] }
3 [2017-01-30T22:17:54] <Edge-Man> are you testing a native iOS app or Web application on iOS?
4 [2017-01-30T22:17:56] <propaul> this doesn't seem to work
5 [2017-01-30T22:18:04] <propaul> web app
6 [2017-01-30T22:18:41] <Edge-Man> here you go: [<-LINK->]
7 [2017-01-30T22:20:01] <propaul> would this work for appium 1.6.3 and iOS version 10.2?
8 [2017-01-30T22:21:26] <propaul> WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();driver.get(" [<-LINK->] ");
9 [2017-01-30T22:21:41] <propaul> would i still have to input this into my script?
10 [2017-01-30T22:22:15] <Edge-Man> here an example from  the link I posted: ```// java//setup the web driver and launch the webview app.DesiredCapabilities desiredCapabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();desiredCapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.BROWSER_NAME, "Safari");URL url = new URL("http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub");AppiumDriver driver = new AppiumDriver(url, desiredCapabilities);// Navigate to the page and interact with the elements on the guinea-pig page using id.driver.get("http://saucelabs.com/test/guinea-pig");WebElement div = driver.findElement(By.id("i_am_an_id"));Assert.assertEquals("I am a div", div.getText()); //check the text retrieved matches expected valuedriver.findElement(By.id("comments")).sendKeys("My comment"); //populate the comments field by id.//close the app.driver.quit();```
11 [2017-01-30T22:24:12] <propaul> would it be same for real device? i just have to input udid # and change the iOS version?
12 [2017-01-30T22:26:42] <Edge-Man> the code yes, but there's a setup process that is different the instructions are listed in the link I provided. If you read through it, it should have everything you need to know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2016-12-01 21:10:41] <mmcintyre123> What languages are everyone using for writing tests?  MochaJS?  Ruby?  Python?  What do you think is best?
[2016-12-01 21:50:47] <travstatham> I use Java
[2016-12-01 21:50:53] <mikesalvia> I use Java and Groovy
[2016-12-01 21:50:58] <mikesalvia> Well Groovy (on Java)
[2016-12-01 21:51:09] <travstatham> it's a JVM right?
[2016-12-01 21:51:28] <mikesalvia> Groovy? Yeah it compiles down to Java and runs on JVM.
[2016-12-01 21:53:34] <mmcintyre123> Interesting.  I just took a crash course in Python and liked it a lot.  I'm using MochaJS though and also like that and have found really great help with it.  Does anyone use Python and if so are there any qualities such as debugging tools or special libraries that you think would not be available in other languages?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Part 2: content-desc
1 [2017-01-18T09:57:48] <jeevanbhushetty> any idea how can I locate an element on different android version which has only "content-desc" attribute
2 [2017-01-18T09:58:20] <coding-yogi> long time since I worked on appium, does content-desc map to name or to text?
3 [2017-01-18T09:59:40] <jeevanbhushetty> I tried googling it says name..
4 [2017-01-18T09:59:52] <jeevanbhushetty> by which I was unable to locate using name
5 [2017-01-18T10:01:49] <coding-yogi> worst case u can always try npm uninstall and then npm install
6 [2017-01-18T10:02:00] <coding-yogi> it will just reinstall all the dependencies
7 [2017-01-18T10:24:08] <coding-yogi> name should ideally work
8 [2017-01-18T10:24:10] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-01-18T10:24:52] <coding-yogi> what I can make out from this code is in case of Name, it searches by Content description and text as well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T13:54:51] <forki> ok if noboday knows then another question: can I somehow exit a text input field?
2 [2017-01-05T17:38:09] <hardik-d> not clear@forkiwhat do you mean by exit a text input field
3 [2017-01-05T17:38:44] <hardik-d> click on a different element or some and you will exit
4 [2017-01-05T20:04:51] <forki> hardik-d: yes but then I need to guess an element that has no action.
5 [2017-01-05T20:20:51] <RatkoD> no need to guess, click on some logo or picture or something. Not everything is clickable
6 [2017-01-05T20:21:40] <forki> ok - not exactly what I want but seems the only way
7 [2017-01-05T20:31:41] <hardik-d> yes, usually you enter some text and take some other action like submit a button or verify other elements etc.
8 [2017-01-05T20:32:43] <hardik-d> hope you are not trying to hide the keyboard or some
9 [2017-01-05T20:41:30] <forki> the problem with is that you need to click twice
10 [2017-01-05T20:41:54] <forki> at least when a text box has focus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-20T10:49:12] <coding-yogi> The problem I faced with Protractor is, as soon as it invokes app, it immediately tries to inject protractor javascript into webview
2 [2017-01-20T10:49:55] <coding-yogi> in cases of splash screen or 1st screen as native screen, injection of protractor script fails due to absence of any webview
3 [2017-01-20T10:50:18] <coding-yogi> if you can dump the appium log here, that would be helpful
4 [2017-01-20T10:51:04] <jeevanbhushetty> Same thing I was am facing.. I added caps.setCapability("appWaitActivity", "your Main activity name");
5 [2017-01-20T10:51:49] <jeevanbhushetty> but this is for java + appium not sure if you can do it in protractor..
6 [2017-01-20T10:52:08] <coding-yogi> what do u get in the server log?
7 [2017-01-20T10:55:49] <jeevanbhushetty>  [<-CODE->] It was stopping server at launch.. and it was random...
8 [2017-01-20T10:56:25] <jeevanbhushetty> sometime it used to launch app successfully and sometimes it was showing me above issue..

1 [2017-01-25T14:49:02] <ckilesse-daitan> Hello, all!I'm having some trouble trying to scale my Appium tests and I'm interested in hearing from people who are running multiple Appium servers for running tests in parallel.My initial idea was to run appium on Docker on cloud machines for Android but that didn't work since I was only able to run arm on cloud and it's too slow for my needs. For iOS I didn't come up with anything other than handling multiple machines/devices myself or paying for a solution like SauceLabs.Has anyone solved this in another way and can share how you are doing it?
2 [2017-01-25T15:14:15] <RatkoD> try this [<-LINK->]
3 [2017-01-25T16:15:04] <ckilesse-daitan> This looks good, but it seems to solve the issue of running the same tests across multiple different devices. My goal is to actually speed up the test execution by parallelizing the execution of a same test suite across multiple appium servers.
4 [2017-01-25T16:16:53] <ckilesse-daitan> We have about 300 jbehave tests using Appium and they are taking near 7 hours to complete and this is just too much. BTW, does this look reasonable to you guys? 300 Appium tests in 7 hours?
5 [2017-01-25T17:37:45] <hardik-d> i had file an appium support issue where on ios after upgrading to XCUITestDriver my test runtime has more than doubled
6 [2017-01-25T17:38:28] <hardik-d> i have around 100 tests which take almost 3 hours on ios so 300 tests in 7 hoursaligns along those lines
7 [2017-01-25T17:38:51] <hardik-d> android is much faster though
8 [2017-01-25T17:39:04] <hardik-d> earlier android used to be hella slow
9 [2017-01-25T17:40:15] <hardik-d> i don't know of any solution for ios other than what you are doing with multiple machines, OS limitation i guess
10 [2017-01-25T18:00:20] <ckilesse-daitan> hardik-d: @RatkoDthanks for your inputs!

1 [2016-12-23 12:06:36] <RatkoD> I would like to know if there is something else on the market. I've asked previously in this chat about Hive CI, but there was no response.

1 [2016-12-16 14:00:32] <lionel-pushios> To start the Appium server, the command is "appium" but what is the command to run a file against the server, "something filename.js"? I'm a newbie to Appium
2 [2016-12-16 21:57:31] <kidmillions> lionel-pushios: you'll want to make requests to the appium server. The easiest way to do this is with a webdriver client.
3 [2016-12-16 22:23:25] <lionel-pushios> thanks@kidmillionsno I was having trouble to actually run a JavaScript file to utilize Apple's XCUITest framework, but I realize now I needed the xcuitest-driver and then I can just use the Mocha commands

2 [2016-12-21 09:09:16] <RatkoD> blueice349: You can try the AppiumTestDistribution framework from@saikrishna321 [<-LINK->] 
3 [2016-12-21 09:11:02] <RatkoD> it works fine with android devices and ios until 9.x version, but I have troubles making it work with iOS 10, Appium 1.6.x and xCode 8.2

1 [2016-12-22 22:13:33] <jfricker> Hello. Anyone know when Appium will support Xcode 8.2?
2 [2016-12-22 23:14:17] <RatkoD> it supports
3 [2016-12-22 23:14:28] <RatkoD> install appium 1.6.3

3 [2017-01-22T22:35:33] <RatkoD> probably because of problems with signing of the webdriver

3 [2016-12-27 05:19:57] <ajit-jadhav> other than UI Automator viewer and Appium inspector.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-05T22:30:47] <SteffenL> Is Appium 1.6.3 supposed to be able to run multiple Android emulators concurrently assuming I use separate Appium server instances?
2 [2017-01-05T22:32:27] <SteffenL> Whenever I try to do it, Appium just cannot seem to handle it. For example, one server instance is supposed to handle one emulator but then it telnets into the other emulator or something.
3 [2017-01-05T22:32:50] <SteffenL> Maybe that's not even it, but it tries to do something with both emulators.
4 [2017-01-05T22:33:38] <SteffenL> Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not)
5 [2017-01-05T22:35:04] <SteffenL> Not just that. I actually cannot even reliably run tests on two different emulators sequentially.
6 [2017-01-05T22:35:25] <SteffenL> Sometimes works, sometimes not
7 [2017-01-05T22:36:20] <SteffenL> All these problems lead me to think that Appium is not meant to support it, even through I have read various places that one can do it anyway.
8 [2017-01-05T22:42:34] <hardik-d> i used to do it previously
9 [2017-01-05T22:42:47] <hardik-d> haven't tried on 1.6.3
10 [2017-01-05T22:43:21] <hardik-d> "Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not)" this is must
11 [2017-01-05T22:47:53] <hardik-d> $ appium -p 4754 -bp 4756 -U "192.168.56.101:5555" --chromedriver-port 9527// -p is appium port, -bp is bootstrap port, -U is UDID for emulators, --chromedriver-port// to get UDID for genymotion emulators, launch desired emulator then type below:$ adb devices// finally launch tests by passing in additional params$ PORT=4754 UDID=192.168.56.101:5555 PLATFORM=android rspec -b appium_test
12 [2017-01-05T22:47:56] <SteffenL> Thanks for replying
13 [2017-01-05T22:48:11] <hardik-d> this is what has worked before
14 [2017-01-05T22:48:21] <hardik-d> check the ports i am using
15 [2017-01-05T22:48:38] <hardik-d> they have to be 10# apart from one instance to another
16 [2017-01-05T22:49:39] <SteffenL> Hmm. Isn't -U the same as --udid ?
17 [2017-01-05T22:49:57] <hardik-d> ofcourse i use UDID and PORT in my caps
18 [2017-01-05T22:50:25] <SteffenL> Sorry
19 [2017-01-05T22:50:38] <hardik-d> yes but you start your server and tell it the UDID and have to tell your test code the same
20 [2017-01-05T22:50:57] <SteffenL> When I run my tests, I have emulators with UDID "emulator-5554" and "emulator-5556". How do I know what to tell Appium?
21 [2017-01-05T22:51:37] <SteffenL> Or does the parameter set the UDID in the emulator as well?
22 [2017-01-05T22:52:19] <hardik-d> in ruby
23 [2017-01-05T22:55:04] <SteffenL> Hmm. Not sure what that appium_lib is so I will check that out. Maybe I could just put the UDID inside my "default-capabilities.json" file?
24 [2017-01-05T22:55:08] <hardik-d> so basically you have to tell your driver to talk to which port
25 [2017-01-05T22:55:59] <hardik-d> figure ^^ out in whatever appium client lib you are using
26 [2017-01-05T22:56:16] <hardik-d> you using java/python/js?
27 [2017-01-05T22:56:21] <SteffenL> Python
28 [2017-01-05T22:56:39] <SteffenL> I tried to set the UDID to something random so maybe that is the problem.
29 [2017-01-05T22:56:40] <hardik-d> k
30 [2017-01-05T22:57:15] <SteffenL> I just do not know what/who decides what the UDID of the emulator will be.
31 [2017-01-05T22:57:25] <SteffenL> If it's Appium then maybe it will work.
32 [2017-01-05T22:57:36] <hardik-d> server has to know exact UDID to talk to and your driver  has to know what UDID and appium port to talk to
33 [2017-01-05T22:57:57] <hardik-d> UDID is unique per device/emulator
34 [2017-01-05T22:58:03] <hardik-d> has nothing to do with appium
35 [2017-01-05T22:58:16] <SteffenL> So maybe it's set when I create the AVD then
36 [2017-01-05T22:58:21] <hardik-d> yes
37 [2017-01-05T22:58:22] <SteffenL> Okay I will try :D
38 [2017-01-05T22:58:31] <hardik-d> if your emulator/avd is running
39 [2017-01-05T22:58:44] <hardik-d> typing adb devices should give you the UDID
40 [2017-01-05T22:59:51] <SteffenL> Thank you, Hardik! I will be right back. Need to switch from Windows to macOS where I do the development/testing.
41 [2017-01-05T23:06:07] <SteffenL> Hmm. I do not think it worked out the way I expected.
42 [2017-01-05T23:07:42] <SteffenL> I launched one emulator (Android 5.1) andadb devicesgave me "emulator-5554". Then I quit the emulator and launched another one (Android 7.1). This time,adb devicesalso gave me "emulator-5554".
43 [2017-01-05T23:09:28] <SteffenL> If I then start up the first emulator again (Android 5.1), its UDID appears to be "emulator-5556".
44 [2017-01-05T23:10:31] <SteffenL> I don't know but maybe this is a problem for Appium?
45 [2017-01-05T23:14:37] <SteffenL> I have an idea. I can try to use the avdArgs capability to pass the "-port" parameter to the emulator. "Set the console port number for this emulator instance to <port>. The console port number must be an even integer between 5554 and 5584, inclusive. <port>+1 must also be free and will be reserved for adb."
45 [2017-01-05T23:15:08] <SteffenL> That may make the UDID consistent at least.
46 [2017-01-06T04:41:39] <SteffenL> In the end, I decided to create an issue on GitHub: [<-ISSUE->]

1 [2016-12-26 17:36:16] <mbuckbee> I'm evaluating testing solutions and Appium seems great but there are a few things I haven't been able to figure out if it can do:
2 [2016-12-26 17:36:49] <mbuckbee> Can any app in an emulator be scripted, or does it have to be one that you're developing yourself?
3 [2016-12-26 17:37:52] <mbuckbee> Specifially, I'm trying to build a solution for testing how emails display in different email clients and would love to have an automated way to test against Apple Mail on iOS devices.
4 [2016-12-26 19:16:47] <RatkoD> mbuckbee: you can interact only with your app, no other app can be used during the test.
5 [2016-12-26 19:20:10] <mbuckbee> RatkoD: I'm thinking that's some app restriction limitation and not specific to appium?
6 [2016-12-26 19:52:03] <RatkoD> the limitations come from apple
7 [2016-12-26 19:52:13] <mbuckbee> Yeah, that's what I figured.
8 [2016-12-26 19:56:48] <mbuckbee> So, to do this I'd either need to do click/swipe from an OSX mac or jailbreak (which I was trying to avoid).
9 [2016-12-26 20:14:05] <RatkoD> I think there is no cure for this, it's simple, apple would not allow you to interact with other apps
10 [2016-12-26 20:14:16] <RatkoD> not iven with clicking on coordinates
11 [2016-12-26 20:14:19] <RatkoD> or anything
12 [2016-12-26 20:14:32] <RatkoD> I don't know how jailbraking will help here
13 [2016-12-26 20:20:21] <mbuckbee> RatkoD: I found a couple listed solutions that were:
14 [2016-12-26 20:20:29] <mbuckbee> Jailbreak the device
15 [2016-12-26 20:20:35] <mbuckbee> Install a VNC client on the device
16 [2016-12-26 20:20:54] <mbuckbee> User our library to remotely run commands against the device
17 [2016-12-26 20:21:21] <mbuckbee> mbuckbee: also does not know how to do numbering in Gitter apparently
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 [2017-01-27T10:12:31] <RatkoD> Hey guys, does anyone knows a solution for the Too many instances of this service are already running error
2 [2017-01-27T10:12:54] <RatkoD> it happens all the time, even after just a few tests, and I need to reboot the tested device
3 [2017-01-27T10:13:17] <RatkoD> and it's a pain in the ass to do this all the time
4 [2017-01-27T10:14:29] <RatkoD> or nobody here is using appium 1.6+ because it's actually unusable with all the bugs and things not working
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 [2017-02-06T08:06:41] <imranreee> i'm trying to scroll up the page of a android application, i'm using below method, but its not working, is there any other way ?

5 [2017-02-06T08:11:38] <coding-yogi> Support for such actions was removed long back
6 [2017-02-06T08:11:52] <coding-yogi> Why r u using execute script for swiping
7 [2017-02-06T08:40:20] <imranreee> aniket-21: so, could you please tell me which method i can use?
8 [2017-02-06T09:00:00] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
9 [2017-02-06T09:02:07] <imranreee> Thanks, Let me check.@aniket-21
10 [2017-02-06T09:08:04] <imranreee> which method i have to call for page scroll up?
11 [2017-02-06T09:08:13] <imranreee> SwipeElementDirection    this one ???
12 [2017-02-06T09:08:45] <coding-yogi> swipeElementDirection is class name
13 [2017-02-06T09:10:02] <imranreee> swipe   ?  from 202 line ?
14 [2017-02-06T09:10:21] <coding-yogi> yes
15 [2017-02-06T09:10:50] <imranreee> and for left and right swiping ?
16 [2017-02-06T09:13:15] <coding-yogi> offset determines the direct
17 [2017-02-06T09:13:18] <coding-yogi> direction
18 [2017-02-06T09:14:09] <imranreee> sorry, i didn't get you ?
19 [2017-02-06T09:15:11] <coding-yogi> see the code
20 [2017-02-06T09:15:12] <coding-yogi> int startX = getStartX(p, location, size, offset1);int startY = getStartY(p, location, size, offset1);int endX = getEndX(p, location, size, offset2);int endY = getEndY(p, location, size, offset2);
21 [2017-02-06T09:16:35] <coding-yogi> although I am finding this code little weird
22 [2017-02-06T09:17:23] <imranreee> that means swipe method for all (scroll up, left swiping and right swiping )
23 [2017-02-06T09:18:46] <coding-yogi> my bad
24 [2017-02-06T09:18:51] <coding-yogi> don't use that code
25 [2017-02-06T09:18:56] <coding-yogi> use touch actions
26 [2017-02-06T09:18:58] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
27 [2017-02-06T09:20:06] <coding-yogi> because where ever there is swipe code, I see the comment that its deprecated and will be removed
28 [2017-02-06T09:20:25] <coding-yogi> better to use touchActions than breaking your code at later point of time
29 [2017-02-06T09:23:40] <imranreee> Thanks a lot@aniket-21for you replay

1 [2016-12-29 11:30:40] <bakiko> Don't work driver.findElement(By.XPATH,"//AppiumAUT/XCUIElementTypeApplication") for Appium 1.6.3? [iOS real device]
2 [2016-12-29 13:09:09] <bakiko> not working with driver.findElement(By.xpath("//XCUIElementTypeApplication"))
3 [2016-12-29 13:11:19] <mgmanikandan87> bakiko: //XCUIElementTypeApplication  this is not full xpath
4 [2016-12-29 13:11:27] <mgmanikandan87> its just applicaiton window
5 [2016-12-29 13:11:29] <mgmanikandan87> level
6 [2016-12-29 13:11:38] <mgmanikandan87> you need to give  exact element
7 [2016-12-29 13:35:08] <bakiko> mgmanikandan87: thank you. I have tried this "driver.findElement(By.xpath("//XCUIElementTypeApplication/XCUIElementTypeWindow/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeOther/XCUIElementTypeNavigationBar/XCUIElementTypeOther[3]/XCUIElementTypeOther"))" and it is working. Is it possible to use this format for find the element xpath (driver.findElement(By.xpath("//[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[0]/[3]/[0])?
8 [2016-12-29 13:35:56] <mgmanikandan87> //XCUIElementTypeNavigationBar/XCUIElementTypeOther[3]/XCUIElementTypeOther
9 [2016-12-29 13:36:04] <mgmanikandan87> i think this should work
10 [2016-12-29 13:36:57] <mgmanikandan87> driver.nagivate().back();
11 [2016-12-29 13:37:01] <mgmanikandan87> this should work
12 [2016-12-29 13:44:23] <bakiko> mgmanikandan87: thank you. It is working!!!! 
13 [2016-12-29 13:44:56] <mgmanikandan87> cool
14 [2016-12-29 13:45:07] <mgmanikandan87> //XCUIElementTypeOther[3]/XCUIElementTypeOther
15 [2016-12-29 13:45:18] <mgmanikandan87> even this should work
16 [2016-12-29 13:45:20] <mgmanikandan87> try it

1 [2017-01-05T20:53:21] <guysegal> is someone here using appium with react native? Does you experience difficulties getting elements by accessibility strategy? It seems that testID etc. behaves differently between iOS and Android
2 [2017-01-06T10:14:21] <forki> guysegal: so testID has an observable effect for appium for you? I set it for a couple of images in my react native android  app and appium pagesource didn't change at all. How is this supposed to work?
3 [2017-01-06T11:34:31] <guysegal> forki: I'm adding these properties to the component props:
4 [2017-01-06T11:34:31] <guysegal> { testID: testID, accessible:true, accessibilityLabel:testID }
5 [2017-01-06T11:35:04] <guysegal> in android it works in most of the places you'll put it. I'm having difficulties to understand how it works is iOS
6 [2017-01-06T11:35:31] <guysegal> a component that have these props is reachable by appium android, but not always in appium ios
7 [2017-01-06T11:35:39] <guysegal> I'm probably doing something wrong
8 [2017-01-06T11:35:47] <guysegal> Anyone ever executed test with two android devices connected to the same appium server? I'm getting this error message:
9 [2017-01-06T11:36:45] <guysegal> "A new session could not be created. Details: Problem getting session data for driver type AndroidDriver; does it implement 'get driverData'?"
10 [2017-01-06T11:37:15] <guysegal> the weird thing is that the same test with iOS & Android devices connected runs successfully
11 [2017-01-06T11:43:50] <forki> guysegal: how do you find that element after that in appium? what is your selector?
12 [2017-01-06T12:00:41] <guysegal> yes I am. I'm using accessibility selector
13 [2017-01-06T12:22:12] <forki> no xpath?
14 [2017-01-06T12:22:36] <forki> I always thought testID would somehow map to a resource-id

9 [2016-12-28 12:30:49] <vfennerac> its kinda weird that we need team id and profile just to run browser tests
10 [2016-12-28 12:31:05] <vfennerac> thanks for the link and vid, will give it a try
11 [2016-12-28 12:38:50] <vfennerac> what if I don't have a team do give to appium?
12 [2016-12-28 12:39:05] <vfennerac> all I want to do is automated browser testing on the iphone
13 [2016-12-28 12:53:33] <RatkoD> Well, you should ask Apple for the logic. Their idea is that you need to pay for a dev account, you cannot develop without dev account, since you develop, you need to test the app, so for testing you need dev account.

1 [2017-01-25T13:18:28] <mvanevery> hey all , I am working in a react-native app and I am trying to scroll a specified section of the page.  I can't get the scroll to happen at all.  Anyone have any ideas as to what I can do to make the scroll happen?
2 [2017-01-25T13:24:11] <coding-yogi> Hw r u scrolling
3 [2017-01-25T13:24:21] <coding-yogi> What does appium log say when u scroll
4 [2017-01-25T13:31:56] <mvanevery> I am working through a webdriverio framework and using appium through that. the only thing I see in the appium log is -

7 [2017-01-25T13:39:03] <mvanevery> apparently its an HTTP protocal issue meaning "not implemented"
8 [2017-01-25T13:39:14] <mvanevery> I will have to look further into this
9 [2017-01-25T13:40:55] <coding-yogi> Ya cos scroll is no more there
10 [2017-01-25T13:41:00] <coding-yogi> U shud use swipe

1 [2017-01-30T18:23:25] <mmcintyre123> Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!!
2 [2017-01-30T18:25:07] <mmcintyre123> Icanlaunch the app in the simulator from within Xcode, which is strange.  So I am wondering if there is some conflict or incorrect setup of the new automation drivers...

5 [2017-01-25T21:36:11] <Edge-Man> need to use appium 1.6.3

9 [2017-01-25T21:55:11] <Edge-Man> yeah, there's no .dmg for Appium 1.6.3, this is something the guys are working on
10 [2017-01-25T21:55:13] <Edge-Man> so..
11 [2017-01-25T21:55:20] <Edge-Man> you have to install it via command line

14 [2017-01-25T21:55:54] <hardik-d> you are on sierra
15 [2017-01-25T21:56:16] <hardik-d> downgrade to mac os 10.11
16 [2017-01-25T21:57:13] <Edge-Man> Appium 1.6.3 works for me with Sierra
17 [2017-01-25T21:57:34] <Edge-Man> but I think what hardik is saying that Appium 1.5.3 doesnt work with Sierra?
18 [2017-01-25T21:59:25] <Edge-Man> and it wont work with Xcode 8.2.1  because apple remove the old instrumentation that drives it, so it shouldn't work. So if you want to use appium 1.6.3, you have to roll back Mac OS to 10.11 and roll back to an older version of Xcode =  Xcode 8.0 pre.  and you wont be able to test on iOS 10
19 [2017-01-25T22:03:08] <cbiermannIMVU> Got it
20 [2017-01-26T00:54:36] <hardik-d> Edge-Man: i have seen folks complaining about 1.6.3 not working on sierra
21 [2017-01-26T00:54:46] <hardik-d> hence hesitant to upgrade
22 [2017-01-26T00:55:23] <hardik-d> did you upgrade from el cap to sierra or was it a brand new machine?

23 [2016-12-12 05:25:26] <tekisrinivas20> Divya-tfw: can you try start apium server with override exist session..
24 [2016-12-12 05:25:36] <Divya-tfw> mgmanikandan87: : So now how can I delete cache data and start run ?or any other alternative for the problem
25 [2016-12-12 05:26:06] <Divya-tfw> override exist session ? where is that option ? Appium or shud i add in capabilit
26 [2016-12-12 05:27:24] <tekisrinivas20> In apium server settings u can find override exist session check box..u can check it
27 [2016-12-12 05:27:40] <mgmanikandan87> Rahul-Chulliparambil: are you using GUI or command line tool
28 [2016-12-12 05:27:40] <Divya-tfw> ok let me check
29 [2016-12-12 05:27:40] <mgmanikandan87> ?
30 [2016-12-12 05:28:18] <mgmanikandan87> Divya-tfw: override exist session means will override exit session for next run it won’t create new session
31 [2016-12-12 05:29:46] <Divya-tfw> Then scripts will fail I guess, as new session will be created evry time when we run scripts .Now since its over riding that if some thing fails , then it will abort execution
32 [2016-12-12 05:30:21] <mgmanikandan87> Divya-tfw: can you post your appium full logs here ?
33 [2016-12-12 05:30:50] <Divya-tfw> Logs will throw error as Element not found and continues with next script
34 [2016-12-12 05:32:25] <mgmanikandan87> can you post whole appium logs
35 [2016-12-12 05:32:42] <Divya-tfw> ok will post .Let me give run and send u
36 [2016-12-12 05:32:52] <mgmanikandan87> ok
37 [2016-12-12 05:34:36] <tekisrinivas20> In my case also I was able to run first test successfully. for second script it is failing. this solution solved for me..
38 [2016-12-12 05:35:03] <Divya-tfw> ok .let me try
39 [2016-12-12 05:35:56] <Rahul-Chulliparambil> I am using eclipse IDE
40 [2016-12-12 05:41:05] <Rahul-Chulliparambil> mgmanikandan87: : Do you have any properly running  appium code ?
41 [2016-12-12 05:50:18] <mgmanikandan87> Rahul-Chulliparambil: yes
